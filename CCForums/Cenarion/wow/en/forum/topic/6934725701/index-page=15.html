<em>The morning arose with a warm sun, and the sounds of crickets chirping in the garden. As Cyaer yawned and stretched, he smiled. He smiled in the knowledge that before this day closed, Kel'tira would be his wife. He lay back on the pillow, and thought of the ring he had bought. <br/><br/>It was a simple band of ghost iron that fairly glowed from the polishing the jeweler had given it. Or was it the enchantment that Cyaer had sough to have put on the ring. The ring would feel warm upon her finger, however it would truly show her his love when she found herself in a dire situation.<br/><br/>He had put a part of himself into the making and the enchantment of the ring. Some of it had left him weak over several days, but he knew it would be worth every moment of weakness and pain he endured. For when she found herself close to death, the ring would refresh her, raising her stamina, her strength, and most of all give her a fighting chance to survive. <br/><br/>He held the ring in his hand, and thought of his lady love, soon to be his wife. And he clenched it in his hand, feeling its warmth, and most of all its power. He had sold many of his prized possessions, and saved every coin he made to buy this for her. And it was worth every bit of the sum he paid, for he hoped that it would give Kel'tira the fighting chance she would need, and bring her back to him. <br/><br/>He fell asleep with the ring held in his fist, and a smile on his lips. He would need all the rest he could get, tonight would be his wedding night.</em>

<em> The day dawned bright and clear, and for the first time in months of sleeping alone, she did not reach for the space Nic would have filled in her bed, instead laying there under the sheets savoring the stillness, contemplating jut how far she had come. The birds in Silvermoon chirrup ex and sang grandly, and as Kel rose from the bed to don a dressing gown, she smiled brightly, unable to shake her happiness and wih no desire to do so. <br/><br/>Leaning on the windowsill to look out over the courtyard of her House, she whistled down at the songbirds, a cheerful little tune, and somewhere, a mocking bird whistled it back with an extra little trill on the end. <br/><br/>Kel grinned, and turned to the mirror to brush her hair out and dress, and it took her a long moment to realize that there was another person in the mirror behind her. <br/><br/>Turning to face her niece, Kel smiled, "Serelia, what can I do for you this morning?"<br/><br/>"I came to offer my wishes, Aunt. And," the younger woman grinned, producing a bouquet of white roses, "Even though I can't be there, here are the flowers I promised. They won't wilt before the wedding tonight." <br/><br/>Kel wrapped the younger Sunblaze in a hug, "Thank you, Sere. Stay safe tonight, alright? I know no one is supposed to die... But accidents happen. Do that much for an old woman on her wedding day?"<br/><br/>They both laughed, and Sere nodded and left, leaving Kel in he casuals with a bouquet of roses and a small list of thugs to do to prepare for the comig ceremonies. Cake. Drinks. Dinner. <br/><br/>She thought briefly, and decided she would indeed wear her hair up tonight, and then found herself wondering what her soon-to-be husband was up to. With a small laugh, she dismissed her own question and shouldered a small bag, traipsing out of her room and onto the streets of the city. She had some errands to run. Not the least of which was picking up a ring. </em>

<em>Ratheron was sitting at a table in the small barracks at Thrallmar, writing in his journal after the wedding and before he headed out on his assignment.</em><br/><br/>Today there was a wedding, a rather bland affair yet I will admit it seemed as if they grasped at it like it was a lifeline to save them from drowning. It bothered me deep down, so against my ideals, that they tie themselves to each other in a bond of love. It would only lead them down a dark path, yet how do you explain that to someone who has never witnessed the darkness of the Sha?<br/><br/>This Fellowship has seen darkness, but it has not seen the way the Sha can send entire races into the shadows never to return again. Their love will lead them to jealously and revenge should something happen that is unexpected and such emotions will turn them to anger and as they turn to anger they will fall prey to the Sha.<br/><br/>Such corruption is not merely contained within Pandaria, for now that the Mists have fallen it travels out beyond my home. I grow sad to know that it will find the rest of the world in turmoil and fall upon it with an eager energy built up over thousands of years. It was even worse when I learned they had spouses previously and that they are either dead or missing or they left them.<br/><br/>I know not nor care not, I should have controlled my tongue though however what I said was true. "Previous spouses? You must go through them like dogs." While harsh is as true as anything else I have said in their presence, I care not if they hate me for my honesty I will not let them walk ignorantly into the arms of the Sha.<br/><br/>There are enough like that already.

She was, and is, beautiful as she stood beside me, and we exchanged vows and rings. And now, I rejoice in being her husband, and and she my wife. Lady and Lord Sunblaze.<br/><br/>I lay beside her, and watch her sleep. And I thank my lucky stars. She is my day, she is my night, she is the half that makes me whole. I place my hand on her shoulder and she rolls over into me, and she snuggles close to me, and I hear her whisper my name softly. I vow to protect this woman I love. To be there when she needs me. And to love her and care about her for as long as I draw breath.<br/><br/>My arms go around her, and hold her close. I gently kiss her hair, and head, safe in the knowledge that she is here, and she is where she wants to be, with me. And that's all I want and need.

The blood elf Blood Knight arose from the barracks cot, and began to don his armor. He still owed for tuition, so he was working at the forge, creating weapons for the new initiates, and enjoying the company of his old mentor.<br/><br/>He strolled out and bought a small loaf of bread from a wandering vendor, and tore off a piece of the fresh morsel. He enjoyed the yeasty taste and crunchy crust. He nibbled on the warm bits of bread, as he walked over to the forges. He waved over to his friend and mentor, as he stoked the fires and watched them glow red hot.<br/><br/>"Neryth, whatever happened to that beautiful lady we created the statuette of? Are you still seeing her?<br/><br/>Neryth's voice was low as he spoke, " She died, my friend. Taken in the bloom of her youth." His voice choked a moment in his memory of the scout and rogue of the Rising Sun Fellowship, she had been his muse, the one who had opened his mind to the creative skills he had thought of as a hobby, a mere doodler. He still missed her touch, and her playful kisses.<br/><br/>"Aw, I'm sorry to hear that, lad. What of that lady I saw you walking the Exchange with? She seemed pretty into you, my boy."<br/><br/>"Aye, that would be Raviella. And we had our moment in the sun, she's gone to a different place, where she is needed, and I was not. I miss her terribly too."<br/><br/>"Lad, I am sorry, I bring up such sorrowful memories, let's get this ore melted down, shall we?"<br/><br/>"Aye." Neryth busied himself with smelting the copper and tin together and to create a smooth bronze mix. While his hands were busy with that, his mind roamed back to the moment when Raviella had opened his mind to the light, and how it had changed the way he used and felt about the light. She had been so beautiful, and helped him to forget the deceased Jahana. It had been a sad parting of the ways when she rode out of his life. But he would always be thankful for her. He stilll practiced her concentration and meditation methods, they helped him in his fighting.<br/><br/>Now he thought about how he was alone once again. And in a way it hurt, and in another he saw it as another chapter in his life. A chapter where he would grow stronger, and mature just as the bronze grew stronger from the two ores combined. He took away so much from Jahana, and Raviella, they had helped him grow in different ways, and he missed them both.<br/><br/>The day was long, and he worked hard beside his mentor. Finally, late into the night, they finished for the day. His friend clapped his large calloused hand on Neryth's broad shoulder, and shook him, and wished him a good night. Neryth smiled as he wiped off the sweat and ash from his face, and headed back to the barracks.<br/><br/>He opened the large sketch pad he used, and went back through the many pages. Sketches of Jahana, Raviella, and members of the Fellowship. He smiled and came to a large blank page. He stared at the page, and thought of how it represented his future. It was blank, to be written on and open to anything Neryth wanted to put there. He tucked the pad away, and lay down to sleep. His dreams were of the lovely Raviella, and her gentle kiss and soft skin.

<em>Tislina Dawnrunner was very busy these days. Between her studies, she rarely had time for herself. But tonight she did. She was attending an auction and ball, hosted by a wealthy nobleman. After much socializing, dancing, and drinking (Which she did not partake in), Tislina found herself in the one place she always seemed to end up. The library. The windows provided a view of the trees of Eversong Woods stirring gently in the night air under the stars. Tislina began browsing the books thoughtfully until she came to a pedestal with a vase sitting upon on it.<br/><br/>The vase was old, that much she knew. She leaned down to examine it closer...<br/><br/>"I wouldn't if I were you."<br/><br/>Tislina whirrled around to see a man standing behind her. He was dressed in a finely tailored suit, his long black hair pulled back into a pony tail. Amusement danced in his fel green eyes and a faint smile played on his lips. Tislina's eyes narrowed as she sensed the familiar feel of magic. Straong magic. And it was coming straight from him. "That vase is nearly ten thousand years old. I brought it back from Pandaria myself with the intention to auction it off tonight, as you see, I am an exoctic trader. But where are my manners? I forgot to ask who it is I am making the aqaintaince of?" he inquried, his tone slightly mocking.<br/><br/>Tislina, not one to back down anymore, raised her head and squared her shoulders. "I am Tislina Dawnrunner, daughter of Locien Dawnrunner and Eden Dawnrunner. Apprentice to Ayla Rainsong, soon to be an Arch mage," she finished, now very familiar with the many formalities she was expected to give.<br/><br/>He smirked. "My, a true lady indeed when your formalities are such a mouthful. Forgive me. but mine shall not be as in depth as yours. I am Adocate Lightwood, a high warlcok."<br/><br/>Tislina froze. A high warlock? That would explain the power he put off in such waves. And Tislina was not one to like warlocks anymore. "Well, it was pleasent meeting you, Mr. Lightwood, but I really should return to the party," she said formly.<br/><br/>He grinned, his eyes flashing. "If you must. I look forward to seeing you again in the furture, Ms. Dawnrunner."<br/><br/>Tislina, her back straight as a board, turned and took a step froward... right into the pedestal holding the vase. It tipped over, the vase falling, falling, falling. And then it shattered into a thousand pieces on the floor. "That," Adocate said, stepping up behind her and peering over her shoulder, "is not good."<br/><br/>"I am so sorry!" Tislina said in horror, her hands flying to her mouth. "Can we fix it with magic?"<br/><br/>Adocate shook his head slowly. "No... I'm afraid not... The vase was enchated, so it simply won't fix right."<br/><br/>Tislina turned to him then, her expression drawn. "I'm terribly sorry. I'll pay you back every cent of it's worth. How much was it?"<br/><br/>"Oh, the starting price was going to be around, oh, fifty thousand gold," he said casually, examining his nails as he leaned againt the wall.<br/><br/>Tislina's hand flew to her heart as her eyes widened and she gaped, swaying on her feet. "Did you... F-Fifty thousand..." she whispered. "I don't have that kind of money..."<br/><br/>He looked at her and feigned a look of sympathey. "Unfortunatley, I am a man who likes his money, so you'll have to pay me somehow. If you don't have the money, I'm afraid you'll have to sell me your soul."<br/><br/>Tislina's gaze hardened. This was exactly why she hated warlocks as she did. They were not to be trusted! Although her position was rather complicated. "Please," she begged. "There has to be some other way."<br/><br/>"Well," he said, a sly grin creeping onto his face. "I'm currently looking for a new business partner. If you were to, say, work for me, you could pay your new debt off, hm?"<br/><br/>"What," Tislina said, taking a deep breath, "Would this so called job included? Will I have to kill anyone?"<br/><br/>Adocate laughed. "What? Of course not! I would never ask a delicate lady such as yourself to do something such as murder. All this job would included is you keeping records, taking orders, working with numbers. You know, accounting. I need someone smart. And you look like you've got a brain. You'll work for me until you've paid back what you owe me. So, do we have a deal, Ms. Dawnrunner?" he asked with a wry grin, holding his hand out to her.<br/><br/>Tislina took a deep breathed, and deciding she didn't have any other choice, took his hand. "We have a deal."<br/><br/>"Excllent, Tislina!" he said entusiastically. He let go of her hand. "I would rather we use each others first names, as it will help us get to know one another better. What do you think, Tislina? Or do you prefer Tis?"<br/><br/>She shrugged. "I don't really care either way."<br/><br/>He chuckled. "In that case, you may call me Adocate. Or if it suits you better, Alec is fine too. I do look forward to working together."<br/><br/>Tislina sighed, wondering what she had gotten herself into to.</em>

<em>From the pages of my journal:</em><br/><br/>She's dead. After all the pain and hurt she has inflicted upon the members of the Rising Sun Fellowship, Viragona the warlock is finally dead. Kel'tira struck the mortal wound when her mace crushed her skull. And I began the fire to burn her body and heart, and every bit of her. As I watched her body burn and the smoke rose from her funeral pyre, I felt empty. Totally and completely empty.<br/><br/>I flew off, and prepared for a hot soaking bath and a night's rest. As I was laying in the tub, who should arrive but my lovely wife. She was covered with blood and ichor, and as she stepped into the bath, and lay against the back of the tub, I began washing her body, and allowing her to relax.<br/><br/>Viragona was not dead as I had thought when I flew off, she had found some way to take one of Kortanus' soul gems, and taken possession of a demon. It was after the death of the demon that Viragona was truly vanquished and defeated.<br/><br/>I washed her off and we lay in the hot water, with the fragrant soap filling our nostrils and allowing us to relax. Kel lay against my chest and I held her close. And I realized again just how much I have come to love this woman more and more.<br/><br/>As I dried myself, she enjoyed the water all around her, then I held up a fresh plush towel up for her, and as she stepped into it, I wrapped her up in it, and then wrapped my arms around her, and kissed her warmly and passionately, a kiss to tell how much I loved her.<br/><br/>I helped dry her, then I carried her to the bed, and we wrapped ourselves in the blankets and into each others arms. We talked into the night, and I have never felt as close to the real woman that is Kel'tira as I did last night. At one time, she held me as I lay my head on her shoulder, her arms tight about me, she softly sang to me. <br/><br/>I can only hope with the demise of Viragona, that Kel'tira can finally rest and relax. I know she felt relaxed the few days after our wedding, and seeing Kel'tira like that blesses my day like no other. I have found the one who completes me, and Kel'tira is her name. We really are a pair that found its other perfect half. She knows me so well, and I her. I love her so.

<em>Solorin walked into his house, he watched his wife as she lay in their bed...he was upset..sad...every emotion in the book, he could not stop thinking about this man the one who would hit on her... And for some reason...he felt like there was something going on between her and this warlock... And it hurt him... He sat down..and got out a quill and parchment, and wrote a note to her</em><br/><br/>Auxilia...<br/>Nothing has meant more to me than knowing that you really care and deep within my heart I know in the future I'll always find happiness in sharing my life with you. Some one so beautiful deserves nothing but the best....I'm not saying im the best....I'm not the best....I'm no where near it...but I am lucky to have you. Love is a feeling which can't be express in two or three words... It can only felt by the two true hearts. If I could give you one thing in life, I would give you the ability to see yourself through my eyes. Only then would you realize how special you are to me. And you know auxilia, We may love the wrong person and cry over the wrong person, but one thing is sure; mistakes help us find the right person and.... You are the truest love I'll ever find.<br/><br/> <em>He sat the quill down and kissed her on the forhead while she slept, he then curled up next<br/>To her and wrapped his arms around her and feel asleep in his spot..

She was a beautiful woman...and so it is with war, death is one of the factors that plays into it.<br/><br/>I have only known two women in my life, and I find both of them dead, cut down in their prime.

<em>Tislina Dawnrunner unentusiastically walked in to the Wayfarer's Rest. Generally, she liked to eat dinner here. The service was good, the food was good, and the people were good. What wasn't good? Adocate Lightwood smirking at her from her favorite table in the establishment. He stood as she approached and pulled out a chair for her.<br/><br/>"Remind me again why I'm having dinner with you," she said in a politely mocking way as he took his own seat again.<br/><br/>He smiled at her, the same amused light dancing in his eyes that always seemed to be there. "So that we can get to know one another better, of course. If we're going to be working together, we might as well know one another. So, tell me about you. Do you have any family? And would you like wine?" he asked, holding up a bottle.<br/><br/>Tislina shook her head. "No, I don't drink. And no, I really don't have any family. My parents are dead, my brother is dead, and my sister would like to kill me."<br/><br/>"How dreadful!" he said with mock sympathy as he poured himself a glass of the red wine. "Why would she want to kill you?"<br/><br/>Tislina shrugged. "I don't know. Jeleousy, maybe? She hates magic."<br/><br/>Adocate gave her a bewildered look. "Hates magic? You have a messed up family indeed, if you'll pardon me. How can anyone hate magic? Magic practically makes the world go 'round. You can do anything with magic."<br/><br/>Tislina gave him an irritated look. "Yeah, well, not everyone is gifted with magic. And lots of people hate it with good reason. Mostly because of people who misuse it, such as yourself."<br/><br/>Adocate laughed. "I feel as if you are attempting to insult me. However, I must warn you; I've heard every insult in the book and they rather don't bother me as they do others."<br/><br/>Tislina huffed, sparks flying off her fingers. "Well how about your family? What are they like?"<br/><br/>Adocate smiled apologetically. "That, I am afraid, is an off limits topic between the two of us."<br/><br/>Tislina's eyes narrowed. "Who are you to say that?"<br/><br/>Adocate chuckled. "I do believe I'm your boss and so, therefor, I make the rules. Let's move on. Are you associated with any sorts of groups?"<br/><br/>Tislina nodded warily. "Yes. The Rising Sun Fellowship. Ever heard of them?"<br/><br/>Adocate shurgged, than nodded absently as he traced the rim of his wine glass with his index finger. "I have. There's always rumors flying around about that group. Although, I'm sure you are thankful to hear, I have no comment for you about them."<br/><br/>"There's a shocker," Tislina said sarcastically, raising an eyebrow.<br/><br/>Adocate chuckled. "So tell me where you stand on the war with the Alliance. You look like you've got some opinions on that."<br/><br/>Tislina straightened. "I do. I think what the Horde is doing is right indeed, showing the Alliance what is and isn't theres."<br/><br/>Adocate gave her a flat look. "That's a lie and you know it. I'm assuming you're only telling me that because you're afraid to say what you really think about it. So I'll go first. I find the whole war completly ridiculous. The so called hereos that senselessly throw themselves against whatever our so called warchief tells them are nothing more than brainless idiots. However, I pretened to support the war as it makes me more profit considering the fact that I deal goods to the Alliance and the Horde. So, what do you really think?"<br/><br/>Tislina gaped at him. "I can't believe you! Okay, yes, I honestly think the war is completely pointless and should be stopped. But the other things you said? How dare you! Trading Horde goods to the Alliance, that's awful! And more importantly, how could you say such things about our soldiers! I'll have you know that the man I loved died in the war for what he believed in! can you say the same?"<br/><br/>"Um, no. Because if you will notice, I'm not dead," Adocate said with an infuriating grin.<br/><br/>Tislina opened and closed her mouth several times before she found her voice. "You know that's not what I meant! Have you ever fought for the Horde?"<br/><br/>Adocate shook his head. "No, I have not, and I don't ever intend too. Why would I put myself in harm's way for such stupid promises as empty honor and glory? Before you say anything else about our brave men in the field, think about your so called lover and look where honor and glory got him."<br/><br/>Tislina stood up abruptly. "You should be hanged."<br/><br/>Adocate laughed. "On what charges? That I'm a traitor? I honestly wouldn't mind that since technically I am."<br/><br/>Tislina stared at him, apalled. Her expresson hardened and she glared at him coldly. "I bid you a good night, Alec," she said, then spun on her heel and stormed off.<br/><br/>"Don't forget you have work tomorrow!" she heared him call gleefully after her.</em>

<em>The rain clouds were breaking up, and the night air was still cool and damp from the rain that had passed through. And seated on the steps of Sunsong Ranch was the quiet owner of the farm, Cyaer Sunblaze. He was soaking wet, having decided to sit out the rainstorm that had come through. Now he supposed others would just say he didn't have the common sense that the gods gave a goose to come get out of the rain. And in a way, he was sure they might be right, and that made him smile.<br/><br/>But the rain had cleansed him, and wiped away those foul thoughts he had harbored towards the warlock Viragona. The rain had covered the tears he had shed, as he thought of the pale blue eyed daughter he would never see grow up. And he let it all out during the storm, letting the storm that had raged within him, and had eaten him alive from the inside out, finally letting it go.<br/> <br/>And he sighed as he looked out over the rows of plants growing on his little plot, then he turned his head to look under the raised shed to see the big brown eyes of the sheep that he now called his own. He softly bleated, and they called back in their own voice, and this too made him smile.<br/><br/>He slowly looked up into the night sky and saw the myriad of stars twinkling in the dark skies, and he smiled again. He had always enjoyed looking up into a starry sky. He didn't know one star from another, he enjoyed them simply for the gentle light they cast.<br/><br/>Then for one brief moment he held his breath as he watched two small pale blue stars wink down at him; and he was amazed as he blinked away the tears in his eyes, he looked up once again and was unable to find the twin pale blue stars. So he gathered himself to head toward the inn, and a dry set of clothes.</em>

<em>from the pages of my journal:</em><br/><br/>They irk me to no end. And I am thinking with my expertise in cooking various dishes, I am going to begin skinning these filthy little vermin, and seeing about making a dip, or snack out of them.<br/><br/>I toil and work hard on my crops, and find myself at odds with the varmits around here. I have thought of poisons, but I fear that the poison will leech into my crops, and ruin them. So I slay them as I find them...and I think of how I can use them as a "crop" too, so that I no longer am wasting my time, but harvesting fresh meat. Maybe they would go well with turnips...<br/><br/>I find the time I spend in Skyrange very profitable, there are many ores and herbs waiting to be taken and sold in Ogrimmar. I fill at least one of my satchels when I go there to aid the Tillers. And I like helping my neighbors as much as I can.<br/><br/>However, as much as I enjoy the toiling and harvesting, I find my hands wanting to hold a fishing pole again. I may just set some time aside to go to Wilds and catching a full sack of fresh fish, shrimp and octopus. I wonder if Lady Sunblaze would care to join me?<br/><br/>I have neglected her in the House business, and I need to acquaint myself with the House affairs too. I don't think I fit into the picture one thinks of a noble. Maybe I need to start projecting a new image, one that Kel'tira will be proud of and that aids her in the House politics. If nothing else, maybe I can find me some House intrigues and secrets floating around.

<em>The monk was sitting at the edge of the steam pools at the Peak of Serenity, his back rigid as he meditated, floating maybe two meters off the ground. He had his journal open on his lap and he was letting his mind wander and spew thoughts onto the pages as he practiced his Zen Meditation.</em><br/><br/>I find I have growing qualms with this Fellowship, yet some stand out as beckons of hope for a better Fellowship should they allow it. It appears that they truly do let their emotions rule them so much so that a warlock by the name of Viragona seems to have plagued them for almost more than a year! Even my cousin Tyrael in all his mighty strength could only banish her, sadly he fell before he could finish the task. I learned this from Dalen, whom it seems fell out of touch with the Fellowship as he hunted his own demons. It seems our young nephew Tal'varus fell to a human whom was a friend of Dalen's.<br/><br/>I warned him against hatred but it was too little too late for him, he was lost and I sighed as he let him go. There was nothing I could do for him while he let his hate burn bright within him. I wonder if it is to fight fate to keep one's emotions in check yet I discard the thought immediately for how then could the Sha have been caged for a millenia or more?<br/><br/>I again shudder to think about what will happen to this Fellowship should the Sha make even more of an appearance in the rest of the world as they have in Pandaria. I sigh now for if it had not been for their unruly emotions and foolish pursuit I would not still be stuck here on the Peak recovering from an injury dealt by the warlock's Wraithguard.<br/><br/>I wonder if there is some way to aid them from outside, to show them that they will continue to fail and splinter for so long as they allow their emotions to <em>rule</em> them. Yet this will have to wait for another time to think on...

<em>From the pages of my journal:</em><br/><br/>When my love told me what happened, I will not lie, I could feel a rage building within me, and I wanted only revenge. However, two things came to mind, one...I continued to speak with my love, and promised her I would do nothing rash. I stayed close to her, and comforted her. Seeing the bruises administered to her, and the stab wound in her leg only infuriated me, and I felt helpless.<br/><br/>Two, I remember Ratheron the monk. Many do not like his brash and honest speech, however there is a tone of truth in it, whether you like it or not. He has mentioned many times our emotional outbursts only set us up for trouble in Pandaria. I tend to agree with this accessment. I have only fought with the sha a few times, and I found their attacks insidious and almost personal. Guilt, fear, and anger, each was difficult to face, but face them I did, and I came out of it victorious.<br/><br/>So now, I am trying to remain calm, and thoughtful. Thinking through what I must do. For this Death Knight does not only effect Kel'tira and myself, but the entire Fellowship. And while in my heart it causes turmoil, for he attacks my family if he attacks the Fellowship, I am meditating and breathing as the old Pandaren taught me. I release those negative thoughts, and build my resolve. <br/><br/>Kel'tira fears that meeting him may be my death, and that he might as well kill her also, as she would not want to go on without me. I will not meet with him. I merely seek information concerning him and what he wants. I will not endanger my wife's life with my own or her own. I want this taken care of and soon.<br/><br/>Would it be wrong of me to seek out the monk. He would be very methodical and sure of a kill. But is that what I want, or is it answers? I believe it is answers...for all of us.

<em>A neatly written letter sits on the desk of Kel'tira Sunblaze, an envelope folded beside it, the ink on the parchment still damp.</em><br/><br/>Ratheron,<br/><br/>I know we do not get along well. My ideals and yours tend to be at odds, and this is something we will both have to expect. But I have a task for you. A request.<br/><br/>There is a death knight who has the audacity and the strength to attack myself, and through me, the Fellowship. I am asking for your help in this matter. I need, we need, answers. We need a name. We need reasons, and motivations on his part, and we need him out of the way. Gone.<br/><br/>You are the best man for this task, as you have little to no emotional investment in the matter. I will tell you what I can of him, and where he took me.<br/><br/>(A sketch is inserted into the pages here, done in neat colors, the armor and what can be seen of his face under the hood picked out in neat detail, a thorough description follows. A portrait in inks and words, reminiscent of someone with experience in hunting people down.)<br/><br/>(The next page is a rather dry description of the death knight)<br/><br/>(The third and final page is only half-filled)<br/><br/>He found me in the Barrens, I was unprepared, and unaware I was being followed. He took me by surprise and knocked me out, and I woke in a cave in Dustwallow Marsh. The cave is in the Southern-most section of the swamp, set into the mountains bordering the Thousand Needles.<br/><br/>(This methodical description trails into a recounting of Kel's "stay" in the cave. It's clear from the diction that she is trying to remain positive.)<br/><br/>I need answers, Ratheron, and you are someone I believe I can count on to find them, and dispose of the threat.<br/><br/>Do what you deem necessary. The Fellowship and my House are behind you should you need anything.<br/><br/>Kel'tira Sunblaze, Lady of House Sunblaze, and leader of the Rising Sun Fellowship

<em>Tislina Dawnrunner sat at her mahogany desk in a room within the mage towers of Silvermoon. Technically speaking, the room wasn't hers. It was actually for Ayla's use, though her mentor didn't mind Tis using it for whatever purposes she might have. The desk, however, did belong to Tislina and so sat in one of the many alcoves within the room. The cluttered contents of the desk also belong to the young mage. There were several old tomes stacked in the corner, and papers upon papers concerning magical theory sat opposite the books. Tislina had pushed these things to the side approximately ten minutes ago and now sat staring at the only two things in front of her. The first was a black leather journal with an image of an entirely white rose on the cover. The second was a brand new peacock feather quill in a case.<br/><br/>Sighing, Tislina looked down at Mobious curled up on her bare feet. The little cheetah cub was snoozing in a patch of drowsy evening sunlight. She smiled softly and looked back at the journal. She flipped back the cover and looked at the first page, reading the words that were inscribed there:</em><br/><br/><strong>The dawn of beauty always comes after night.<br/>Hope is the soul of the dreamer.</strong><br/><br/><em>Taking a deep breath, Tislina opened the quill case and removed the long feather and carefully examined the vibrant colors of it. She absently pulled to ink well across the desk toward her and dipped the quill's tip in it. Turning to the first clean page, she set the quill to paper and began to write in her elegant cursive.</em><br/><br/>It's been a long time since I wrote down my thoughts. But I need too. It helps me keep organized. I received a new journal and a very fancy peacock feather quill. It was a gift. Seeing as though I seem to be starting a new chapter in my life, I find it fitting that I should start a new journal. My old one is safely at home where it will wait until I return to it one day to read it again. Now, where shall I begin?<br/><br/>My leaving seems as good a place as any, so we'll start there. I left Silvermoon for a time and I really mentioned it to no one. I left my guild stone off and at the bottom of my bag. I eventually found myself in Dalaran, city of mages. And I must say, it was as amazing as I had always hoped it would be. It was here, completely by chance, that I met Ayla Rainsong. She was a blood elven Arch Mage, looking to take on an apprentice. And I was looking for a mentor. I showed her what I could do with my magical skills after we had become friends, and, to my excitement, she agreed to take me as her apprentice.<br/><br/>Why did I leave in the first place? I frequently asked my self that question when I felt home sick and missed my friends, one in particular, I might add. It wasn't until I came home that I found the answer. I needed to find out who I was. I needed time to get away and think on things. My past, my choices, the present, the future. And I know who I am now. It's quite simple really. I'm Tislina Dawnrunner.<br/><br/>Moving right along, Ayla and I returned to Silvermoon where I found several other things. Once I was home and all settled, the first thing I did was to let the Fellowship know I was okay and that I had returned. I must say, I felt really good when I spoke with Kel and she was pleased to see me. It really reinforced the point that I found a family when I joined the Fellowship. It wasn't long after that I met someone new. His name was Kavriel Sunsorrow, and apparently he's the third brother of the three. He isn't like either of them though. He's rather...well frankly he's a tad rude. I mean, the way he refers to Xal and Sol! He has the audacity to call Xal a mute! His own brother! He also referred to Sol as the brute and wouldn't even mention Auxi by name, calling her instead the 'rouge woman.' Honestly, I'm not entirely sure I like him. But he asked me to tell Xal that he was invited to dinner with him, Sol, and Auxi. I agreed too. It was, afterall, an excuse to go and see him.<br/><br/>I found Xal in his office as I had expected, and I was completely overjoyed at how happy he was to see me. Although there was blushing. From both of us. I told him about meeting Kav, and in turn he told me about why Kav was never mentioned before. The story made me sad for Xal. It quickly evaporated though when Xal invited me to go to dinner with him. Dinner! Thankfully I managed a yes.<br/><br/>After that, I got the shock of my life. Krei is alive as a death knight. Our reunion did not go as one might expect. In fact, I spent nearly the whole thing crying. I told Krei it would be better if we went our seperate ways on the relationship level. Because how could I give him back all of my heart when I had fallen in love with someone else? It wouldn't have been fair to him and I honestly would not have been happy. So I have him some advice and wished him luck on finding someone to love him. I hope someone will.<br/><br/>(1/2)

The next night, I had dinner with Xal first, just he and I. Apparently Kav is a very bad cook. But Xal is an excellent cook. We talked for a long time and there was more blushing. Always lots of that. We went to our second dinner with Kav after. Kav basically wanted forgiveness from Sol and Xal. And they did forgive him, but he was making some very, very uncomfortable comments! He thought Xal and I were married! Which I told him in a stuttering fit that we were not. After Sol and Auxi had left, he had the nerve to ask what we were to each other! I told him we were friends. Very, very good friends. Xal seemed slightly disappointed by my answer, and truth be told I was completely disappointed. Kav left a little while afterwards, and Xal offered to walk me home. Of course I said yes.<br/><br/>He walked me all the way home and we stood on my porch for awhile. He apologized for Kav's remarks. I tried to brush them off, but I ended up babbling in and on. And then, right in the middle of a sentence, he kissed me! And I kissed him too! And then after that we talked about our feelings for each other. The things he said. Looking back, I'm amazed I didn't faint from happiness. All this time, while I had feelings for him, he also had feelings for me! And now we're together and I feel like the whole world is perfect.<br/><br/>I saw him again yesterday at the beach. We swam and caught fish for Fen, and he taught me how to shoot a bow. I surprised myself and found I was okay at it. We went back to my house after that, because he had left Mobious there for me. He's the most adorable cheetah cub ever! Right now, he's asleep in my feet. We sat and talked for a long time after about our families, but unfortunately he had work. So we kissed goodbye and I spent the rest of the evening reading.<br/><br/>Today I haven't done much but study with Ayla, which I don't mind. She's fun to work with and we have magical sparring all the time. Mobious spent the whole lessen chasing her cat, Crescent, around our private room. And now that my new journal is caught up with my life, I think I'm done for now. Oh! One more thing, I've heard that Kel was attacked by a death knight. I want to find her and make sure she's all right.

<em>The woman with the brown hair sat crossed legged on the ground underneath a tree. The wind blew past her, tugging on her hair and clothing as it rustled through the trees. On her lap was dark brown journal and in her hand was a letter that had been written by her husband. A small note that spoke of his love for her. They were words that had warmed her heart.<br/><br/>Slowly she wrote in the journal, something that she had not done in some time, despite the instructions of the monk she had been speaking to about a number of unsettled feelings that she had been having over the past three weeks. <br/><br/>***<br/>(New entry in a plain dark brown journal)</em><br/><br/>Firstly, an overdue ‘Happy Birthday’ to me. Since I have no idea as to when I was born, the day that I regained consciousness will work. Having been awake and without a memory for a full year has made me question a lot of things and my unrest has been growing for weeks. I am afraid that I have not been constructive on how I dealt with the things that have been bothering me.<br/><br/>For a long time now I have felt useless. Sol expressed that he wanted me at home, where I could be safe from harm, even while he headed off to the front lines to fight. He said that he did not like worrying about me while I was out and I can understand that. I certainly did not like staying up at night, unable to sleep when he was in the field or having my heart nearly jump out of my chest every time a horde soldier walked into the inn where I was staying for feat that they were coming to tell me that Sol was dead.<br/><br/>Luctarius asked if I had told Sol that I felt he was holding a double standard and that that made me angry. Of course I had not, I didn’t want to start a fight, but as Luc pointed out, sometimes it is better to have the fight and get it over with than let something stew for a long period of time.<br/><br/>He is correct. He also pointed out that part of the issue I was having was my own fault. I was not communicating… I would clam up and grit my teeth rather than speak my mind and be heard. Again… he is correct. I have a lot of work to do, it seems.<br/><br/>I told Sol about the warlock who hit on me. He was hurt, as I expected he would be, but I would rather it be out in the open—me being forward with my husband—rather than him finding out through someone else and getting angry with me for hiding it. If I wanted to leave Sol, I had the perfect opportunity. Instead, I turned the warlock away before anything happened and put as much distance between us as possible. I was willing to offer friendship—I know what it is like to struggle alone in the world—but I would not offer anything else. <br/><br/>What Sol chooses to do about it remains to be seen. I can only offer him the truth and whether or not he accepts it is out of my hands. At some point, he needs to understand that other people will find me interesting… and just because they do does not mean that I am running around behind his back. Of course his first wife did, and I am being measured by her actions and not my own. Perhaps this is another conversation I will have with him.<br/><br/>I love my husband, I do. He completes a part of me that was missing ever since I woke up. I do not regret the decision to wear his ring on my finger, even though there are times I just wish he follow through with his words and trust me. He says he does, but his actions sometimes speak differently. I am happy—but sometimes I feel that we are not always on the same page.<br/><br/>***<br/><em>She set the quill down and let the wind dry the ink on the pages. She leaned her head back against the tree and thought about the information that Orgrimmar had given her about the assignment. She would go, it was something that she needed to do, only this time, she would leave her things with Sol and not Kel. She just hoped that he would not overreact when she did.</em>

<em>Xal was never one for keeping a journal, he thought the things were pointless....always writing your feelings inside of a book for anyone to see at any givin time? Why do such a thing? but he thought it would be fine..just to keep track of his thoughts...to be able to read back and understand things.<br/><br/>he takes out a sky blue journal, brand new, he takes out his quill and starts to write.</em><br/><br/>I don't even know where to start? So...I guess Ill start with Tislina... <br/><br/>She is beautiful... she is wonderful...and even tho we have been together only a short time...she is my world....It all started the very first day she walked into my office....I looked into her eyes...and I fell for her...I really did, I've never..had anyone to call my own, Through out my schoolings, and trainings there was always girls trying to "Get with me" but I never thought about that kind of things....They didn't matter to me...but seeing her...I...I fell for her...I knew she was with Krei...and So out of respect, I never tried to make a move, or..anything of that sort...but I protected her...I always had an eye out for her...To make sure she was safe, because her safty is what matters to me most in this world...I care deeply for her...I do not know what love feels like...but I have a feeling Im close to experiancing it....the feelings i have had for her, i've had for a long time....and over that period of time...they have grown...and they have bloomed into some of the strongesst ones i have ever had...<br/><br/>I suppose I should write about my work next shouldn't I?<br/><br/>As of late, i have been doing alot of undercover work... Dressing fancy...getting to know my targets before I..Kill... I do not take pride in my work..but the pay is nice...and It's something im good at... I suppose thats all I have to write about today...<br/><br/> <em>He closes the journal, and rests it on his night stand..he lays down to rest...hopefully tis will come bother him and wake him up..He laughed and smiled at the thought...and set off to sleep.</em>

<em>Solorin, sat in his room and stared at the wall, pondering in his thoughts, and decided to write in his journal.</em><br/><br/>Me and my wife have a strong bond...and I know that I cannot be broken....I trust her... I honestly do, How am I supposed to trust her If i don't throw out chances every once in a while? I love her...I love her with all of my heart...she accepts me for all of my faults...and everything I once was, and that makes he happy....When next I see her..I will have to let her know how much she means to me... I have not a doubt in my mind..that me and Auxi will grow old together...with our children...I understand her job...just as she understands mine....just as she does not like me out on the front lines...I dont like her in the back....where I know they will likely expect her to be...she tends to get hurt....but I have to realize..she is a strong woman...and She can handle her self....I just happen to care maybe....a little to much...But tomuch is never enough...when it comes to the one you love... and I love her...with all of my heart....and all of my Reconstructed soul... *He laughs at the joke he made to himself* <br/><br/>And auxi should you ever find this journal entry...Realize that I love you..and I trust you...Do not ever doubt that I do not have faith in you...because I do...The reason I married you is because I love YOU...and No one else...Im sure that that is the same reason...you married me....Thank you for loving me...even though I am quite a fool at times...but you forgive me...and I appreciate that...I love you dear...<br/><br/>Sol~
