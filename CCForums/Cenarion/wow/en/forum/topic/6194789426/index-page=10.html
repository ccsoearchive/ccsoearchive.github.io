<em>The Rose watched quietly as the woman with the brown hair sat on the ground and leaned back against a pillar in the Undercity. The good thing about the Undercity was that the forsaken paid little heed to much of what was happening in their not-so-fair city. They were too absorbed in their own schemes.<br/><br/>It had taken some time, but she had finally located the means by which she would subdue her would-be rival. A few contacts and bribes later, the plan was ready to be executed. Now all she needed to do was wait a few minutes.<br/><br/>The blonde woman watched as Scarlet sipped the tea while she leaned back against the pillar. After several minutes, the Rose smiled. Scarlet rubbed a hand over her face for a second time then stopped. She looked at the mug of tea and the Rose could well imagine the look of horror on her face as she realized what was happening.<br/><br/>Scarlet tried to stand, but could not. The mug tumbled from her hand as she lost the struggle to keep conscious, her eyes closed and her body slumped forward. The mug rolled across the stone floor, the tainted tea running out from it in dark rivulets. <br/><br/>“Sweet dreams, my dear girl,” the Rose snarled sarcastically as she motioned for the undead she had hired to pick the other woman up. “You’re going to have a horrible headache when you wake up.” She paused and looked at the woman now thrown over the forsaken’s boney shoulder, that was probably going to leave a mark. “I suppose that I should thank you. You have just made me quite a bundle of gold.”</em>

Kel'tira Sunblaze<br/><br/>((Retroactive journal: Friday (?) and Saturday))<br/><br/>I sat there with him for three days. Three days I would have given up for him again in a heartbeat. The nights were the hardest, after that first morning, to sit there with him, watching him sleep. He looked so peaceful in a way, and I wondered what I was thinking to hurt him like I did.<br/><br/>When he woke, I was not honestly sure what to think, what to feel.<br/><br/>It does not matter, the words that were said, for I could not remember them if I tried, because all that matters is that we reached an agreement. And that I will never hurt my lover, my best friend, again.<br/><br/>Nicias... I never gave up on you. Never.<br/><br/>****<br/><br/>The rune. It spoke to me. Asking me to confess to my greed, confess to my desire for more than I can or should have. It spoke to me... <br/><br/>It reminded me of Cyaer, suggested that maybe it was greed that led me to do what I did. It reminded me of Nic, suggested that maybe it was greed that led me to cling to him, try to hold onto things when so clearly he did not want me back. It reminded me of the gold I could have taken, the choices I could have made to suit myself and not others, the days I could have spent for myself and not working for others.<br/><br/>And then it came back to the greed in my heart around Cyaer.<br/><br/>Ash's conversation with me did little to conclude anything, I have no idea why I even wanted to question her. I have no idea why I wanted to know the truth. I could have deluded myself and blamed some of what drove me to Cyaer on her curse, now I do not even have that.

I am a marked man, literally. The rune on my left cheek was changed, not nullified as I had originally thought. That damn warlock changed it to a rune of increased libido. Great, just flipping great. As if I don't have enough to worry about, now I bear this. <br/><br/>I went to Uldam. To see if I might find Karamia. I had to tell her what Sydric had said, and if she would listen, to hear my desire to hold her again. I found her sleeping, like the angel that she is, upon a high bed. I kissed her, but she didn't awaken, so I called her name, and she awoke. I could see the joy in her eyes at seeing me, but they soon clouded over again. And I feel the pain again of what I have done, what I almost did.<br/><br/>She seemed open to my explanation of the face rune, and also possibly cursed, that Viragona was still up to her old tricks. I think she forgave me, and we spent the day together. It felt good to hold her again, to kiss her sweet lips, and to hear her voice. It was just good to be with her again.<br/><br/>I can see it in her eyes, she hasn't really said anything, but she's hesitant to trust me, afraid of being hurt by me again. And I bear with it, because she's right. I hurt her more than I should have been allowed. I feel the pain of it when I see her looking at me sometimes. Even while I have some private time with her, I can feel it.<br/><br/>And I know that I can never let her down again. I almost lost her once, I won't lose her again. I can't. Something will curl up inside of me and die if I lose her again. Something good and true...something called love.

Diary of a Priest-Sydric Silverhawk<br/><br/>Dire things happened this day. The crazed mage Aseria has taken the Rune of Greed. Along with the strangeness of that, we have lost Cyaer it seems to the Rune itself. It has turned him into a stiffened statue of gold. For once I feel the curse of Viragona to bring us vexation, sorrow and hatred is working too well.<br/><br/>There is no way of knowing if releasing this Rune upon the world will have rippling effects as did the others or if it is not yet evident. We should keep a close eye on the Auction House and the general economy to note any major changes.<br/><br/>My only hope is that the Tome of Runes may have some help in counteracting these things. I await delivery from AAMS to see if my offer was accepted. I continue to gather herbs from Outland and grind them into pigments. My skills as a scribe are being sorely tested now. <br/><br/>My hope for the Fellowship is that we can come together to fight this as we always have. We must be strong, together. I pray the Light does not abandon Karamia. Make her strong...make her compassionate, and most of all give her hope that all will be right for her wedding day.

<em>The thoughts of a goldplated Cyaer Sunblaze -<br/><br/>I'm not dead? I can think? Where am I? What happened?<br/><br/>The rune possessed me, or rather I became obsessed by it. It told me things...things I didn't want to hear, but it told me anyways. It told me I was greedy wanting Kel'Tira and Karamia at the same time. It told me Kel'Tira still wanted me. It told me so many things. Lies, all lies.<br/><br/>It rests in the palm of my right hand now. Silent. I no longer listen to it siren's call. And I regret pulling weapons on my Fellowship members. Sydric, Solorin, and Kel'Tira, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I was not in my right mind. Come to think about it, I wasn't in my left mind either.<br/><br/>I messed up again. Kel'Tira tried to talk me out of it. She tried to tell me, and all I could think about was all that gold. Things I could buy Karamia, things she would be worthy of, that I could never buy her otherwise. The treasure, it could buy...nothing. You can't buy love. Karamia loves me for who I am, not what the rune said she wanted. I shouldn't have listened, I should have done a lot of things. <br/><br/>I cannot move. I don't even know if I'm breathing, or what. Magic. Gods I hate magic. I don't understand it, and I only know to kill the caster first. Magic. So I lie here in a cold room, without knowing a fig of where I am. I do know the gold effect faded after several hours. I can even see, not that it is much.<br/><br/>I think of my Karamia. We are to be wed in a fortnight. Will I be able to stand beside her and become her husband? Will we have our "someday"? Will she still have me, after my being so foolish? I think of her, her smile, her dancing eyes...and I cannot shed tears. I can only feel the ache of waiting to hold her in my arms again, and to tell her how much I love her and care for her. I have a second chance, please don't let me blow it now. Please.</em>

<strong>(<em>An ornate scarlett leather tome with an intricate gold lock and clasp, and gold-edged pages. The name Lyrilia Dawnblade is inscribed on the bottom left corner of the cover, in a flowing, gold script.</em>)</strong><br/><br/> My cousin sent me this book as a way to "sort out my thoughts and problems" so that I wouldn't have to "hide behind the mask I've created." What does my <em>dearest</em> cousin know of my thoughts? Nothing! Absolutely nothing thats what! So who is she to tell me me what to do? What I should do? She is no one to do such things, and can do nothing for me! Whatever, I am letting my temper get the best of me again. I shall write in this book to humour her, let her think she is doing something, I do not care. Perhaps this journal could be of use to me to keep track of my thoughts...and leads, and to keep my meddlesome cousin off of my back. Yes, this journal shall server my purposes quite nicely.<br/><br/> Anyways, my paladin training is rather boring again, as my struggle with the light has ended and it comes to me easily once again. Thank the light that is over. I have completed my basic training and am sent on endless quests in the filthy, plague infested...filth of the Ghostlands. I find our allies the Forsaken rather unsettling and I only endure this for my sister. My dearest little sister......<br/><br/> Light, give me strength, give her strength for I shall visit her soon and hopefully bring a cure for her with me. Hopefully....hopefully she will not be dead, for then I will have failed her just as I failed Salethorian.<br/><br/> <em>A single teardrop has stained the page, causing a small amount of the ink to run.</em><br/><br/> Nevermind, I must remain strong. Seem strong at least, for I am worth nothing to her weak.....but speaking of tedious tasks, I have found something that may be of use to me; A guild. A fellowship. I have joined the Rising Sun Fellowship and already they have proved quite interesting. A member seems to have been captured.<br/><br/> Of course I have no real wish to jump up and help them, this girl I heard over the guildstone should learn to take better care of her boyfriend; he seems to be of interest to someone. I heard little over the guildstone, but whatever, I care little of it. Although if I must, I shall help<br/><br/> Whatever, I only joined for some amusement, and perhaps to find any information on a cure for my sister. I may help them anyways just for some adventure and excitement. An escape from my worries. They've proven to be exciting already.<br/><br/> Oh, and I have taken up jewelcrafting. It's not nearly as.....deliciously arcane as enchanting but it proves rather complicated at times and the materials are everywhere. It gives me something to do when I'm bored...<br/><br/> .....Which is pretty much always.<br/><br/>~Lyrilia Dawnblade

Today was not as bad as yesterday, I didnt have to do as much killing and killing. I still did some, but today I fought what appeared to be Blackrock Orcs but in Terokkar, and some race I believe is called Broken. I also tried to find out what the potions Solorin's brother gave me do, he told me to only use them if what he thought was going to happen did, but that was of no help since he didnt tell me what that was. I suppose I'll have to try one some time, and find out. I also took a hit today... but it is nothing... just a small cut upon my chest from an Orc's dagger. I just hope that it wasn't a poisoned blade. I think I'll get some rest now, and wake Duknai Stonebow, an Orc hunter, my shift for guarding camp is over...

Oh, Light... Another loss... Another failure...<br/><br/>Another Light-damned moment of complete defeat. We lost the rune. We lost Cyaer. What in the world am I going to tell Mia? What am I going to tell the rest of the Fellowship? We failed. Aseria has both Cyaer and the rune. Only here, in my journal, can I write exactly how hopeless I feel. And what is the next rune? Desire. <br/><br/>This, I think I can do. This, I think we can succeed at. Light knows the Fellowship desires plenty here. From my desire to succeed, my desire to beat both Aseria and Viragona, my desire to set things to rights with Nic, to the Fellowship's desire to earn a name for ourselves, to our desire to make this world we live in safer, to the desire Nic and I share, if we ever reach that point again, for the world to be safe for our children, and the children of our children.<br/><br/>I think there is enough desire, desperation, in my people for the rune to snap free. But first... First we must find it. Tislina seems to think it is in Karazhan, and I suppose that is my next destination.<br/><br/>I want nothing more than to go after Aseria, and get Cy back, but I am not certain I am capable of that much, not right now, not with the burns I still have from Aseria, nor with the promise I made to Nic. <br/><br/>Speaking of Nic, the healers released him yesterday to the care of the Blood Knights in Silvermoon. I think I was included in that transfer. Apparently the burns and the hole in my shoulder needs to be dealt with more thoroughly.<br/><br/>But we are all alive... We think Cy is, at least, and the Fellowship endures... And Nic is home.<br/><br/>But what in the Light's name am I going to tell Mia?

<em>“So now you are awake, dearie. It is about time you came to.”<br/><br/>The brown haired woman’s vision slowly came into focus. She was in a room without windows and it had a single door. The floor was made of wood although she did not know if she were on a ground floor or upper story. She also had no idea as to where she was. Her eyes drooped down.<br/><br/>“No, you need to stay awake right now!” the Rose stomped forward and kicked the prone woman with her foot.<br/><br/>The woman with the brown hair groaned as the foot connected with her stomach. Slowly she opened her eyes and looked at the woman standing over her. A familiar woman… from Falconsky estate! She wanted to shout something, confront the woman but was physically unable to. Her fingers groped the area around her, coming into contact with her bag. Slowly, she dragged it forward and dug a hand in searching.<br/><br/>“Don’t think you will find any of your weapons there,” the Rose sneered. “I took the liberty of removing them.”<br/><br/>It wasn’t her weapons that she was after, but rather a stone. Her fingers brushed over it and she clumsily activated it. Exhausted, she laid her head back on the floor.<br/><br/>“Stay awake!” The Rose hissed. “I need you to cooperate.” She nudged the prone woman in the stomach with her shoe and was rewarded with a groan.<br/><br/>“Who…” the voice of the brown haired woman breathed out, her head was pounding, her mouth was dry and she was disoriented. “Where…”<br/><br/>“Ah, wondering who I am and where you are no doubt, no matter. I don’t intend to tell you. We all have our little secrets, hmmm?”<br/><br/>“Hurts…”<br/><br/>“Of course it does!” the Rose said sweetly. “I imagine that you are probably feeling as if a thousand hammers were pounding on your head. Which is why I need you awake. As much as I am enjoying seeing you writhe in pain, I cannot deliver you like this.”<br/><br/>“De…delive…” the woman with the brown hair could not get the words out. Her tongue refused to work.<br/><br/>“Why my dear, you have been bought and sold!” the Rose spoke sweetly. “Someone has paid a very, very high price to have you delivered. Who would have thought you to be so valuable, but I won’t question MY good fortune made off of you. Wonder what he wants with you?”<br/><br/>“Who…”<br/><br/>“You’ll know soon enough,” the Rose snapped. “Now, be a good girl and drink this.”<br/><br/>The woman with the brown hair choked and coughed as the liquid was poured down her throat.<br/><br/>“But I cannot keep you awake… you are simply too slippery to stay put,” the Rose advanced on her with a small dagger.<br/><br/>“What… are… you… doing?”<br/><br/>“Not scared, hmmm? I suppose they trained you well. Back to sleep my dear,” the Rose spoke in a sing-song voice. “When you wake again, you should be lucid enough for delivery.”<br/><br/>“To… who?”<br/><br/>The woman with the brown hair tried to pull back from the poisoned dirk. She knew full well what was on it, a sleeping serum that would knock her out for a short while. But she couldn’t stop the blonde woman from administering it. Her mind clouded and she slumped forward, her hand falling over the guild stone’s controls, inadvertently shutting it off.</em>

<em>A red journal...bound by a golden rope. A name is printed in gold on the front...Aseria Sunblade</em><br/><br/><em> Ash stood infront of the golden statue that was Cy. She and the Witch decided to use him as a decoration for the Manor while the Witch found a way to remove the spell with one of the runes she might have. For the mean time, he looked good next to the paintings.<br/><br/>Her journal was in her hand, tapping the feathery tip against her chin as she thought of what to write.

When I came to collect the Rune, Cy was there, and I had threatened him that I would melt the gold around him and incase his smoldering body in solid gold, and then keep him in our home as a trophy.<br/><br/>Well, that didn't exactly happen...<br/><br/>The rest of the Fellowship came. I probably couldn't stand a chance given the power that I had back then, and the voice of the Rune in my head. But thankfully, I wasn't the only one, the others were also effected and started to fight each other. I fought against Sol and Kel; Kel had gone to try and stop Cy and Sol stayed to try and beat me. Thanks to that rotting corpse of a man, I now have a scar near my right eye...<br/><br/><em> She paused, slowly raising her hand to the bandages that covered the wounds near her eye. Sighing, she continued to write</em><br/><br/>...No matter, though, I landed a deadly blow in his back. He would probably be healed, but I don't care, at least I got that bastard back. Then Kel came, I tried to fire bomb them all with a rune that I drew on the sand that casted a fury of fire balls....but Kel managed to put a sheild on all of them. Blast, she is growing stronger...but then again, it's something to look forward to when the time comes, and I can't wait for that!<br/><br/>I manage to burn her, and try to climb back up the statue, but then the paladin, Aran if I remember correctly, tried to stop me. Curse him, I really wish I had beaten the crap out of him before I left the Fellowship. Then something interesting happened....Cy fell down from the statue, turned into solid gold.<br/><br/>I leapt down to see what had turned him into a golden statue, it turns out it was the Rune! I made a portal back to Gilneus, and took Cy with me quickly before the others had the chance to recover. I heard some priest mention something about 'I don't know what I'm dealing with', and he is right, I don't....the Witch does though.<br/><br/>So, either way, Cy is kinda like my trophy now, which seems pretty great in my mind...but still, it still opens the problem of not being able to get the Rune, unless I want to become a statue myself, and I don't think the Witch will be happy about that.<br/><br/>However, back to the topic of Kel.<br/><br/>I remember her speaking to me through her mind. Something about me forceing her on Cy...the poor girl, she truely doesn't know what is going to happen to her. The next Rune they are going for is Desire, which you can say I have no 'desire' to go get, seeing as I already have Greed...but, Kel has some dirty little secrets in that mind of hers.<br/><br/>She may say that she will make things right with Nic, however, something tells me that is not true. When she was with Cy, the desire for him was great, huge, unquestionable! If she thinks she is going to get the next Rune with positive desires, like beating me, wanting to straighten things out with Nic, and what ever else she has in mind, I don't think it will. This is an evil Rune for and evil book we are talking about here, nothing soft and touche is gonna work that easily.<br/><br/>Anyway....I'm going to check on Lady Krystala's process. She must have found something by now!

<em>The woman with the brown hair slowly opened her eyes. The air smelled stale and dusty, but not foul. Perhaps they were keeping her in an abandoned building. A small shaft of light slipped into the otherwise dark room from under the closed door. With the dim light provided, she gazed around the small room where she was being kept and found nothing; no furnishings or wall hangings, nothing.<br/><br/>Judging from the color, she thought that it was daylight coming in through a window in the room just past the door. If it was daytime, she would not be moved. They would wait until darkness fell and use that to cover their activities.<br/><br/>The pounding in her head had been reduced to a dull ache and her limbs felt leaden. Her mouth was dry and it hurt to swallow. She had been bound while she was knocked out and a test of the bonds told her that whoever tied her up did a good job, it would take a while to get loose and the rough texture of the rope would ensure that her attempts to free herself would result in shredding her wrists.<br/><br/>Her bag was nowhere to be seen. The woman with the blonde hair had probably taken it with her when she left. Hopefully, it would be traded with her—the thought of losing the contents made her a little panicky as both the guild stone (the thing that would get her out of here) and her journal (which contained her life as she knew it) were in it.<br/><br/>She laid her head back on the floor, the effort to keep it up too exhaustive, and thought about what had gone wrong. How exactly had she ended up drugged and laying tied up on a floor?<br/><br/>She had gone to Silvermoon to have breakfast with Kel. Having spent two nights guarding the Rune of Greed and fighting it had proved to be exhaustive so a day away from the thing seemed in order. There were people set to guard it so she had planned to sleep in Silvermoon and return via zeppelin later that afternoon.<br/><br/>Only, she hadn’t had a chance to get much sleep. She was woken up shortly after noon and sent on a rescue endeavor in the Western Plaguelands. Only, there was no one there to be rescued. Perhaps the Crusade had stepped in first? From there, she went to the Undercity for something to eat and drink when someone—a cart vendor—had approached her.<br/><br/>The vendor poisoned her tea? She didn’t know, but the forsaken usually didn’t use cart vendors—that probably should have been her first clue, but she had been so tired from lack of sleep and fighting the rune that she hadn’t considered it odd. She remembered drinking the tea and everything went black.<br/><br/>The blonde woman said that she had been bought and sold, but to who? The woman with the brown hair struggled with her thoughts, the affects of the drugs used to knock her out taking their toll. Her stomach turned over at the thought of slave trade, but when the other woman referred to the buyer, it sounded as if it were a specific person. Who would want to buy her? Why would they want to buy her? Where were they taking her? Why her?<br/><br/>Her mind was racing and she forced herself to stop the train of thought. It probably an effect of the poisons used on her.<br/><br/>She hoped that there was someone listening last night when she activated the guild stone and really hoped that she had properly turned the thing on. She entertained a brief thought about Sol punching whoever had drugged her but then the thought turned dark.<br/><br/>He had no idea what happened to her. She had just disappeared without a word and she squeezed her eyes shut as she realized that he might very well think that she left him. If he did, how would he react? He had trusted her and she had told him that she wasn’t leaving… and now it would seem that she left him… and that would mean that she lied to him… and that would break his trust in her… and… and…<br/><br/>Her mind was churning again and she bit her lip to keep it from running away with what might be. She needed to think about a way to get out of this mess or at least get her bag back.<br/><br/>There was the soft sound of a boot hitting the floor outside the door. It swung open and a boney forsaken stood there with a small dirk in his hand. She could see sunlight filtering illuminating his form so there was a window nearby. Now, the question was how to get untied and out said window.<br/><br/>“Awake, I see,” he said in a rather raspy voice. He made a curious rattling noise as he moved towards her. “We are not yet ready to move you, so back out you go. Boss’s orders and all.”<br/><br/>“No…” she tried to squirm away but there was nowhere to go. A small prick on the wrist and soon her eyes were falling shut as darkness overcame her. “No…”<br/><br/>The forsaken watched as the woman went unconscious then checked her bonds before leaving and locking the door.</em>

<strong> <em>(An ornate scarlett leather tome with an intricate gold lock and clasp, and gold-edged pages. The name Lyrilia Dawnblade is inscribed on the bottom left corner of the cover, in a flowing, gold script.)</em></strong><br/><br/> <em>Lyrilia sat at an ornately carved desk, plain pieces of parchment were scattered across it and a red tome lay open to a fresh page. Blotts of ink were scattered across the table as she toyed with the quill in her hand, its white feather nearly blue with inky fingerprints. Dark ink stained her fingers and streaked her hair as she her hands through it. Her eyes were tired, and her bare feet sore from the endless running she had done the past few days. Picking up the tome she walked over to the bed, sitting down with the tome on her lap. Taking her quill in hand she pressed the tip to the paper and began writing.</em><br/><br/> The past few days have been rather tiring. The Fellowship has proven more exciting than I expected, and its issues more dangerous....<br/><br/> <em>The remaining ink ran out of the quill as it scratched across the page. Sighing, the paladin slid off the bed and walked over to the desk, her bare feet smacking against the cold stone floor. Leaning across the desk for the bottle of ink, a strand of her long blonde hair dragged through a large blotch. Cursing she searched her bags for a string, and pulled her hair up into a crude ponytail, making her way back to the bed.</em><br/><br/>Anyways, I attented a sort of meeting in Silvermoon City at a place the Fellowship considers their guild hall. I met a few of the newer members.....one of them I'm not sure I quite like but I shall return to that later. They told us of a Warlock,Viragona, who posesses a sort of evil tome that requires many runes to activate by opening the locks; a lock for each rune. This warlock appears to have already collected a few of these runes. They explained that if the tome were to be activated, all the locks unlocked, that terrible things could happen....<br/><br/> They also have another problem it seems. A rune, the rune of greed has been taken by a mage, an insane one at that, that had been a member of the Fellowship. Perhaps they should learn to keep a closer eye on their members, especially if they appear to be going insane. For I am sure there must have been signs of her sanity slipping away. Whatever....I think they weren't careful enough, but I most likely am alone in my thoughts as I often am. You'd think if you had an evil warlock watching your every move you would learn to be more cautious. As a result of this Rune being taken....Cyaer I believe his name was, has been turned into a statue. A statue of gold, which is quite befitting for a rune of....well...greed. I presume these runes to be very powerful, so perhaps this was another mistake on the fellowships part, of not nearly being careful enough.<br/><br/> Whatever, I do not know all the details so perhaps I should not be thinking such things of them. Oh well. I form opinions easily and speaking of such I have already formed some of my fellow guild members, including their...well our leader I suppose. The rogue informing me of such information on the warlock Viragona, and the Mage being Aseria I believe, has not left much of a good impression on me. I believe as I have not left such a good one on her. I co not know much of the guild rankings, and who is higher up than who, but I'm sure it was not in this, Jahara I think, well I'm sure it was not in her place to be saying that I do not know any better than to be speaking the way I was, and to be indirectly suggesting that I have problems. Just like my cousin. I also found her rather annoying, as I do my cousin, and shall wish to avoid her as much as possible.<br/><br/> Speaking of resemblences.....this one Death Knight, Alenthis, quite reminds me of two people actually, one more so than the other. He reminds me of...Salethorian, my dearest friend and a bit of my brother. I felt rather bad for insulting him after I did and for once apologized for doing something like that. My insulting him was the cause of Jahara's remarks...but it seems my insult was a tad bit unecessary but I shall never let that rogue know I think that. I know not of how she thinks of me but she shall quickly know she annoys me. Alenthis is alright for a Death Knight I suppose, we talked a little and I don't find any reason to think badly of him, but as I said of the forskaen, it is true for Death Knights as well; I find them all rather unsettling.<br/><br/>((1/2))

There are many things I do not understand about this Fellowship, and many conclusions I have drawn about them. For one, they aren't nearly as careful as they should be. Or so it seems. They appear to be taking some precautions as to not speaking of certain things via guildstones, for their enemys may posses one and be listening. I don't understand why they wouldn't take more precautions, or perhaps find other means of long-distance communication, but thats just me. Many people tend to not get me.<br/><br/> Oh and I nearly forgot. I have met the leader of this Fellowship, Kel'Tira. She explained to me why she was not there to explain the warlock and mage situation, and it was quite a valid reason. I have concluded her to be rather strong, for she explained that she had been tending to her husband's wounds as well as her own the day before, yet she stood there before me not looking weak. She appears to be fairly wise as well.....and I fully agree with one of the things she said, about putting her husband's needs ahead of the Fellowship's. I'd put finding a cure for my sisters illness above such a thing as the fellowship, as I have put it above many other important things. <br/><br/> I cannot fail her as I have failed so many before. I will not. The only thing to stop me is death, and I will fight to my last breath to bring health to one of the only family members I have left. I vowed to protect her,and protect her I shall as my studious cousin and Ignorant brother seem to care little of her. Too busy with house matters? With arcane studies? That is something I shall never do. I will never put work or others before my family. Especially a member who helped me so many times before.<br/><br/> Light, give her strength. Give me strength to do what I must. I shall head for the Hillsbrad Foothills tomorrow and continue my adventures....perhaps I shall find a lead among the forsaken...I heard they have highly skilled alchemists and Apothecaries.<br/><br/> What am I saying? I'm not even sure what is exactly threatening her life...who knows if an Apothecary would even be of help? Even a highly skilled one...<br/><br/>I must continue searching...Kel'Tira thought me troubled, and she has no I dea how right she is. Perhaps, if I find her trustworthy...I may confide in someone sooner than I thought. Maybe. I am not sure of much right now, but I do know this...<br/><br/>I must see my little sister soon...perhaps knowing how much longer I have left will push me harder than I push myself...perhaps....I will be of more use to her then...Stronger, I must be strong, stay strong, stronger than I can be...<br/><br/> ......For I am of no use weak.<br/><br/>~Lyrilia Dawnblade.<br/><br/>((2/2))

<em>The mind games of Cyaer Sunblaze -<br/><br/>The days pass slowly...and I am held on display for Aseria to look at as her trophy. How sad. I once respected her and felt love for her as a member of the Fellowship. And now she's lost it all, her mind, everything. They (there "they" are again) say that power corrupts, and I think Aseria is a prime example of that, I almost pity her...almost. <br/><br/>I think about the face rune, and I haven't felt an increase in those desires as I usually do...after several days, the desires get urgent, and any female is not safe around me...Mia understood that and we would meet, and the desires would slacken for awhile. But right now, I don't feel that urgency.<br/><br/>Again magic...the arcane, that which makes the world go round and round. I think I must be in some sort of stasis, almost frozen in time like. So how is it I can think, and ponder, and drive myself slowly insane with ambiguous questions? Filthy magic...I hate it. And who's the most powerful mage I know?<br/><br/>Is my Fellowship alright? Is my family alright? Is Karamia okay? What about...everything? I'm beginning to see how much I have come to care about all the people that I listen to everyday, day in and day out. And how I have taken them for granted, they will be there tomorrow...right? Right?<br/><br/>In retrospect, I'm not that nice of a person, I'm selfish, and very self-centered. Thinking only of Cyaer, what's in it for Cyaer? (See my own mind is turning against me.) Am I becoming a monster? Am I a monster now? Who am I? I mean really deep down, who am I??<br/><br/>I need to stop thinking, it hurts too much. My heart hurts too much.</em>

The statuette has been cast, and as we opened it I was very pleased. We were very careful in moving it. There is much to be done yet, cleaning the flash and piping, and hours of filing and buffing, and the final touches...but she is finished. My mentor smiled and slapped me on the back, and congratulated me on an excellent job. I cannot help smiling.<br/><br/>I hope Jahana likes it. You can see that she was the model for the statuette, and it turned out beautifully. Yes, she's in a rough condition right now, but I can almost see the finished piece of art, and I smile looking at her.<br/><br/>I wonder how Jahana is doing. I remember her saying she was getting to like being around me. And while it makes me blush, it also makes my heart beat a little faster. I'm finding her a remarkable woman of many surprises, but most of all I like her sense of fun. She makes me laugh, and want her more. I love to see her eyes dance as she prepares for some mischief...
