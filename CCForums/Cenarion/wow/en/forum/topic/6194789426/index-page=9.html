A coal black tome that glowed softly with a fel green taint. The magical locks would keep it from all but Viragona's eyes.<br/><br/>I cannot believe it. The simple curse I put on Cyaer has them all stumbling over themselves in lust and desire. They are almost ripe for my next trip to Karazhan. What I would give to have an opportunity to use the small snippet of Aranthil's soul to twist to my advantage.<br/><br/>He thinks he has won his way free, that the corruption is not harming him any longer. But it waits...it waits for my simple activation...to burst forth and consume him. I will do it if he tries to stop me. I will have the rune of Desire. Even if I have to subvert the pretty boy. Cyaer liked the taste of my lips, I could feel it. If I cannot get Kel'Tira to go any further...I am not afraid to use him.<br/><br/>I look at the insense my Forsaken friend has made me. Crafted of the flowers from the Slave pens, Sanguine Hibiscus. It has a delightful scent...it inspires boundless passion and desire. All I have to do is lure them in, send them on a search for the rune. I will tell them where it hides. But not directly. Perhaps I will send a messenger. Ah, yes...my death knight, Cynilestia.<br/><br/>She will plant the seeds of doubt and I will reap the rune. It will be as easy as my taking the Hatred rune. How simple it was to lure the resident dragons to the ritual area and incite them to violence. I turned the demons loose and they were fighting with the Dragons. The hatred coming from the Ogres was sufficient to make the rune drop. <br/><br/>Such a pity they all killed each other in their hatred. Not a soul left, they were tasty as well. My demons did good work. They were rewarded with much blood spilled. Their loyalty grows as does my army. I have a full contingent of ogres now. Even some warlocks gather round and bow to my power. Their demonic minions add to my force.<br/><br/>Listening to the guildstone of the Fellowship brought me much joy as I heard hearts breaking and trust shattered. I must plan the rune of Greed's activiation soon. Goblins are so easy to manipulate.

Mal'tar stabbed the dagger in hard. Yet he altered the path. Instead of delivering a killing blow he turned upwards and pierced Nicias' bicep. He screamed in pain as the sharp thin dagger went through and through his arm. Mal'tar smiled wickedly, he so enjoyed when they screamed. <br/><br/>"Woops, I slipped" He said in a sarcastic tone as he pulled out the dagger. Glared at him, his contempt for his brother clearly visible in his eyes. Mal'tar quickly pulled the dagger out and was only given a small grunt by Nicias. <br/>"Oh yes, one more thing brother. I need to tell Kel that you are dead and so I will need your ring." Mal'tar said while removing Nicias' right glove. As Mal'tar reached down to remove the ring Nicias spat at his face. It landed on Mal'tar's cheek. Mal'tar quickly wiped the spit off his cheek before smiling wickedly at his brother.<br/><br/>"Ah yes, quite right brother. You are in a hurry to die, so you won't be needing this." And at that Mal'tar took out his wicked dagger and sliced off Nicias' ring finger. Nicias grunted and clenched his fist. Mal'tar smiled and quickly pocketed the finger with the ring still on it. <br/><br/>"Well I would say it was nice to meet you, but you have been rather rude brother." He said smiling to Nicias. Nicias fell back onto the snow, feeling weak from blood loss. He began panting as well, his chest heaving.<br/><br/>"Well, you don't have much time to live brother do you. I am sorry, but now I must go finish of your !@#$% of a wife. Any thing you want me to tell her?"<br/><br/>"If...you touch....her....I will....KILL YOU!" Nicias roared.<br/><br/>"Well we will see about that," and while whistling a merry tune Mal'tar left.<br/><br/>The blood soaked into the snow. Nicias felt the darkness coming, He felt death creep closer and closer. He fought it off as long as he could, but he could not fight any longer. His eyes started to close and he grew tired. He saw a figure approach him as he went unconscious. <br/><br/>Grillick saw Nicias and made his way over as quickly as he could. Another warrior followed behind Grillick, Casania. Grillick was the first to reach Nicias. He stared at the wounds and immediately went to work. He took out his bandages and a healing potion and did his best. After about an hour he was finished. He looked over Nicias' now bandaged body. He just might make it. <br/><br/>Casania knelt next to Nicias and patted his head. She felt sorry for her squad leader. She had heard about what had happened from a friend and now this. He might not even live. She stared at him with her eyes, displaying something more than just devotion to her superior. <br/><br/>Grillick set up a small fire and they made camp. Later they would go and look for the main force, but right now they needed rest. They could navigate later. Grillick looked over at the man who was his leader and the man who had saved his life countless of times.<br/>"You cannot die Nicias, I will not allow it." Grillick whispered. Nicias did not hear these words. He still lay unconscious, with Casania stroking his hair.

I sought her out, and could not find her. Mia, where have you gone, my beloved?<br/><br/>I made a run to Dalaran to empty bags, refine some ore, and pack away some herbs I had picked. And I checked the mail. For the briefest of moments, my soul was crushed when I opened the envelope and the diamond ring I had given to Karamia slid out into my hand.<br/><br/>I read the letter with much trepidation, and felt the blood rush from my head. She was alright, but she wasn't. I mean she was alive and okay, but she had felt she was losing sight of herself, and her use of the Light. My hands were shaking as I read that she was setting me free, and that she was returning the ring as was not fair to me that she kept it.<br/><br/>It took many long deep breaths to find myself calm again, and to find my center, and reply to her. I returned the ring to her, saying she needed to know she was worthy of love. I have hope in our someday. I have hope in us. We would find our way back to each other.<br/><br/>Then I did something I hesitated to do, I went to Silvermoon City. I needed to pick something up that was only in that bank, a faded drawing from Kel'Tira, of my Karamia. I remember how many nights I looked at it, thinking of her, and asking the light to protect her.<br/><br/>I made a quick run to the Hall, and grabbed a few things, and an extra commstone. As I turned around, I was surprised to to see Lilli seated on a divan, reading. One thing lead to another, and I was soon pouring my heart out to her on what I had done, and in possibly losing Mia.<br/><br/>She suggested I contact Aranthil about something called a repentance. I could only hope this would bring me one step closer to Mia, and show her my heart was in right place, and willing to do anything to show her I stilled loved her.<br/><br/>Then the guildstone came alive. It was Mia and Kel. I would be lying if I said my pulse didn't race at the sound of Kel'Tira's voice, or that my heart broke at Mia's admission that she was hurting.<br/><br/>And then I heard the words that shook me to my very core. I had not only lead Mia to doubt her light, but Kel'Tira was seeking her light also. What had I done! I had lead two paladins way from the light! What was I becoming? Who am I? Aranthil, help me to correct my misdeeds, I repent, I repent!<br/><br/>Then Kel said she was coming to Silvermoon, and I had to leave quickly. The last thing I needed to get back to Mia was that I was there at the same time Kel was there. I picked up a few more items, and left for Dalaran.<br/><br/>I swear, sometimes I wonder what has became of me, have I been given the other side of the coin now?

I have mentioned that I worked to help pay for my way through the academy. What I did not mention was that some of the higher nobles' sons found it "entertaining" to jeer, jibe, and otherwise make my life a living hell as I worked and studied to make it. I never stooped to their level, nor did I acknowledge their humor. That changed today.<br/><br/>Last night, I ran into Jahana by the forges and anvils outside Blood Hall. And she had something she wanted to show me. I followed her to a place that was amazing. I was wandering around this studio, that had so much potential, when she asked if I liked it. I told her that the lighting was fantastic, and I could see so much that could be created here, and how there was a park just outside, and...she told me it was mine. I was stunned, then she said that my sponsor had obtained it for me.<br/><br/>We were in the shadows from where a workman was pounding on some boards, and she whispered 'Where's the Kissing Bandit?' I took her into my arms, and kissed her. And things escalated. When I awoke she was gone, but I felt so very good having seen her again.<br/><br/>It was in the lockers of the Hall this morning that the incident happened. I am not proud of what I did, but I would do it again in a heartbeat. A few of my "buddies" were there, as I cleaned out my own locker, and picked up the wet towels. When the chief instigator mentioned seeing me with a common street strumpet, and his friends were laughing uproariously, when he started to ask how many copper she cost, I hit him, I hit him so hard he flew away from me. And as I walked out of there, someone whispered that they thought I had broke his jaw. Serves him right.<br/><br/>I stood before my sergeant. He knew my history, and he had helped me find extra work to pay for books and such. But now he was furious. His main question he asked me was, 'What the Fel did you hit him with Neryth? You broke his flipping jaw!' He dismissed me when I told him I had only hit him with my bare fist.<br/><br/>My "punishment" was to work beside my smithing trainer, and create weapons for the students. For two weeks. Truly, this was no punishment for me. He only asked me once what had happened, I merely told him that my "buddy" had besmirched the honor of a lady firend I was escorting.<br/><br/>He will be in the infirmary for a week. His jaw wired up. Perhaps he will think twice before opening it again.

<em>The Dark Knight Gets up in the early hours of the morning, He looks to the sleeping Auxilia and smiles, He lays a kiss on her cheek and goes downstairs to wash the glasses they used for wine the night before, he puts on a good shirt and goes to the city.</em><br/><br/>I am feeling more and more complete as the days go by, I am happy with her, I am content, I could not have found a better person, She understands who I am on the inside and who I want to be, she has been where I have this is something that we share and something I believe to keep us close.<br/><br/>I had an interesting Night with her last night we drank wine she smuggled out of Elwynn and we shared the events of our day, As we spoke for a moment the conversation got a little serious, I did not mind, I do enjoy to speak with her. Maybe we can go out tonight, or perhaps I can show her my culinary poweress, and impress her slightly, who knows.<br/><br/>While working In Uldum yesterday I felt as if I was needed, I contacted Kel'tira threw the Guildstone, She was crying again...It was my job as a friend to go comfort her, We spoke and I allowed her to know a little more about my past...about..my wife...still I do not believe her husband to be dead, I asked her to take care of the runes, and I will speak to Auxi tonight about going to look for Nicias, It is all I can do for now, but it is something. <br/><br/>If there Is anything to be learned from what has happened in these past few days it is, Hold on to those you hold dear the ones you love, Do not slip up If you care about some one, If you love them, Hold them close and do not let go, Love is a beautiful thing, treat it delicately. People can learn from their mistakes but take it to heart that you should learn from them aswell.

Journal of Karamia Dawnstrike<br/><br/>Sand everywhere! In my boots, in my leggings and in my hair...I can almost taste it in my mouth. I am so sick of sand! It dulls my hair, chafes my skin and dulls my armor and weapons. I work hard all day trying to restore the balance in this conflict. I go from one contact to another. The days blur together with unceasing combat and ache in my bones. I hardly have time to think about anything but keeping myself alive and seeking the Light inside of me to stop the bleeding and heal the wounds.<br/><br/>The nights...are different. Cool breezes ruffle my hair as I gaze out into the desert. My perch in the balcony of the Inn where I stay gives me a panoramic view of the surrounding desert. Moonlight is bright and bathes the land in silver. I can hear the calls of nightbirds and the distant growl of the huge crocs in the river. The barking laugh of the hyenas calling to each other makes my skin crawl.<br/><br/>It is in the nighttime I suffer the most. Cyaer is far away in Silvermoon, or wherever Kel'Tira has sent him. Was I right in walking away from that? She needs him, she has far more responsibility than I do. She has a House to run and a husband who is missing. If he ever returns...or if he does not. I cannot keep Cy from helping her. He is part of her family. He has a responsibility as well. My heart aches with need at times, I miss his strong arms around me.<br/><br/>It is then I remember Aranthil's words and kneel to pray. I must rely on the Light, I must make it my priority. I must let it fill me with Joy and push out the hurt. <br/><br/>"Light give me Serenity to accept the things I cannot change, Courage to change the things I can and Wisdom to know the difference."<br/><br/>The warmth of the Light fills me and my heart grows full with Joy and Serenity. As I contemplate the wondrous feeling of peace inside of me, a stray thought filters in. Is this the way? Do I give up on loving anyone or anything other than the Light? Aranthil claims that celibacy will strengthen the Holy Paladin more than anything else. But is he true to that himself? I cannot help but wonder as I remember his reaction to my kiss. He seemed surprised, shaken even. It was only a small kiss to his cheek. I did not mean it for any other reason than gratitude for his help in setting me on this path.<br/><br/>My penance will soon be done, I have managed to help the curious cat people. I have yet to find others who are on a similar exercise. It is my Journey back to the Light. My willingness to set my feelings for Cyaer aside and go back to my roots. To get back the one thing that makes me strong and able to help the Fellowship in my own way.

I returned to Silvermoon City earlier then planned. I remember leaving after being with Tislina at our spot and kissing her as she left. Once I returned I looked for Tislina, I thought she would want to see me. I checked the guild Hall, and she was there. Kel and some mage was there. Kel seemed as if she just couldn't look at us, standing close together enjoying the others presence. Everyone left soon after my arrival. Nothing else happened that day besides that. The next day was very uneventful besides a session of training. Last night I was in the Hall and Tislina came in. She asked me how she looked, and I gave her the response that she looked beautiful as she always does. She told me that she had a hearing with a very important Archmage and that she wanted to make a good impression. After that she asked me if I had seen the new carnations in Fairbreeze. I nodded, and my mind was on flowers. I remembered the rose I got her while I was gone. I said I had something I've been meaning to give her, and took the rose out of the black pouch I had put it inside. I could tell that she liked it. Tislina also cast some sort of spell on it that will make it never wilt. She had to leave after that, but she hugged me before so. Thats all that has been happening, I have no more to write about.

<strong>Kel'tira Sunblaze<br/></strong><br/>He is alive. Light be praised, he is alive! <br/><br/>I should never have believed Mal'tar. Never believed he was dead. To be honest, though, I think I needed something to believe, seeing as nothing seemed to make sense to me. I needed something to believe.<br/><br/>All that matters is that he is alive. I would not blame him if he chooses to leave me. Would I die inside? Of course. Could I live? Not truly, but I could cling on to life just to keep the Fellowship alive.<br/><br/>The hardest thing for me is knowing that I did this to him. Knowing that I hurt him like I did is one of the hardest things for me to come to terms with. Knowing that I did this to him, that I made him run off to Northrend, it hurts. A lot.<br/><br/>And now, sitting here by his bed as I have for hours, it hurts still more knowing that I might never get to hold him again. That I might never have another chance to call him 'husband'.<br/><br/>If that is the case, Light give me strength...<br/><br/>Kneeling over him in the streets of Dalaran, watching his blood pool on the stones, something broke within me. I have no words for what I feel, no words for what I think. The empty chasm that was once my faith is filled again, for the Light returned to me in my moment of desperation.<br/><br/>But it is not the same, I fear. It is not the warmth of life and love, but the harsh reality of the world, and that my fight against the darkness is, ultimately, a losing battle. And yet, I press onwards, as I always have, and always will.<br/><br/><em>Kel sits for a moment, staring at the still form of Nicias, the man she will always think of as her husband, and begins to write slowly again, the tears she has held back for so long starting to finally fall.</em><br/><br/>He was leaning on the wall, panting, almost, when I arrived, “Nic...”<br/><br/>When he looked up, just watching me, there was something in his eyes, something I could not identify, and I repeated myself twice, and took a step closer before he said anything, “I am sorry Kel but I need to go, my comrades need me."<br/><br/>I could not bear hearing that, "No."<br/><br/>He was limping forward, and I could see how much it hurt him, "Please do not try and stop me Kel."<br/><br/>“Look at me,” I said, placing a hand on his shoulder only to have him fall, wiping blood from his mouth as he looked up, “You cannot go anywhere in this condition,” I admit, I stumbled over the last word, “love.”<br/><br/>“I must, I will NOT abandon someone. She is trapped”<br/><br/>“Nic... What happened...?”<br/><br/>“In ice! She does not have much longer!”<br/><br/>Frowning, I asked him where, his response, through coughs, and shaking as he rose slowly to his feet, “Somewhere in Dragonblight.”<br/><br/>I wrapped an arm around him to help him back inside as I spoke, "You need to get back inside, come on."<br/><br/>It hurt to have him push me away. It hurt.<br/><br/>“Kel, I will not let you stop me.”<br/><br/>“Nicias Su- Sunblaze. Stay here. I will go find her, Light or no.”<br/><br/>Shaking his head, he denied it, “No, you have less a chance than me.”<br/><br/>“No! Look at me, Nicias! I will not let you.”<br/><br/>I am not sure what I saw in his eyes when he glared at me, "Kel, I WILL go look for my comrade."<br/><br/>“And what good will you do her if you get out there and collapse?”<br/><br/>He was ignoring me as he pulled out his whistled and blew, summoning his wind rider, “At least I will have tried!”<br/><br/>I rubbed my eyes, “Nic...”<br/><br/>“If you care for me still, wait here.”<br/><br/>“Mal'tar was right, you hate me, do you not?”<br/><br/>His next words hurt even more, “What are you talking about? Kel, I loved you, and still do, but you broke my heart in two.” Lifting off the ground, he spoke again, “I will be back soon.”<br/><br/>I shrugged helplessly, struggling desperately to hold the tears I wanted so desperately to release back, "You think I don't know that? I hate myself for it. I hate myself to the point that the Light has left me. Nic, wait.”<br/><br/>“Why should I wait?”<br/><br/>“Come back down here for a moment.”<br/><br/>Coughing and sighing, he complied, and I was again forced to hide the concern, the pity, I felt for him. The self-contempt that I forced this on him, “Please,” I said, “Because I can't stand to lose you a second time, and I have something of yours.” Rummaging in my pack, I produced the brown bag Mal'tar had given me, containing Nic's finger and wedding band, “Your brother gave this to me, after calling me a w|hore." He looked down at the bag, and I prompted him, “Take it, Nic. It's yours.”<br/><br/>((1/2))

He opened the bag, a strange look on his face, “Wouldn't it be rotted?”<br/><br/>“It is frozen, courtesy of a mage.”<br/><br/>“Oh...Well um thank you...<br/><br/>He tried to fly away then but something was wrong, "Nic..." I could see the blood seeping through his bandages, and he fell, and I could not catch him before he hit the ground. Something was terribly wrong. I could see his blood pooling under his body, and that scared me, and I did what I had to do. I rested my hands on his wounds, breathing a curse, and then calling his name, his speech incomprehensible from the blood in his throat.<br/><br/>I could not pray aloud, but I did pray. For the first time since he left me for this forsaken continent, I prayed. Asking forgiveness, asking for his healing. I felt so hopeless, so lost, at the possibility that he was dying under my hands, and I could do nothing to save the man I loved, and still love. I screamed, I cried out his name, and then the Light lit me up from within.<br/><br/>It was as if my soul was flayed, left to lay bare before me. I could see where I had failed, and what I could have done better. I could see how I should have acted, what I should have done. Why I did the things I did was suddenly clear. I was selfish, and when I tried not to be, I blamed myself for someone else's mistakes. I shouldered more than I could carry, and I fell. I fell into temptation, I fell. I wanted comfort, and Cyaer had been there for me while Nic was not, and I turned to him. I should never have even let myself think the way I did.<br/><br/>I should never have let him kiss me, I should never have kissed him back. I should have had the damned strength to tell the right from the wrong. I can only hope Nicias will let me set things right...<br/><br/>I could feel the Light burn a path through me, and into his broken body. I could feel it chiding me, while healing his body, and my spirit.<br/><br/>It took two of us, a healer and I, to carry him inside, and I have been sitting here by his bed ever since, trying so hard to put myself where he is.<br/><br/>((2/2))

Diary of a Priest- Sydric Silverhawk<br/><br/>(The pages are filled with anecdotes and prayers, as if Syd were searching for his own inner peace)<br/><br/>I have found something today which both startles and amazes me. I found a referrence to a Tome that I must seek out. Something about the wording in the referrence...I think it has some significance to the current guild troubles. It is a book of runes and their meanings. It may take me awhile to find it.<br/><br/>Perhaps my contacts in Booty Bay can help. They have often found Tomes I thought were lost to the Ages. I have been told we have a new Fellowship member who is a goblin. I will meet with him and see what can be arranged.<br/><br/>The Tome I need to find is called, Tome of Runes. It is a complete listing of all runes and their meanings. I believe it will help us to defeat Viragona. If we can counteract her runes and seal the book back up...

It's the anguish of not knowing if after she has returned to her first love, the Light, that pains me. I am prepared for the worst of not having her in my life as my precious and beloved, and I hang onto a hope that she will accept me as I am and we can start a new. I don't want to do it through a letter, I need to see her face to face, to see her response in her eyes, and to know it in both of our hearts.<br/><br/>A part of me is grateful to Karamia for so very much of what we have in our relationship. She showed me that I am worthy of love, and to be loved deeply. Before her, I had only dalliances with temple and bargirls. I cannot go back to that way of "love". I know now that love is not something to be taken for granted, and is worth holding onto with every ounce of your fiber. It truly is a precious and fragile thing. I learned that from Karamia.<br/><br/>Those proverbial "they" say that it is better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all. And I completely agree with them. Right now, I'm hurting, and in time I'll heal. But I am a better man, and a better everything loving Karamia. It has brought out the best in me, and I cannot thank Mia enough for taking a chance on loving me.<br/><br/>I can only hope she would be able to say the same thing. If not, perhaps I am a failure as a lover. Maybe I didn't say it enough, maybe I didn't show it enough...maybe I shouldn't have forgotten.<br/><br/><em>There is more written, but the ink has run, and is unreadable.</em>

I have begun a major project that I believe Sydric, my sponsor will be surprised and hopefully happy with the results. I am stepping out of my comfort zone of sketching, and attempting to create a bronze statuette. It will be a new medium for me, but I feel confident in creating a true work of art. May the light be with me.<br/><br/>I took this idea to my blacksmithing mentor, and he is willing to assist me in my endeavor. I will go to seek the ore I will need, and we shall smelt it for the statue. I'm am excited in trying this. We shall see how it works out.<br/><br/>Jahana has been missing for a few days. Probably on some sort of mission out in Outland. I will be tethered here in Silvermoon City for at least another week for my punishment.<br/><br/>I went to see him in the infirmary. I could see the fear in his eyes as I walked in, but I explained that I came to apologize for causing him the distress, and that I hoped it would not be needed to exercise such extreme measures in the future. While it hurt him to do so, he nodded quickly that it would not be necessary. I shook his hand and left. Did I see relief in his eyes?<br/><br/>The new loft is wonderful. I am enjoying having my own place, and not being in a barracks. I wonder how much Sydric pays for rent here? I hope I can be the artist he believes me to be. It does feel good to have someone that supports my "hobby".

"What the hell do you mean, 'I'm required in the throne room?!'"<br/><br/>The small undead shook his head again at Alenthis. "The Dark Lady commands it sir..."<br/>Alenthis froze. His mind raced as he tried to figure a reason that Sylvanas Windrunner herself, would have need of him. He had only seen her once or twice in his entire life...He wasn't a magnificent warrior. He hadn't done anything wrong to his knowledge...He swallowed slightly.<br/><br/>"Lead the way, then," Alenthis spat. Although he knew the smaller Forsaken feared him, he couldn't help but wonder if the man was finding some kind of sick pleasure in the summoning. When people were called to the throne room of the Undercity by the Dark Lady herself...they usually ended up in pieces. Alenthis swallowed again and fidgeted with his gloves as he followed the courier deeper and deeper into the royal quarter.<br/><br/>He approached the Royal Dais and stepped up onto the platform. Sylvanas stood there, watching him. Her advisor in life, Sharlinda, now hovered beside her, an advisor in death as well. <br/><br/>Sylvanas beckoned to Alenthis with her finger to come closer. Alenthis took a deep breath and walked forward. Step by step by step. He was sure he was taking the last step he ever would. He came to a stop in front of her and deeply bowed before her. He raised up and after clearing his throat spoke. "M'lady. You called for me?"<br/><br/>Sylvanas' eyes flickered briefly. "I did. I have a task for you."<br/><br/>Alenthis stared in disbelief. He stammered, "A task? Fro-from the Dark Lady?"<br/><br/>Sylvanas' mouth turned up on either side and after a moment, Alenthis realized she was slightly smiling. She motioned to Sharlindra and began to speak. "Alenthis, we have more in common than you think." Sharlindra handed her a file and she began to flip through it page by page. "You too were killed in Arthas' onslaught against the proud High Elves. You too were raised as a soldier and forced to kill your family, friends, and people by the monster Arthas." She shuddered for a brief moment. "But Arthas is no more. And our people can no longer ignore the other races of this world. I helped bring the Blood Elves into this Horde for a reason. We set up outposts, and assisted them in taking back their lands but now we need to take a next step. With your tighes and elven appearance you will make an excellent emissary to one of their organizations. I've chosen a smaller group. It's goals are returning glory to the Sin' dorei. A fitting goal." She handed Alenthis a map with a name written on it. "Now go."<br/><br/>Alenthis grasped the map and bowed. "It shall be done m'lady."<br/><br/>And so Alenthis stood at the gate of Silvermoon City with a map and a scrap of paper with three words written on them: Rising Sun Fellowship. Alenthis sighed and began walking....

Journal of Karamia Dawnstrike<br/><br/>What a glorious thing to have happen...my dreams of Cyaer, and how much I missed him...suddenly I feel warm lips pressed gently to mine. I was deep in my dream, remembering how good it felt to have his sweet lips on mine. I awoke startled to find someone bending over me. In shock I reached out in half asleep fogginess. "Cyaer?"<br/><br/>It was so amazing and wonderful! He was really there! All I could do was stare at him for a few moments, then the other memories came flooding back. He had betrayed me...he had been with someone else. But he begged me to listen to him. The pain in his eyes was very plain.<br/><br/>I listened to him with rapt attention. A curse? That made sense, considering who we were dealing with. And to think that now thanks to Sydric and Tislinna, we may have a way to counteract this foul warlock. Viragona, you will pay for this...one way or another.<br/><br/>We spent the better part of the evening discussing the meeting that Sydric had called. The details and the need to hunt for good runes made sense. I forgave Cyaer his transgressions. I wanted to so badly, I grasp at any excuse to have him back in my arms. Am I a fool? Will he do it again? He swears not...I pray he never does...if he strays again I will not survive it.<br/><br/>One last thing, we set a date for the wedding. I will be his wife and he will be my husband. I pray to the Light this will keep us stronger, knowing what almost happened.

<em>A woman lay sleeping on a bed, covered by a blanket. The hearth was nearly cold, the fires banked several hours ago. The soft light of dawn was creeping slowly towards the horizon, the ever increasing light pushing away the darkness.<br/><br/>The woman stirred restlessly, her face twisting into an unhappy expression. Suddenly, she bolted up from the bed with a small cry. Her heart racing and her hands trembling, eyes wide and fearful as she struggled to breathe.<br/><br/>“Not real, not real!” she murmured anxiously as she pushed the brown hair from her face.<br/><br/>She looked around the room as she scrambled out of the bed, fighting the urge to flee and forced herself to be rational. She turned in a circle her hands over her mouth as she bit down on her lip trying to gain control over the terror that had filled her. Finally, she began to calm down, her breathing slowed and she was able to think lucidly.<br/><br/>***<br/>(New entry in a plain brown leather journal.)</em><br/><br/>The nightmare came back. It had been quite some time since I have had one, but not long after Sol and I returned from Northrend, it came again.<br/><br/>This time, I was walking through Dragonblight looking for Nicias. I found him cold and frozen, his hands missing and his face a twisted wreck from where someone had mutilated it with a dagger. As I knelt down beside him, he rose up on his elbows and glared at me.<br/><br/>“Why did you do it?” he demanded.<br/><br/>I told him that I didn’t know what he was talking about and that I was here to rescue him. He merely stood up and gestured to his mutilated body and sneered, “Some rescue this turned out to be.”<br/><br/>When I asked him what happened, he replied, “You did this to me. See? The dagger is still in your hand. That is my blood dripping from it. It was all YOUR fault!”<br/><br/>I looked down and he had spoken the truth. My held a blood covered dagger and there was blood on my armor. I staggered backwards, away from him and he just laughed and pushed me down. Instead of falling into the snow, I tumbled backwards into a deep chasm his harsh laughter following me as I fell. Then, as always, I woke up.<br/><br/>Sol was already gone and in a way I am glad that he didn’t have to witness what went on. Sydric had mentioned that a lot of strange behaviors within the Fellowship are coming from the runes but everything he mentioned is a compulsion. These dreams are not about unwitting compulsion but something terrible that I did and nothing but blackness waiting for me.

Yesterday was probably the busiest, most hectic, and most intersesting day I've had since the Winter's Vale party last year.<br/><br/>It started off pretty normal. I got up, got dressed, and went down stairs for breakfest. After I had eaten I had to report to the trainig fields because the archmage I had met with the other night thought it would be good if I learned to fight with a sword. How did my first lesson go? Not so good. My instructor is a man about my age named Camberon. I was assigned to one so young because appaerntly he is very good with a sword. Good at patience? Not so much. I have only ever used daggers and mainly staves, but he expects me to get it right the first time. I fumbled a lot with it and even dropped it a few times. At one point I lost my grip on the hilt, sending it spiraling at the poor Ranger who was practicing with his bow next to me, almost taking his head off. And Camberon yelled at me the whole time! I must have apologized at least a dozen times to the Ranger, he just laughed and said it was fine. After that I spent about another hour hacking away at one of the training dummies, until Camberon flat out told me how bad I was, and sent me away telling me the lesson was over for the day. I wandered inot the Royal Exchange and collapsed, exhausted onto a bench.<br/><br/>When I had finished resting, I stood up intending to go to the library when a death knight came up to me and stated how happy he was to see someone living. As it turns out he wanted to join us. He told me his name was Alenthis and that he had come from Undercity to establish ties with us. He was very polite and kind. I showed him the Hall and we spoke for a little while, before he had to depart to contact the Undercity. I have no prejudice against him whatsoever. As a death knight he was worried how we would view him. I judge people by <span class="underline">there</span> actions, not the actions of someone like them. I look forward to working with him in the future. So ,I did get to go to the library. I didn't get to read though. Someone thought it would be funny to let a wind spirit loose and you can guess how that went. I was halfway through the fight when I got Sydric's summons.<br/><br/>I was the first to arrive in the Hall. Sydric and I spoke for a little while, as we waited for the others. I was in the middle of a conversation with him, when I felt something wet touch my hand. I turned around, but there was noting there. It happened again when Kel, Cyaer, and Auxilia showd up. Anyways, Sydric found a tome. Not just any tome though, an index of runes. This tome could be the key to counteracting ans maybe even stopping Vira. We <span class="underline">must</span> get it. Only one problem: it is in the possesion of a dranei in Stormwind. Sydric has hired AAMS to help us get it peacefully. We also divided into teams. Kel, Auxilia, and Solorin will go to Booty Bay and guard the rune of Greed. Cyaer, Sydric and I have been tasked with retrieving the runes to counteract Vira's. I exscused myself not long after for I still had to beat the wind spirit. After cleaning up the library, I went home and got changed into my dress robes because I had a meeting to attend. It lasted for about an hour and afterwards I was looking forward to getting some rest, but one of the instructors asked me to take a slip of parchment to one of the offices in Farstriders Square. Of course I agreed.<br/><br/>I located the office and entered. I left the slip of parchment on one of the tables and turned to leave, when a voice asked why I had come. And then I again felt something touch my hand. I couldn't help but giggle and I explained I was making a delivery. That's when he appeared. As it turns out the thing licking my hand was a fox named McCloud. I was told it was strange he liked me because usually he was only nice to his master. The man intorduced himself as Xalandir Sunsorrow, Solorin's brother. I told him a little about myself, in the hopes that i could get him to open up a little. He seems to keep to himself. He told me he had had a sister who was a mage, but she passed a few years ago. I told him I was vey sorry to hear that, and to my suprise, I told him I knew how it felt to lose a family member. This suprised me because I mentioned my past, and now matter how little, I had opened up to him slightly. He mentioned to me he was an assasin for hire. I was in a pretty good mood, and then he handed me the paper. He seemed to remember something and he had handed to me a piece of paper with Kreindis's name on it. I knew what it was, but I still had to ask. he informed me it was a kill contract, and that his clients filled them out and left them on his desk so he didn't have to meet them face to face. I felt like I was gonna faint. He said he didn't know who wanted Krei dead, but the handwriting looked like an orc's. He said since I seemed like a good person, and because McCloud liked me, he would do me a facor and not kill Krei. Which was really good to hear.

I told him he was a good person, but he denied it saying he killed innocent people all the time. But I believe he is a good person. He told me one day he might see that side of himself. Then he dissapeared on me. I looked around and called out but got no awnser. Then a brown orc walked in. When he saw me he seemed startled. I thought he might have been injured, so I asked if everything was alright. He stammerd and apologized for my loss. That's when I got suspicious. I asked what he was talking about, and he asked if something had happened to my 'hubby'. I informed him I wasn't married and that me beloved was fine. I was starting to think about charring him. Then he cursed someone and said he had to leave. Before he could though, Xal shot and killed him. He informed me the orc was called Grey'lok and was a crime boss who hung around Undercity. He told me not to worry about the mess because he had ways of cleaning up. Then he called what I think was a warpstalker and told me I may want to step outside. So when we both out in the fresh air, I asked why he shot the orc. He told me for two reasons. The first being because the orc would tell he failed to kill a target, which he never did. The second being because the orc would have killed me and Krei. I thanked him for saving my life and told him he was a good person. And he actually agreed. I won't tell anyone about our conversation. He had to leave soon after, but he asked if we could call each other friends. I gladly agreed. Then he disapperead again. And I went home smiling because I could call someone else my friend.<br/><br/>(2/2)

I found out earlier today that I am being sent to Terokkar Forest. I am not happy about that... Today I also was put into the group that will be taking shifts guarding the Rune of Greed near Booty Bay. I let Solorin and Auxilia take first shift. I went to Hardwrench Hideaway and let the couple be alone. There was another party going on there, as there is alot of times. Tislina came there when I was at the docks and I told her about me being sent to Terokkar. She also told me that somebody had a contract out to kill me and that if it wasnt for Solorin's brother, me and her would be dead... Tislina and I also went from the docks to the party, but before we did I said, "One more thing since I might not get another chance before I leave..." I closed the gap between us with one quick step and stood close to her. She looked up at me, and I kissed her, and she kissed me back. We went to the party and I saw Solorin's brother. He seemed as if he liked a woman there that looked alot like Tislina. I think Tislina helped him with her. I had to leave then. She hugged me as I left. Now, I have a long journey ahead of me tomorrow, and I'm going to get rest for it.

<em>Kreindis sits in the Worlds End Tavern in Shattrath City, sipping Eversong Wine. He slowly pulls his journal out and begins to write on a fresh page.</em> <br/> <br/><br/><strong>Kreindis Blazestride</strong><br/><br/>Today I left to Terokkar Forest. I met with a few members of the Fellowship before so, though. I ran into Karamia and Kel'Tira in Orgrimmar, though I didnt talk to them as they seemed to be talking about something that was meant only for eachother to hear. I saw Kel again later at the hall, and Auxilia was there too. We had tea and honeymint scones as some breakfest, and it was good. We all split up after a while, and I found Tislina not long after. I stayed with her for a while, and an Orc came in telling me it was time for me to go to Terokkar. I asked him for a minute, and said I would meet him outside. I turned back to Tislina, and asked her if she remembered how I said I might not get another chance yesterday at Booty Bay. She said she did, and I said that I think I just did. She smiled, and moved closer to me and leaned up, kissing me. I kissed her back. She slowly pulled away from me after a little, and told me to not do anything stupid. I told her I wouldnt, and I also promised I would come back safe. I left her there at the Silvermoon Inn then, riding with the Orc to Terokkar.<br/><br/>The day has been bloody, here. I must have killed hundreds of Firewing Sin'Dorei, a hundred more Arakkoa... And I'll be stuck doing it for the rest of the week... I can only hope that I can survive to see Tislina again..... I already miss her... <br/><br/> <em>Kreindis sighs, closing his journal and placing it back into his pack, sipping his Eversong Wine once more.</em>

Diary of a Priest-Sydric Silverhawk<br/><br/>Today I met with two very interesting goblins from AAMS. I had to chuckle at their fear and uneasiness around the mana Crystals in the Fellowship Hall. They were constantly giving it wary glances and claiming the eyes were following them. This despite my assurances that everything was under control.<br/><br/>They did however bring excellent news. My search for the Tome of Runes was successful! The scribe and fellow book collector in Stormwind has agreed to let me borrow her Tome to copy it. I was esctatic, until I realised the amount of work I would need to do to gather the herbs and make inks and then laboriously copy a huge Tome that size. My work is cut out for me!<br/><br/>The value of the Tome is such that I had to give her some assurance I would return it. Therefore I sent the goblins back to her with a book I had in my possession that she no doubt would never have access to. It is a compendium of computations that deals with mana usage and elemental energy. It is a highly technical book that I was able to find in my searches of the archives of the Highborn in some ruins located in Aszhara. I assured the goblins she would no doubt be as thrilled to copy it as I am to copy the Tome of Runes.<br/><br/>I await her reply and the Tome with eagerness. This will be a very valuable tool to use against the evil warlock Viragona. Now I must set my Fellowship members to aid me when they can gathering herbs. I will need so much ink!
