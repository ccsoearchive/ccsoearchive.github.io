<em> <strong>An ornate scarlett leather tome with an intricate gold lock and clasp, and gold-edged pages. The name Lyrilia Dawnblade is inscribed on the bottom left corner of the cover, in a flowing, gold script.</strong></em><br/><br/>This warrior thing is harder than I thought. There is much training, and it is hard work. Every muscle in my body aches at the end of the day, the strength required is astounding. Nevermind, I shall do it. I can do it and I will. It is strange without the light, but I am sure it has forgotten me, so I shall forget it. I am confident in this path of the warrior, it suits me quite well. I spoke with my cousin only to come into contact with the trainer she found me. I wish not to speak with her for anything else, and I shall avoid her if I can, despite any gifts she brings me. I will never forgive her.....at least I don't want to...Whatever. I have more important things to write about. I have finally brought myself to read my sister's letter to me...<br/><br/> <em>A tear-stained letter lays open in the book, pressed between its pages.<br/><br/>Lyri,<br/><br/>I know I have fallen ill, very ill and I do not know of what. I suppose you don't know either but it is scaring me, so I have written this for you incase I die. So if you are reading this, I must be dead then. I'm so sorry for dying, you know I was never very strong. Light, this feels weird to write! But if you do know what has killed me, I wish for you to let it be and please don't seek vengeance on whatever it is. I'm assuming you haven't changed much, Ly! On that note, I hope you aren't <span class="underline">still</span> mourning over Salethorian. I know he was special, but its not your fault, Ly. You two knew each other for as long as you can remember, and I understand its hard but please don't dwell on it any longer! As for me, let it go Lyri. I'm not suffering anymore.<br/><br/>Light be with you, dearest sister!<br/>~Evelise Dawnblade </em><br/><br/>Little does she know Salethorian has been far from my mind for some time now....I will try my best to do as she has asked, and I shall do that by throwing myself into my warrior training. I picked up a new guildstone when I spoke with Alenthis' brother-in-law. I shall keep it on me to be informed, but too much talk of Alen....<br/><br/>and it may find itself at the bottom of a lake as well....I wish to forget, and wrap myself in my training.... not hear more of what I already think about all the time...<br/><br/>I wish to forget...to push these unwanted feelings away.....I must forget....he is gone now...there is nothing I can do about it...Sol took him from me, and my cousin took my sister...must people always be taking things away from me? The things I love? I need to forget them......Alen.....Evelise...<br/><br/>I must forget.<br/><br/>~Lyrilia Dawnblade<br/><br/> <em> Traces of bloodthistle are found pressed between the pages, as if they fell in the book and were not brushed away, hinting at a possible addiction starting?</em>

<strong>Kreindis Blazestride</strong><br/><br/>I made it back to Silvermoon City from Northrend. I was happy that Tislina was one of the first people I saw when I did so. We talked for a little while in Silvermoon and I got to see her new pet, an Onyxian Whelpling named Amethyst. She said that it was different from the rest of them. So far it has seemed nice, it seems to like her alot. I also showed her the rune that my brother had burned on to me.<br/><br/> Soon later we went to the pond near Farstriders Retreat and talked for a while again. She asked what we were to do about my brother, and I said I was not sure. I also told her about the wards he had, where he cast a wall of shadow to block my attack. We discussed what we might do to get through it, before I said that we probably couldnt decide on much now though, since we dont have much information about them. She suddenly got angry. A ball of flame began to form in her hand. I tried to calm her, but it didnt work too well for a while. It hurt to have her angry with me. Somehow she got the idea that we should do something at her brothers grave, where her old house used to be. She lit something on fire that made the air smell like vanilla. It seemed to help her. She had to leave to go feed Amethyst, but I kept her there for a moment. I took a step forward and kissed her, and she kissed me back. She broke away after a while, and left back for Silvermoon. I headed back, too. <br/><br/>Nothing else really has been going on. I'm done with writing for now.

Just when I thought it wasn't possible, my life became even more interesting. Kreindis came back from Northrend and I was so happy to see he was okay. However, come to find out Keyadrion attacked him and burned a rune onto his chest. So now Keyadrion is in Krei's head and may or may not be able to control him for short periods of time. On a lighter note I showed him Amethyst. He told me to be careful with her. So, Krei and I ended up going to the pond by Farstrider's Retreat. I don't know why, but I became upset. Okay, maybe I do know why. The fear, the uncertinay, the feeling that I can't do anything. I cant stand those feelings. I felt bad though. I wasn't upset with Krei, just our current situation. But I could tell I hurt him anyway and I really didn't like that. We decided I should get rid of my anger somehow, and this voice in the back of my mind told me I should burn an inscens at Tavarus's grave. So we went to where he was buried, and I burned one that smelled like vanilla. I love the scent of vanilla and so did he. After that I took Amethyst home to feed her.<br/><br/>I went to our spot yesterday looking for Krei. I realized that with everything that had happened, I had neglected to ask how his trip was. Sure enough, I found him up there. We talked for a long time about his trip, but it got late. He asked if I wanted to sleep out there, but I declined because Amethyst needed food. So we just went back to my room in Silvermoon. He fell asleep pretty quickly, but no matter how hard I tried sleep would not come. I left him sleeping there and decided to go and talk with Xalandir. I found him outside he office talking with a women about finding a good home for an injured with pup. I showed him Amethyst and he showed me his new dragonhawk. Then we went inside. Strange as it may sound, I asked him if he had known my brother. He had. In fact there had been a kill contract. But Xalandir said he hesitated and that he wasn't going to do it. And you know what? I believe him. He wouldn't lie to me? I'm sure of that. He ended up throwing the contract in a fire, so now it's in the past.<br/><br/>He asked how Krei was so I told him the whole story about our predicament. He was worried and wanted to keep a closer eye on me. So, he gave me a beautiful purple ring. He explained how it had belonged to his sister, and that the three siblings had developed them as a way to stay connected. I was a little hesitant about taking it, but Xal insisted. If I want to talk to him, I tap it once. If I'm in trouble, I tap it twice. Anyways, shortly after we said our goodbyes. He wanted to go home to see if the girl he liked was there. I sure hope she was.

I'm not quite sure why they asked me to journal my exploits and journeys but here we are. I am Zyaer, a young Sin'dorei paladin fresh from the training field and anxious to bring glory to our nation once again. I am the third son of a minor noble, but I prefer to stand on my own merit, not that of my house, <br/><br/>I am a new raw recruit to a guild that goes by the name of the Rising Sun Fellowship. My cousin Raviel said this is the one we want to be a part of as it seeks to bring the Sin'dorei to its former status. We went to the Hall they used but no one was there, and one of the guards sent us to the Blood Knight infirmary, saying that the someone of some import was recuperating. We rushed over there, and introduced ourselves to the guild mistress, Kel'tira Sunblaze. She looked beat, and weary, yet she interviewed Ravi and me, and stood proudly for the most part.<br/><br/>I found her inspiring. And I look forward to presenting my shield and weapon to guard the members of the Fellowship in any manner that I can. I have vowed to uphold the Fellowship's tenets, and be a good example of the light, the Blood Knights, and my fellowship.<br/><br/>I have been working hard to preserve our people by doing small quests and odd jobs that aid my fellow Sin'dorei. I will soon be finding myself traipsing to the Ghostlands, and fighting the Scourge. I bear my shield and weapon up for bringing safety and preservation to our lands. <br/><br/><strong>I am Zyaer, a paladin of the Blood Knights, and loyal member to the Rising Sun Fellowship. I wear their tabard proudly, and seek to show them I will be a valiant and valuable holy warrior of the Fellowship. This I have vowed!</strong>

<strong>Tyrael</strong><br/><br/>The hunt continues, I find myself looking now in Northrend for a short while but here only lies the corpses of the dead and the damned. Whatever war was here is now long gone, I think I may have to look closer upon th main continents of Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms, paying close attention to the war raging between the Alliance and Horde.<br/><br/>Is it possible that the Rune be near where the corruption grows strongest? This is something I will have to look into this in more detail when I return from the frozen north. My Master has told me to work with the Fellowship that I despise so much, why must I work with the weak? Why must I join them and aid them when in the end they will all die.<br/><br/>The Master explained that it was strategy, disguising the wolf as a sheep to make the other sheep feel at ease, a simple explanation that makes sense to me. So I shall do it, there is one I will seek out, one that seems put off by my very appearance. I care not why nor does it truly matter for they need the help. They need the aid, and because of their need (all due to their own weakness) they will accept me, even if they hate what I represent.<br/><br/>Oh the irony of the weak.

<em>The Assassin Walks into his office and looks at a stack of papers, Sorting them, he looks to a new paper he has not seen before, the targets name? Romm'ath Sunwalker, The Hunter knew the name very well, A Common theif in Eversong, It would take a while before he was able to Kill his target. <br/><br/>He makes himself a potion that will allow his hair to grow in lenght, He decided how he was going to do it, the same messy ponytail him and his brother had since they were both young, He dyes it black so as not to be recognized amongst most people that know who he is, He slips into the shadows and rushes his way home, Jumping from Tree to tree till he reached the Small loft above Fairbreeze Village, He turned the lock with the key and walked in, He looked to see Dawnalia Sleeping with Mordicai, He smiled slightly, Something that was new to him..He was not used to actaully having feelings for some one, He kissed her forehead gently, gave the Cub a treat, and wrote a note, "Dawn, I will be out for the rest of the day, Please if you need anything ask Jeeves, He is my caretaker, With love, ~Xal"<br/><br/>He left the note and took off, once again jumping from tree to tree, till he got to Sun Sail Anchorage, There He saw him...Romm'ath Sunwalker....He was sitting on a boat, watching the harbor as his lackies loaded the ship with Jewels and gold, Things the hunter was Sure he stole, He watched for a few moments, before walking down to the boat, He stealthed, and Shot an arrow at the first two thugs, Killing them Instantly. He moved to the top deck still stealthed, came across the navigator, walking up behind him Wrung his neck, as the body fell lifelessly, he worked his way to the Hull of the ship, he sat in the chair across from Romm'ath, took an apple and Unstealthed.<br/><br/>"Hello.." The assassin spoke in his normal Calm soothing Voice.<br/>"wh--Who are you?!" Shouted the theif.<br/>"Simple." Replied Xal, "The Harbinger of your death, You have been targeted by some one..We can do this the hard way...Or the easy way.."<br/>"GUARDS, GUARDS!!!" The Theif yelled at the top of his lungs scared for his life, <br/>"They are all dead..I simply Killed them as well..I'll have to charge extra for the bodies.." His voice still calm and Soothing.<br/><br/>The theif ran away, still crying out for help as Xalandir just sat there, He sighed, and got up, He ran at fast speed, and jumped into a nearby tree, He readied his scope lense attached to a monical, one that Sol made for him, And shot an arrow into the mans leg, attached to the arrow was a rope, He tied the rope to the branch and Swung down, Romm'ath, Hanging from the tree. "I'll give you anything!! Gold!! Women!! All the mead you can drink!!"<br/>The Hunter Smirked, "Sorry, I have enough gold..I already have A girl That I love verymuch, and As far as mead goes..Im not much of a drinker." He Shot another arrow into the mans skull, A stick of Dynamite tied to it, exploded, the man's brains paint the ground. <br/><br/>A few hours later, he goes to his office to clean up, and places the paper in the pile labeled, 'Complete' he smirks, and goes home to tell Dawn that He loves her..He does...He..just wanted her to know it.</em>

<em>The Hunter Hung up with his brother in the morning, after a long night of restless sleep, Fel, he decided to take out the ones targeting his new Sister....Yea...he was an assassin but you don't ask an assassin to Kill his family members.<br/><br/>He awoke in the early morning, the sun bearly poking its head out of the sky, he woke from the couch, he looked to Dawn, smiling, He arose and made her breakfast, He didn't get to tell her last night...something had come up...he would tel her today though..he was sure of it.. after making her breakfast, (Over easy eggs, with a side of what looked to be Springpaw Sausage, and Durotar Boar Bacon.) He smiled, Kissed her softly on the cheek once and Left. Leaving another Note, "Dawn, We need to talk later, there is something important I need to tell you."<br/><br/>He Put on the last of his armor, and Stormed off, Quickly he stealthed, and jumped through the trees, He enjoyed doing this, It was a fast means of travel, and the wind felt good as it brushed his face, His first target...An Orc Named Org'thun He was a Simple buisness man who had his eye out for trackers, and assassins alike, Light nows he asked Xal to work for him once or twice...but Xal worked for him self....The League of Shadows...His own little group of Rogues and Hunters alike that killed for money.<br/><br/>He made his way to Orgimmar, Slowly tracking Org'thun..Silently watching him, waiting for the perfect moment to strike, he followed him into a bar, and asked the bartender for two drinks, Firewater Ale...Org'thun's favorite, before going to sit with Org...he Laced his drink with a special posion, One only he knew how to make...it had the feint smell of grapes...simply because it was made from the family orchid grapes...mixed with a few of Xal's special concoctions, he emptied three drops into the mug, enough to kill an Elekk, he smirked, and went to sit with Org'thun<br/><br/>"XALANDIR Meh boy!! Come sit enjoy a few moments with me!!"<br/>A fake smile stained Xal's face, "Org'thun!! Just the man I was looking for, Care to have some fire water??"<br/>"Xal, You know its my favorite! You didn't even have to ask!"<br/>Org'thun took a large gulp, not knowing he was moments away from his death.<br/>"So, tell me Xal, Have you reconsidered working for me and disbanding your little guild of Misfits?"<br/>"Actually Sir, I have come to you about a job you requested, of a woman by the name of Scarlet, Could you tell me where I could find her?"<br/>The Orc laughed, "That Little harlett?, She lives in orgrimmar I think? I was going to pay a little visit to her myself, probably get her in my bed!"<br/>Xal's face winced as he said that, "I see...Well I shall find her then, Care to join me outside for a moment?"<br/>"Of course my boy!" The orc stumbled on his way up, "Ooh...I feel a bit weary, maybe I should go home..." <br/>"Nonsense! Come there is somthing I want you to see" The orc followed Xal outside, "What Is it that you wanted me to see?" <br/>Xal Replied in his normal Calm and Soothing Voice, "You target my sister-in-law.. you dis-respect her by calling her a !@#$%...and you make her seem like she sleeps with anyone...I happen to know this is not true..because She married my brother...realize this....You do not mess with the Sunsorrow Orc.."<br/>"You little! I WILL HAVE YOUR HEAD ON A PLATE FOR THIS ELF!" shouted the orc.<br/>Xal Smirked, "Sure, but first." Xal Pushed the man to the floor, the orc fell easily.<br/>"What..what have you done to me!"<br/>"I posioned you..you are dying...even as we speak...." Xal Smirked.<br/>The orc began crawling to the river, thinknig to get away by the current, Xal quickly took out a Shiv and Stabbed the orc in the hand, driving the knife deep into the ground, <br/>"OWWWWWWW!!!" The orc shouted out in pain as the knife drove into his hand, Xal took out another and Stabbed him in the back, bringing the blade up and out of the orcs back.<br/>"Xal...my boy...please..im sorry!!" <br/>Xalandir looked at the orc, and smirked, "Sorry for what? Wanting to Kill my family?"<br/>The orc looked up at him and begain to speak a reply..but his eyes rolled to the back of his head, as the life slipped away form him.<br/><br/>Xal went back to Silvermoon, To clean himself up as he does after every little encounter. He ripped up the Contract bearing Scarlets name..and threw it into the fire. Tomorrow He would go on to the other Killer...but today...Today he was needed elsewhere, He promised her he would spend time with her, So he was going to. Maybe he would talk to Tis aswell, see how she is doing.</em>

<em>The woman with the brown hair lay awake in the bed. Beside her, she could hear the slow breathing of her husband as he slept. There was comfort in the sound, the feel of him laying next to her, but not enough to quell her mind. So much had happened in the past few hours; her world had been torn away in large chunks and it had been all out of her means to control.<br/><br/>‘The lake would be beautiful…’<br/><br/>She quietly slipped out of the bed and made her way downstairs where she settled in a chair with a mug of herbal tea and her journal. Slowly, she wrote down the words churning through her mind, filling up the last few pages in her journal.<br/><br/>***<br/>(New entry in a plain brown leather journal)</em><br/><br/>For one small moment of time, everything was falling into place. I had my husband, a home, and we had reason to believe that I might be with child.<br/><br/>Then it all crumbled into dust.<br/><br/>I am not expecting a child. Granted, I knew deep down that it too soon, but it still hurt to hear the words telling me that I wasn’t going to be a mother. What hurt worse was what my husband said to me when I told him that I wanted it to be true: he said, ‘Did you?’<br/><br/>The pain that those words brought was worse than any weapon I have felt biting into my flesh. <br/><br/>Solorin, I wanted this very, very much.<br/><br/>Did he think that I would tell him, get his hopes up only to have them smashed? Does he think that I am that cruel? <br/><br/>I know that he was hurt, angry and had more on his mind than just not being a father but at the time I needed his strength, the promise that it would be alright and we would work through it, I was simply stonewalled. My own feelings brushed aside, by not just him but also my best friend whose only words were ‘Go find him and be gentle,’ as if I were some type of unfeeling wretch that didn’t care which could not be further from the truth. I was not spared the painful disappointment of the news; it hurt me to hear it just as much as it hurt him. It would not have been just my child nor would it have been just his child. It would have been <strong>our </strong>child.<br/><br/>Invisible again… but then that may be my lot in life. I came to terms with it quite some time ago but, Light, to my own husband and friends?<br/><br/><em>‘The lake would be beautiful…’ She paused and brushed away a cold draft that caressed her cheek then continued writing.</em><br/><br/>To make matters worse my brother-in-law came to me with news that my identity in Orgrimmar had been leaked. How or by whom, I do not know, but the mechanisms in place to protect me failed. My heart was in my throat when I looked at the stack of papers in his hand and a terrible thought was churning in my mind… was one of those for Solorin? Would he even tell me? The timing could not have been worse.<br/><br/>I know that I should have told him the unhappy news, perhaps he may have been more sympathetic instead of speaking to me like I was some selfish witch, but he is a direct and to-the-point person. If I didn’t tell Solorin who I was and what I had done for Orgrimmar, he would.<br/><br/>What I have done for Orgrimmar? What I have done is put my life on the line so that other people would live. I had told Solorin long before he was my husband that there were things that I did that I could not speak of. The whole reason why it would be kept quiet was to protect me and those surrounding me. Not selfishness, not conspiracy, but protection. He acted as if he understood, as if he was alright with it. But apparently not.<br/><br/>Things are always clearer when seen in hindsight and being told that your brother held contracts on your wife’s life was just another hit he had to take today.<br/><br/>All of these things were before I became his wife—the only thing that I have done since was standard search and rescue. Nothing secret, nothing covert, I even asked if he wanted to come along. He turned the offer down. But the things that Xal spoke of were part of another life that I was walking away from for Solorin and the family that we might have. In the end, it was another blow to him. One that I tried to spare him the cost but in the end, I failed at that, too. <br/><br/><em>‘The lake would be beautiful…’ Again, she brushed away the cold draft against her skin.</em><br/><br/>Solorin received a letter today telling him that he was going to be shipped out. The Horde war machine is grinding forward and I expect that it will take a great number of the Fellowship with it—including myself. When I spoke with Blacklist last week about my decision to leave my position with Orgrimmar, he had said that he would try his best to make them understand. I wondered what he meant at the time, but now I know.<br/><br/>(1/3)

Word will come soon enough that I will also be sent off. In the end, if I were with child then I may have been spared the cost of war, but not my husband. He spoke as if he didn’t expect to come back when he handed me the letter as if we just had the one chance, which wasn’t much of a chance at all. The thought scares me that I might lose him… I thought that I had lost him tonight. The cold words, the anger… the weight of accusation I heard in his voice.<br/><br/>In the last few hours I feel as though I have lost everything that mattered, the hardest of which was the hope that soon we would have a child.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/><em>She turned to the last page in the journal, where she had written several names:</em><br/><br/>Nelaeryn, Lathlaeril, Elitharan<br/><br/>Ianara, Ariadnee, Ellafain<br/><br/><em>A tear dropped on the page, running the ink on the last name written. She sniffed and ran the back of her hand over her cheek. She set down the journal and quill on a nearby table and rubbed a hand over her face before drawing up her knees and burying her head, letting the tears come where she could not before.<br/><br/>She had been too busy trying to hold Solorin up.<br/><br/>She wept until all that was left was a dull ache. Her tears spent, she sat long a time in the chair. Eventually, she looked at the door, thinking that perhaps a stroll outside would be helpful.<br/><br/>‘The lake would be beautiful…’ This time, she did not push away the draft.<br/><br/>The lake would be beautiful, she thought as she walked out the door. The grass was wet with dew against her bare feet and the moon hung brightly in the sky. It was a harvest moon, the orange glow reflected across the rippling water turning it a brilliant hue. It was a splash of color against the otherwise black water.<br/><br/>‘The lake would be beautiful…’<br/><br/>She came to a stop at the edge, looking at the orange glow reflected in the surface. The water lapped at the shore as insects hummed in the background. A soft wind curled its way around the shoreline, rustling the leaves in the trees. She could feel the water against her feet, it would hold her, it would carry her when no one else was willing.<br/><br/>‘Remember the peace when you were sleeping?’<br/><br/>Her mind went to darkness, a familiar emptiness and floating. No lights, no sounds, nothing. It was peaceful oblivion that her restless mind welcomed, vaguely familiar as if she had been there before, but could not place it. Déjà vu…<br/><br/>An image appeared in her mind, one that had been struggling to take form for quite some time. A bone pendant, she remembered picking it up. What pendant? She didn’t have one… yes, yes she did. It was in her bag, the one that she touched every day and didn’t remember.<br/><br/>Didn’t remember… but it didn’t matter. Nothing mattered. She was warm, floating, surrounded by a ribbon of orange.<br/><br/>‘No one will miss you. Breathe deeply…’<br/><br/>She opened her mouth to inhale, nothing did matter. She was nothing and now that they weren't going to have a family, what did anything else matter? Not her, not her husband...<br/><br/>Solorin… a cold shock came over her. It did matter… he mattered.<br/><br/>With a start, she opened her eyes and realized that she was deep underwater. She struggled to the surface, breaking it with a cough. Choking and spitting water she looked around trying to get her bearings. The shore seemed very far away and she had no idea how she ended up outside in the lake. Her last memory was sitting in a chair in the house, but that would be a matter to ponder later; if she didn’t get to shore she wasn’t going anywhere but to the bottom.<br/><br/>The key was to control the panic that was threatening to set in. She could swim. She could make it… no, no, no… not could, would. She would make it. She would…<br/><br/>‘Remember the peace when you were sleeping?’<br/><br/>That voice! She slowly swam towards the shore, her teeth chattering as a wave of cold hit her. The memory of the past twenty minutes was coming back.<br/><br/>She wanted snarl, “Get out of my head,” but was choking on water and could not speak. She felt a rush of relief as her feet touched the bottom of the lake. She pushed herself towards the shoreline and pulled herself onto the cool grass where she lay for several long moments choking out water and struggling for air.<br/><br/>She had been lured out into the lake by something. It was something that came to the surface when she felt insecure. Certainly, that was a key, but what was it? The pendant… At the moment, she was too spent to care and continued to lay there for several long minutes before gathering the strength to pull herself up and back to the house.</em><br/><br/>(2/3)

<em>Her first stop was to tear through her bag, coming up with the pendant she looked at it. How long had this thing been with her? Since her first trip to Northrend when the nightmares started. She was not an expert on these matters but certainly it was a coincidence and not a good thing. She tossed it in the hearth and covered it with embers.<br/><br/>She watched the thing burn for a few minutes in the smoldering embers of the banked fire before turning to head up the stairs. As quietly as she could, she pulled dry clothing from the wardrobe and went back downstairs to change her cloths. The wet items she hung outside before taking a towel and drying her hair.<br/><br/>Chilled, troubled, and exhausted, she curled in the warm bed and stared at the wall. When sleep finally overcame her, it was a dark, dreamless, oblivion.</em><br/><br/>(3/3)

I talked briefly with Kel'tira. It was a another sad tale in the saga of Kel'tira Sunblaze. I wonder if being the guild mistress, or guildmaster, puts a target on your back? Kidnapped, forced to realize the darkness that lives within her, and let it out, instead of being a sacrifice for light knows what.<br/><br/>Karamia said Kel is stronger than she looks. I disagreed, I think Kel puts up a damn fine front for the Fellowship. But there are other things that eat at Kel, things that pull at the darkness within her, and I must be the only one that sees it, or has been privy to it. I don't know, I only know what my heart tells me. And my sister/cousin isn't as strong as she appears. Light, where's Nicias? She derives strength from him, his love gives her strength. Doesn't anyone else see this? <br/><br/>I cannot sit with her any longer. It causes strife where I do not want strife. So, I must stay away from Kel. I hope she understands. My life with my wife means more to me than anything else in the world. Mia is my world. Does she know this? Does she even realize it?<br/><br/>I'm feeling sort of poorly. Probably some bug I picked up in Uldim. I think I'll find a quiet corner of the world, pull a blanket over my shoulders and rest. Just rest. Why do I feel so cold, then hot? One minute I'm shivering like a wet dog, then sweating like all get out. I've never been sick in my life...now this. Maybe "mom" would let me stay for a day or two to get over this. I don't want to bring her grief...I'll find some little hole in the wall place. I feel so tired and weak suddenly.

Alenthis had spent the last several days spying on both the Horde and Alliance. He had been trying to think of a way to start a battle so that the rune of war would reveal itself. It had seemed almost hopeless. He stood on the top of a mountain in the Southern Barrens glancing down at the Great Gate. He sighed quietly. <br/><br/>"How am I supposed to get them motivated when their so-" Alenthis paused as the Great Gate started to open. A Tauren emerged. Alenthis recognized him as Baine. He watched closely. Another Tauren emerged, then another. An Army. The longer he watched, he realized where they were headed. They were headed for Theramore. Alenthis frowned slightly to himself. It was quite a bold move by Garrosh. Alenthis smiled slightly. Perhaps the rune would reveal itself now.<br/><br/>He sat back down onto the plateau and watched the army march. Alenthis thought of Lyrilia. He missed her so...but he had no way to get to her without Viragona noticing. He thought of his brother-in-law. His letter wouldn't be arriving. Alenthis sighed again. Things were getting a bit out of hand. When things quieted down, perhaps he would go find a place to relax. And just stay there for a decade or two...

Azurick opened his eyes. And nearly vomited. He had been drinking away his sorrow for the past four days. He gagged slightly and pulled himself into a sitting position. He was in his study in Dalaran. He picked up a glass of water and drink some of it. His stomach settled slightly. Azurick stood up and stumbled to the window. It was a beautiful day in Northrend...there had been many beautiful days now that Arthas was gone. He sighed and dressed quickly. There was no use mourning over Alenthis any longer. The time had come for him to move on. He had loved Alenthis deeply. Like a blood brother. But Azurick had other matters to attend to. He had a responsibility as a Blood Mage to learn enough that he could one day teach others.<br/><br/>Azurick summoned a Fel orb to hover above his head. He preferred one isolated orb, over the standard three. He felt it was easier to control. He grabbed his staff and hooked it onto his back. He turned the door handle and swung the door open.<br/><br/>Azurick nearly jumped. An Undead man stood outside the door, a box in his hand. <br/><br/>"Delivery for Azurick Sunstrider. Terribly sorry for your loss. These are his things we recovered from his study in the Undercity." The undead finished his sarcastic apology and dropped the box on the floor. He spun around and headed back towards the dragonhawk master. Azurick stared at the box for a moment. He sighed. Class could wait. He picked the box up and hefted it inside. He slammed the door shut behind him.<br/><br/>The Blood Mage set the box on his table and pulled up a chair next to it. He began pulling things out. There were several have finished letters to various Alliance diplomats. A painting of Sylvanas. Charts and reference tables having to do with Alliance trade supply and troop deployments. Azurick spotted a small black book. He removed it and opened it up. It had a rather awful drawing of a Blood Elf woman in Paladin armor. Beside the picture, their were several thoughts Alenthis had written down. Azurick frowned as he read them. His brother had loved this woman...he had found someone to love...after all the times that he swore he wouldn't. Azurick frowned. <br/><br/>"And now he's dead..." He muttered to himself. He flipped the page over. A name was on the back. <em>Lyrilia.</em> Azurick stared at the name for a moment. It sounded familiar. He thought for a moment...and it came to him. <br/><br/><em>The woman I spoke to in the hall of Respite! Of course. She seemed so upset...</em>Azurick frowned. His brother had loved this woman. Azurick knew what he had to do. If this woman had brought his brother happiness...he had to meet her again. He would go to her. And protect her...He would pay back his debt to Alenthis by helping this girl. <em>Alenthis would have wanted that...</em> Azurick scribbled the name down on a scrap of paper. "Lyrilia." He frowned slightly and glanced at the hour-glass across the room. He was already fifteen minutes late for class. Azurick scowled in annoyance and bolted for the door. He shoved it open and locked it behind him. He thought as he ran. He would find this Lyrilia. Perhaps he could repay the debt his brother owed the Fellowship too. Perhaps.

I shall try to think when I wake.<br/><br/> <em> A new entry placed lower down on the page, the writing almost shakier, more smudged.</em><br/><br/>Never write when drunk, and in withdrawal at the same time. I hurt my head even more than I did now reading that.<br/><br/>What have I done to myself? I can't even write straight, my hands are much too jittery, I snap more often than usual...but I feel better with it. I take it, and I feel empowered almost, that delicious nip of arcane it has...the pain lost in that feeling,just for a moment. <br/><br/>Then even that wasn't enough. The little bit here and there turned into a constant need...an addiction...my withdrawals are even worse than those many years ago...<br/><br/> <em> Ink blots the page as the warrior breaks her quill in frustration, slamming the broken bits on the desk and pulling out a fresh one. Taking a deep breath she attempts to collect herself, which doesn't entirely work.</em><br/><br/>Alcohol. Of course I'd turn to that. I write too much in this book! But where else am I to go? who else am I to turn to...more I need more. I must not think of this..it makes it worse...and added pain. I hate this! I'll use the last bit in my bags, and that last bit in the flask. I cannot wean myself off of it..I need help. Help I am too proud to find. I do not need it! I am strong!<br/><br/>No I am not.<br/><br/>~Lyrillia Dawnblade

<em>The assassin woke in the early hours of the morning, he didn't want to disturb Dawn in her rest, so like a shadow, he swiftly got his gear, he went to her, and kissed her on the forehead, softly so as not to wake her, just as he always did before he left, he told her last night...he told her that he loved her, and she said she loved him...he pondered if she did or not...if she told him just to make him feel happy, but he sighed and took off, this time, he called for his raptor...and road away, it wasnt far, his nex target was a man named Kal'thesus, A well known magister amongst the lowly mages and arcanists, he road all the way to Duskwither Spire.<br/><br/>As he reached the grounds, he took out three arrows, thats all he needed for this job, nothing more, nothing less, he somehow knew what he was going to need at all times, and...like always, he was right, he saw six thugs...Seeing as the man was always protected...he had no choice but to take out his special throwing knives, sharpened to the finest point, the ends dipped in poison, he threw two of them, getting the first two thugs in the forehead, they as they fell to the ground blood leaking form their skulls he stealthed and made his way to the middle of the spire. <br/><br/>There he saw another two guards, this time he took out two Dirks, a gift from his brother whilst he was in training, stealthed he came up behind one guard, cupping the mans mouth with his hand, he stabbed one dirk into the mans chest, caving in the chest cavity, and peircing the mans heart, the man died instantly. He made his way to the second man, his other Dirk in hand, he looked around to make sure it was just him and the second thug, he came up behind the man, tapping him on the right shoulder the man turned quickly, "Huh?! Who's there?!" Xal quickly tapped the man again this time from the front, the man looked infront of him, Xal unstealthed and sliced the mans throat so he would not make a sound, he then stabbed him agian nailing him in the jugular vein, as the man fell lifelessly to the floor, Xal made his way up to the top tower.<br/><br/>Looking through the key hole he saw three men, the last two thugs, and Kal'thesus, Xal wanted to question the man, so he dipped one arrow into a paralyzation poison, he kicked open the door, the three men looked at him, suprised the two thugs made their way to him, Xal shot the three arrows, hitting the two men in the windpipe, they fell like leaves hitting the floor and sliding across the room, he shot the last arrow at the man in the abdomen, making sure he did not get any vital organs, the man looked at Xal and slumped to the floor.<br/><br/>Xal placed a bag on the man's head so he would not know where he was, he threw a bucket of water on the man to wake him up.<br/><br/>"Wake up you Selfish pig." Xal said coldly.<br/>"Wh--Who are yo--you?" the man said shakily, Kal was confused as to who was talking to him, but continued.<br/>"Why are you hunting Scarlet?" Xal asked.<br/>"Scarlet?" replied Kal...he did not remember, but Xal would make him remember.<br/>Xal stabbed the man in the leg.<br/>"Agh!!!!!" Kal yelled out in pain, "I don't know who you are talkin--" the man stopped a grin across his face, "Scarlet!! Ah yes..her friend was the blonde !@#$%...that loved to--" Xal slapped him, "Don't talk about my sister like that you son of a ^-*!@." <br/>"She did a job for me once, I need some info about a man hiding out in Dalaran, she's the one who got the info! Thats all I know! Don't hurt me anymore please!!" Xal smirked, he punched the man in the gullet, making the man throw up, "I'm Sor-" Xal Kicked him in the chest knocking him and the chair on the floor, "ARGH!!" Kal yelled out in pain as Xal hit him, Xal leaned down and wispered in the mans ear, "Don't ever...talk about a sunsorrow in such a manner, now..You have to pay." Xal took out another throwing knife, and stabbed the man repedidly in the chest killing him, he left him there on the floor, and walked out.<br/><br/>And again..just like every other job, he went to is office, and cleaned up, he then made his way to his home, to spend a little more time with Dawn. </em>

<em>The journal was once a bright red with golden enbroiding around the edges. Now however, the journal is worn and the colors slightly faded. Various momentos collected and written by the author over the years can be seen poking out between pages. In faded gold lettering the name Dawnalia Skyblaze is written across the cover.</em><br/><br/>Finally! I finally have my journal back! Gran sent it to me in the mail with her angry letter. I haven't written to her in quite a while and she was not happy. I wrote back to her, but I think it will take her some time to cool down. That really doesn't matter though, because I am happy! I adore everything about Eversong Woods in Silvermoon City. I love the house I've been allowed to stay in, I love my training as a paladin, and I love my adorable Winterspting Cub, Mordicai. But if right now, at this very moment, someone walked up to me and asked what the best part about moving here was, I would give them one answer. Xalandir Sunsorrow.<br/><br/>I've never met anyone quite like him. He has let me stay in his house and gone out of his way to make sure I am comfortable. He gifted me two wonderful cubs so I would not be lonely. He showed me his gift. Yes, that us what I call it. He is simply amazing in the wild. He taught me to ride a dragon. And he..... he said he loved me. Just last night he told me so. And.... I said I loved him. I really believe I do. I've never felt like this before. But, I think I do love him. I don't care what he does for a living. I don't care. Xalandir is a good person, I am sure of it. Gran would probably scold me. She would say I should be more careful. But for once she is wrong. Xal is not my brother. They are nothing alike. <br/><br/>I can not wait to see him again. I feel so happy whenever I do.

<em>Tislina Dawnrunner sits a her desk reading a thick tome. Amethyst perches on the edge of the desk and coos softly once in a while, resulting in a smile and a pat on the head from Tis. Eventually finishing a chapter, Tislina walks to her bed and sits down with her journal and quill. Amethyst is very quick to curl up in her lap as Tis puts the quill to a blank page.</em><br/><br/>As it seems things are again going well. Everyday I think how lucky I am to have Xal as a friend. I've taken to visiting him everyday. As far as I am concerned he saved my life. If it were not for him and Krei, I do not think I could have defeated Keyadrion then and there. And he again helped me yesterday. After my little run in with Keyadrion, Krei asked if I was all right. This was a complete lie. Keyadrion had some very, very strong Fel fire so I continued to feel the very painful affects for days after. Why didn't I tell Krei of my injury? Because he has enough to worry about as it is! I didn't want to give him something else to worry about. Anyways, yesterday I ended up telling Xal about it because he could tell something was wrong. He healed it actually. He concocted some type of liquid and rubbed it onto my side where the burn was. I can't even feel the pain anymore! After that he walked me home and let me into my house because I seemed to have lost my key. Then he went home to tell a girl he loved her! I am so happy for him. I went to see him not long ago and he said it went good, though he had his doubts. I certainly hope it works our for him. <br/><br/>I went to my brothers grave again this morning. I don't know why, but since finding out Xal knew him I have been thinking of my family a lot. What has become of my sisters? Would I even be informed if they passed? I don't know, but after visiting Tavarus's grave I felt better. Though I am still saddened by what happened, I am glad it did. If it had not, the best thing ever for me would not have come to pass. I would not have joined the Fellowship. As Xalandir and I decided, it is all in the past.<br/><br/>On a completely different note, Amethyst is one of the many bright spots I keep finding in my life. She seems to know how I feel at all times and often when I am sad she will try to cheer me up. It is very clear that I love her and she loves me. The two of us have to go now though. I need to retrace my steps, for I have yet to find my house key......

Alot has been happening since I last wrote. I suppose I'll start with the worse side of things. Keyadrion has struck again, this time on Tislina. She said he used Fel Fire that shattered her wards. Her friend Xalandir somehow knew she was in trouble when it happened, and took me to save her. After we scared my brother off, I asked her if she was okay. She said she was, but I thought something was wrong. Anyways, we talked for a while, mainly about Keyadrion, but she had to leave, eventually. He also has been messing with my head, trying to get me to do things I never would, like harm Tislina. Hopefully, he cant force me to do what he wants... Anyways, on a brighter side of things, my friend Loki asked me if he could talk to me in person over the guildstone. We met in the Hall of Respite, and Triannia was there also. They then asked me if I would marry them. I said I would, and we did it at the Cape of Stranglethorn Vale, on a beach, with just the three of us. I personally think I did well, for my first time doing such a thing. I also went to Tislina and I's spot, where she came looking for me. She asked me about my trip to Northrend, and I had also asked if she wanted to stay the night together out there, like we did before. She said no, because Amethyst needed food. We ended up in her room at Wayfarers Rest, though, later. I had to leave her there in the morning, as my trainer had something to teach me. Like always. Nothing else has been happening to me recently... I'm done writing.
