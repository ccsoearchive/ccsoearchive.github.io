<strong> <em>Your conscience... It governs your morality, and guides your ability to make the "right" decision. But, what are "right" decisions? How are we supposed to tell what is evil, and what is righteous. We are all puppets in this world; I'm tired of being a puppet. We are in servitude to our moral standings, but no one is my master. Although, there is still one thing that controls me.</em></strong><br/><br/>Slithengar fidgets and rubs the jet black ring that surrounds an inch of his middle finger on his left hand. The voice has stopped for now. He wants the voice to be stopped permanently, but each day it leads back to gulping down the contents of his silver canteen. Today could be no different, but if it is; the master always has tomorrow.<br/><br/><strong> <em>Weak, pathetic, crippled. These words float in my head, threatening to consume my entire being. And for what? Satisfaction? If I could remember what regret was, I'm sure it would have to be similar to me wishing I never met you. [Me]<br/><br/>Touching, and here I thought we were becoming such pals. <br/><br/>Pals? Hardly, the relationship is mutual. [Me]<br/><br/>Mutual? You say that after all we've been through? I'd leave, but as things stand, you do have me wrapped around your finger. <br/><br/>Oh so you're a comic now? Where do you find time to come up with those puns. [Me]<br/><br/>I've been saving that one up for a good while now. What's the matter? You seem a little on edge today. Are you trying to get rid of your addiction?</em></strong><br/><br/>Slithengar stops staring at the ground and begins staring at the cathedral across from him. He continues contemplating walking into the cathedral. <br/><br/><strong> <em>All my problems could be solved if I walked in there. [Me]<br/><br/>But you won't. Just take another drink, and the voice will stop. It always does.</em></strong><br/><br/>Slithengar pulls out a silver canteen from underneath his chest plate. He takes the cap off, and looks at the vile green liquid contents inside. His "vile" master still controls him for another day. Slithengar closes his eyes as he gulps down the contents of his canteen. As he opens his eyes, day turns to night. He awakens to a bell tolling, the cycle for the next day continues.<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>It may seem to be a little random because I will eventually put in flashbacks, but they will not be in any particular order. A lot of this will probably be composed of Man VS. Himself and Man VS. Man (or his "voice").

Slithengar opened his eyes to see a familiar faces walking around town as normal.<br/><br/>"Wakey wakey. Hey sleeping beauty, you shouldn't be sleeping on the public benches. You sure do sleep a lot."<br/><br/>"Well seeing I don't have anything else to do, sleeping is the next best choice."<br/><br/>"Why don't you do something productive, like return to Deepholm. I have warned you about sleeping on the benches; I'll let it slide this time. How about next night you find a inn?<br/><br/>Slithengar grumbled before getting up and stretching. “I don’t think I’ll return to Deepholm… Ever.” His voice was serious, and his gaze cold. The guard shrugged, “Azeroth could use Northrend Heroes.” <br/><br/>Slithengar grimaced at the word “hero”. The truth was that Slithengar contemplated joining the Twilight Cultists, but by better judgement, he tossed that idea aside. Even as frozen as he thought his heart was, he could never join the Twilight Cult. There were too many people he cared for, even if he wouldn’t show or admit it.<br/><br/>He began walking toward the Blue Recluse. People smiled at him as he walked by, he tried his best to smile back. He could never pull it off well though. He just doesn’t understand the point of it. Slithengar continued to hang his head low and walking on the grass. <br/><br/><em><strong> Another drink old timer? If you keep this up, you may die of liver failure.<br/><br/>Old timer?</strong></em><br/><br/>Slithengar began counting on his fingers. He started talking aloud, “How old am I? I don’t remember.” He stopped at the mage tower and looked up toward the door. <em><strong>Outland. I could escape it all if I went there. </strong></em>He put his hand over his chest as he looked toward the Blue Recluse. A paladin he recognized, he thought for a second before muttering “Gentyl.” His heart began to beat more intensely as he shook his head. It’s only a paladin, nothing to get worried over.<br/><br/>He walked in slowly, and through all the commotion in the room he could only hear his footsteps on the floor. He observed everyone he could before he sat down in his “usual spot”. He glanced toward the bar to see the druid whose name he hadn’t caught, laying on the bar. <br/><br/>His attention shifted to the Draenei Death Knight Cyrus. So many questions he wanted to ask but he could never form the right words. He shook his head and convinced himself that he will ask in a more convenient time. He looked toward Gentyl and opened his mouth to speak, but then shut it. He began his ritual of staring at the table and slowly drinking the day away.<br/>

<strong> <em>Awaken, awaken and rise out of the ground.</em></strong><br/><br/>A dirt covered bone hand broke through the earth and with it a forsaken head emerged from the ground as well. The foul stench of rotting corpses and decaying flesh mixed together with the smoke. The land rumbled at hundreds of bodies clawed their way upwards while the cackling of fire and screams filled their ears.<br/><br/>Dawn turned to dusk and the looks on each person's face were as ominous and puzzled as the next. Former Horde and Alliance alike were in the presence of each other, but the quarrels of their past did not hinder their now seemingly common goal. <br/><br/>A man in a black robe stood up and began to speak, "Hello my Brothers and Sisters. We have never met until today, but we were destined to be together." He spread his arms out as if he were embracing everyone. "We were picked by our ruler, the Lich King, so that his <em>power</em> can grow to even greater heights. <br/><br/>A wave of upset commotion disrupted the speaker. At that moment he rose a hand and the feet beneath them all became frozen, and the ice traveled up and covered their mouths. "Silence is what we will have when I am speaking. Good, now that everyone is agreed. We will have a contest. The rules are simple." He stepped down from his podium with a large smile on his face. "Fight to the death." A massive ball of unholy energy flew toward the ground knocking them and Slithengar down.<br/><br/>An Orc who fell by Slithengar stood up and yelled, "LOK'TAR OGAR! I WILL NEVER BETRAY THE HORDE!" He lent his hand to Slithengar to pick him up. Slithengar brushed his hand away, at that moment he saw his flesh ridden bony hand. "I'm... I'm a Forsaken?! NO! IT ISN'T TRUE!" He rose to his feet and ran through the crowd pushing whoever was in his way aside, or to the ground. <br/><br/>He continued running until he fell, he landed on his knees and stared at his reflection in the pond. Slithengar rubbed his face and swiped at where his jaw was supposed to be. "It... It is true? But how? How did I die?" He quickly returned to his feet and marched back to the audience of death knights. Upon re-arriving, the ground was littered with bodies. Death Knight corpses along with Scarlet Crusade corpses scattered the grounds while a few death knights remained standing. <br/><br/>The man in the black robe stood there before a purple haze gate, "Beyond this Death Gate will lead you to the Acherus, there you will begin your death knight training." Each of them walked through the gate, but none reappeared out of the other side. Slithengar reached his hand and was swallowed, but instead of showing up in the presence of more death knights he was falling in a black void with voices constantly talking in his head.<br/><br/><strong><em>Isn't there anything we can do?<br/>He's dying! Do something!<br/>What is in this canteen? Is this... Blood? What in the Light, that is Fel tainted blood.<br/>What has he been up too?<br/>What kind of poison is it?<br/>Must be Fel poisoning, who knows what he has been putting into his body.<br/></em></strong><br/><br/>Slithengar opened his eyes to see familiar faces staring back at him. A man he did not recognize other than being a priest shook his head, "I'm sorry, but we had to feed you the Fel Blood that was in the canteen. We could not risk cleansing such poisoning on you... Because... Well you know." Slithengar attempted to rise to his feet, his voice was raspy and quiet. "How long have I been like this?" <br/><br/>A dwarf rubbed his beard before replying, "About two weeks. Two weeks of surviving some sort of food poisoning. But I guess you're alright eh?" He slapped Slithengar on the back which caused him to cough up a dark green and red blood. Slithengar growled and turned to his friend, a draenei warrior. He began to start choking him, "Gorboro! You know I was having withdrawal symptoms from the Fel Blood! So you food poisoned me to try and kill me? I KNEW YOU WERE UP TO SOMETHING!"<br/><br/>The dwarf punched Slithengar in the knees which brought him to the ground, "That is no way to treat a ranking officer! You will have to leave!" Slithengar spat at the dwarf, "I'm not in the military, I don't follow your rules. I don't follow anyone, or anything!"<br/><br/><strong><em>Your heart is so cold... So black with frostbite.<br/><br/>Don't talk to me, don't even ... <br/><br/>I think I like you now. But, don't you have some righteous act to do?<br/><br/>My friend... <br/><br/>He tried to kill you, so what is next on your redemption to do list?<br/><br/>Redemption is overrated, let the world burn.</em></strong>

Slithengar sat in the recluse noticing Catrella and Wolfgaar walking in. He looked on with a stern look on his face as he heard Wolfgaar mention something about himself and her courting. Slithengar began to tune them out as Rhumple continued to insist on helping him because he was a “Love Scientist.” <br/><br/>Rhumple began to “set the mood” with some purple haze, and some bright lighting. Rhumple messed with a device and claimed something about “Ten romantic songs at once were ten times romancier.” The music blasted and people were yelling back and forth to try and get their voice heard. Slithengar sighed as he walked out of the Recluse and to take a seat away from the noise.<br/><br/>Slithengar took a seat and stared deeply at the table, a night elf women not far to his left approached him as Slithengar took his gaze from the table to the sign. “Does something bother you?” <br/><br/>“Nothing I care to talk about.”<br/><br/>“Do you not wish to ease your mind?”<br/><br/>“No.”<br/><br/>The night elf sighed, “Very well… I will leave you to your loneliness.”<br/><br/>Slithengar sighed, slightly annoyed. The night elf turned to him before walking inside. “It will get to you eventually.” Slithengar cocked his head slightly. “What is that supposed to mean?” She ignored him and Slithengar followed. <br/><br/>Slithengar passed Wolfgaar asking Rhumple if people would think him the “ladies man”. He approached her again, who seemed to still ignore him while she was grabbing a drink. “What was that supposed to mean?” Slithengar followed her up the stairs, he passed Wolfgaar again who asked Sarapis if she was going to allow Rhumple to find him a man. Rhumple shook his head, “She prefers that I not find a man. For her.” <br/><br/>Slithengar zoned everyone out as he continued his conversation with the night elf. “What did you mean by that?”<br/><br/>She chuckled. “Well… How did you take it?”<br/><br/>“I do not know what you meant by it.”<br/><br/>“You just seemed…. Like something was slowly eating away at you, no?”<br/><br/>Maybe, Maybe not.” She frowned at Slithengar’s response. “Is it wrong to be concerned?” Slithengar ignored the question. “If there is nothing bothering you, you would have not come up here.<br/>“Perhaps I don’t see what you meant, “it will eventually get to you.” You said that like you know me.”<br/><br/>“Just because I do not know you, that does not mean we have not had the same feelings” Slithengar with a confused look, was starting to get more curious. “Oh? What would those feelings be?”<br/><br/>“Well first and fore most, you seem angry when I even said as much as hello.”<br/><br/>“I seem angry? Angry, not even close.””<br/><br/>“Beyond that just frustration. Well then… Perhaps I miss read you. I tend to jump to conclusions. Why did you come up here?”<br/><br/>“I wanted to know what you meant by, “It will eventually get to you.” His voice was getting harsher as he felt he already explained why he was still talking to her.<br/><br/>She sighed and sunk into her chair. Slithengar began to zone in everyone else; he could hear a conversation between Wolfgaar and Rhumple. “You damn near ruined everything!” Slithengar shrugged as he headed down stairs to grab a drink, “No point in quitting tonight.” He took a few drinks, catching some words here and there.<br/><br/>He decided to approach Wolfgaar, with the best intent to help him out. “Internal Parasites? Does that sound logical to ask someone?” Wolfgaar shook his head. “What was the other thing he was whispering you about? Take my advice, don’t listen to this gnome.” Wolfgaar and Rhumple continued their bickering and Slithengar took a seat by the bar, across from the night elf from previously.<br/><br/>She stared him down for a minute, Slithengar looked at her, “Somethin’ catch your eye? Don’t believe I’ve given you cause to stare.” She continued to stare, “No! I’m just frustrated with you.”<br/><br/>“Frustrated with me?”<br/><br/>“Yes! I just do not get you, but I guess that’s why I try to stay away from the city.”<br/><br/>“Maybe I try to be a hard man to get?” Slithengar turned to Rhumple. “Hey Love Scientist”, come here.” Rhumple ignored Slithengar, and continued a conversation with Sarapis, Kandri and Wolfgaar. Slithengar tried a couple more fail attempts at getting Rhumple’s attention. So much for mocking him.<br/><br/>She turned to Slithengar, “Looks like he is busy.”<br/>“Busy giving out bad advice…. That fool soaks it right up.”<br/><br/>“I’ve heard worse advice.” Wolfgaar turned his attention to Slithengar, staring. Slithengar mumbled something about how being in love was useless but yet even he knows what to say and what not to say. Slithengar motioned Rhumple over. “Guess your “Love Scientist” advice isn’t as good as you thought.” The night elf looked over at Slithengar, “You do not really wish to take advice from him do you?”<br/><br/>Slithengar shook his head, “I’m interested into hearing what idiotic ideas he has. She grabbed a bottle off the table and began to take a drink. Slithengar looked at her, “So what about you… You need a hand from the “love scientist.”

She turned back at him with a harsh glare, “There is no need for such thing.”<br/><br/>“No need for a love, or for a love scientist?”<br/><br/>“No, I have no need. What about you?... Do you need a love doctor?”<br/><br/>Slithengar shook his head, “No.” His voice was quiet and soft almost inaudible which hinted he was lying.<br/><br/>“Or perhaps you just need love?” Slithengar laughed, “Yea right.” She chuckled, “Well I guess that makes two of us.” Slithengar stared at the table, trying to convince himself that he did not need love. She moved to a seat closer to Slithengar.<br/><br/>“That’s it isn’t it?”<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>“Love?”<br/><br/>“What about it….?”<br/><br/>She learned in and whispered, “Where you ever in love?” Slithengar shook his head no. She sighed, “Let’s start with something else then. What is it that you do?”<br/><br/>“What do I do? Sit around here, fight when there is things that need fought.”<br/><br/>“So you are a soldier?”<br/><br/>“No. I fight, to fight.”<br/><br/>“So what do you fight for?”<br/><br/>“I don’t fight for anything… The thrill although….”<br/><br/>“The thrill?”<br/><br/>“Yes.”<br/><br/>“What about fighting is thrilling.”<br/><br/>“Overpowering your enemies. Knowing that someone can’t stop you.”<br/><br/>“I could never take joy in that… just seems… so… so… wrong in a way.”<br/><br/>“It is the only thing I could love.” She looked down at Slithengar’s waist then at his eyes. “Wait, those blades… Are you a….?”<br/><br/>“A what? Oh…” Slithengar leaned in to whisper. “Assassin?” She leaned in as well. “Yes.”<br/><br/>“No.”<br/><br/>“Then what are you?”<br/><br/>“I am a fighter…. Not sure how to explain.”<br/><br/>“Not sure, or don’t want to while you are here?”<br/><br/>“Whatever happens after I’ve won though.” Slithengar grinned, “That is a different story.” <br/><br/>She sank back into her chair and looked down at the floor. “You sure are different.”<br/><br/>“Different… How?”<br/><br/>“I have not interacted with many humans in my lifetime… It has just been me and my studies for so many years.”<br/><br/>“Do you not know I am adeath knight? A supposed “cold blooded killing machine”.”<br/><br/>She leaned forward, “I thought you might be.” He smiled on the inside, “We can table that topic for another day.”<br/><br/>“You know…. You and me are more alike than you know.”<br/><br/>“Right…. If you knew me, you probably wouldn’t be here now.”<br/><br/>“We have one common bond.”<br/>Slithengar folded his arms. “Oh?” At that time, a druid that stood there spoke. “Let me guess. Your races despises you?” She looked at the druid. “And you are?”<br/><br/>“An observer, nothing more.”<br/><br/>“You know eavesdropping is rude?”<br/><br/>“Nope. G’day!” With that the druid walked off.<br/><br/>Slithengar shrugged, “If that is a common bond. Maybe I can break it. Do you care if people despise you? I don’t.<br/><br/>“No, you are right… But it’s a start. Do you think everyone fears you?”<br/><br/>“Whether they fear me is up to them. I care not.”<br/><br/>“Do you wish to be accepted?... To find love?... To do more than just kill?”<br/><br/>“Yes, no and maybe?”<br/><br/>“Well then…”<br/><br/>‘Or, maybe, no and no. If I were to find love, I think it would have been found already.”<br/><br/>“Love can take as long as it pleases. You can not control it. So I suggest you keep looking sir.”<br/><br/>“I never said I looked.”<br/><br/>She looked at Slithengar before walking off, “You were given a second chance, perhaps now you can find it.” Slithengar looked confused, “What does THAT mean?”<br/><br/><br/>A hour passed as Slithengar sat there, motionless and quiet. He learned that the night elf’s name was Zellinore. She was having a conversation with a few of the Watch who came to have a drink. He continued to sit there, waiting until he could not take it much longer.<br/><br/>Slithengar looked at Zellinore, “You said something about I was given a second chance. I have thought about this for too long now. What did you mean by that?”<br/><br/>She excused herself from the table and looked down at Slithengar. “Come with me.” He followed her into the Recluse’s cellar. Slithengar scoffed at the Watch’s comments on the way down.<br/><br/>“Careful now. Miss.<br/><br/>“She’s a mage Heiden. You should tell the other guy to be careful.”<br/><br/>Slithengar folded his arms. “You talk in riddles or something.”<br/><br/>“How so?”<br/><br/>“You mentioned before you left, that I had a second chance. What did you mean by that?”<br/><br/>“Tell me, can you remember a time before you became a death knight.”<br/><br/>“Yes. Most of it is vivid.”<br/><br/>“Was there someone you loved then?”<br/><br/>“no”<br/><br/>“Did you die alone? With no one to care you ere gone?”<br/><br/>Slithengar stood there, thinking,. “I did die alone. And? That is how I lived my life. I could only live breathe and speak the shadows. There was no time for love, or other people.<br/><br/>“Fool, even the darkest of souls have time for love.”<br/><br/>“If that was so.” Slithengar shook his head. “Not always true.”<br/><br/>“Perhaps you would not have died back then if you had someone to live for. Do not shake your head…. You know it’s true.”

Slithengar’s face became redder than it normally was. “No. I died because I was looking for power and strength.”<br/><br/>“Perhaps you would have found it if there was someone you wanted to keep safe, someone you cared for? That extra motive? You have emotions… Now choose to show them that’s your choice!”<br/><br/>Slithengar sighed, in his head knowing she was a little bit right. “Maybe, or maybe not. But that is no reason for a second chance.”<br/><br/>“Do you want to die alone again?”<br/><br/>Slithengar walked up the stairs as he said. “If it happens, then it happens.”<br/><br/>She yelled, “That is no way to live!”<br/><br/>The Watch looked with concern as Slithengar and Zellinore emerged from the cellar. “Why do you want to convince me to find love? Maybe your words are just covering up your own needs.” Slithengar scoffed, “Women, just like them to try and rub off their emotions on you.”<br/><br/>Zellinore let out a long sigh. “He is just a stubborn fool.” Slithengar stared as Aristillus and Zellinore went outside to talk. The other Watch members began to talk, Slithengar ignored most of what they said.<br/><br/>“Women piss me off. Always think they are right, and call us stubborn.”<br/><br/>Slithengar sulked for a few minutes. He then approached outside and walked to Zellinore. He leaned over and whispered in her ear, “Some of those things I can not admit.” He straightened up, “I’m sorry.”<br/>

Mithara sat across from Slithengar, exchanging a few words. Although he did not feel like speaking to her. She was definitely the last person he wanted to see. A few minutes passed by and he decided to walk outside. He nearly ran into Catrella who was going to enter. He smiled at her “Hello.” <br/><br/>She greeted him warmly, “How are you today?”<br/><br/>“Eh, fine I suppose. You?”<br/><br/>“I am fine. Just enjoying the air.”<br/><br/>Slithengar nodded and noticed a slight uncomforted look on her face. “I think I shall go inside.” He followed taking a deep sigh. They sat down, and silence fell on the table. Slithengar looked uneasy, “Day just started feels like it has been going on for a while now.” Catrella looked at him, unsure of what to say.<br/><br/>Slithengar chuckled to himself, “Last night was kind of interesting. Kind of have to feel bad for Wolfgaar though.”<br/><br/>Catrella looked down blushing. “Um, I don’t want to talk about that fiasco.” Slithengar shrugged. She continued to mutter something about nosy women and meddling gnomes. Mithara perked up, “….Oh, Rhumple was there.”<br/><br/>Catrella gave a thiny “huff” at Mithara, “If you must know rhumple thought he should give Wolfgaar advice in courting me and it was terrible.” <br/><br/>Slithengar interjected, “Terrible is an understatement.” <br/><br/>“Whatever you do Mith, do not seek romantic advice from a gnome in a helmet.” She snorted, “He’s still convinced that my poor employee is… that.” Mithara snorted. At that time Catelyne walked in, “Hello Catelyne.” Mithara grumbled, taking a seat with Catelyne Catrella and Slithengar. Catelyne eyed Catrella curiously. “Somethin’s different about ye…” She turned her glance to Slithengar. “Aye, hello Slithengar.”<br/><br/>An awkward silence fell onto the table again. Slithengar sat there for a couple minutes and began to drum on the table. Catrella almost yelled, “oh do, lease stop that.” Slithengar stopped drumming the table and sighed. Slithengar glanced casually at Catrella then back at the table. “Is there something you would like to say?”<br/><br/>Slithengar shook his head. “Uh.. No…”<br/><br/>She looked down, “Sorry, I just see you seeing you look at me.” Slithengar folded his arms. “I can’t help it… Oh… That sounded bad worse than how I meant it.” Catelyne sighed as she rested her chin on the palm of her right hand, balancing her elbow on the table.<br/><br/>“What do you mean you can’t help it? Is there something wrong with me?”<br/><br/>“No.”<br/><br/>Mithara and Catelyne said similar things almost at the same time. “He thinks you are pretty dar.” “He thinks yer cute.” Slithengar glared at Mith. “I’m amazed you hadn’t noticed yet.” She smiled at Slithengar as he covered his face. Catelyn smirked at Slithengar and Catrella blushed.<br/><br/>Catrella looked down, “I’m sorry. I think I should go see about Tol barad or something.” She left and slithengar turned to Mithara and sighed. “Nice going moron. I don’t need help with personal affairs.” <br/><br/>Mith threw her hands in the air, “Like you would have ever admitted anything without me, dear. Besides, she blushed. It’s a good sign.”<br/><br/>Catelyne chuckled softly at Slithengar, “Ye made it pretty obvious.”<br/><br/>“She’s embarrassed…”<br/><br/>“Mhm, which is good.”<br/><br/>“No.”<br/><br/>“Besides, the “I can’t help it”, dug yourself right into the ground. Mithara raised a brow, “oh, the man knows more about ladies than the girls do, hm?” Catelyne sighed, “He is really cluseless.” She stifled back a laugh. Slithengar stared at the table, “Whatever.”<br/><br/>Slithengar took a deep sigh, “Maybe next time you can avoid opening your mouth.” <br/><br/>“That was blown the instant you spoke, dear. I just kept the awkwardness from being drawn out.” Catelyne reached over to pat Slithengar on the shoulder but quickly retracted her hand. “Don’t worry so much, Mithara’s right. It was a good sign…”<br/><br/>“Good sign or not… She is being courted by that moron Wolfgaar, no point in things getting complicated.”<br/><br/>Mithara asked, “….Isn’t Wolfgaar old?” Slithengar shrugged, and catelyne giggled. “Ye shouldn’t just give up, I think ye stand a better chance.”<br/><br/>“Exactly, you are much preferable to Wolf.”<br/><br/>Slithengar groaned. “You sound like that night elf I talked to last night.”<br/><br/>Catelyne made an outburst of sarcasm. “Ye talked to someone?!”<br/><br/><br/>Slithengar ignored her sarcasm. “Yea…”<br/><br/>“Not like ye…. Interestin’.” <br/><br/>“Some night elf last night… Kept insisting on that I find love.” He shrugged, “I said if I die alone, then it happens.”<br/><br/>“Ye shouldn’t be like tha’”<br/><br/>“Then ye’d be no better than the rest of the “sad sods” back in Archerus.”<br/><br/>“Then maybe I’m not. But I’ve been like this my whole life.”<br/><br/>Catelyne gave a small wave, “I’m gonna go work on some archaeology projects… See you later.”

Slithengar started to zone out in thought. “I’ve had enough excitement about love… Keeps coming up, especially over the last couple days.” <br/><br/>Mithara nodded. “Better than trauma I suppose.” Slithengar shrugged and decided to go sit outside. <br/><br/>A couple hours later Catrella returned to the Recluse and looked about. She came and sat diagonally to Slithengar. He looked up from his deep thought and smiled. <br/><br/>“Um, I’m just waiting for the call to Tol Barad in here.” Slithengar nodded. “Mitahra was wrong, wasn’t she?”<br/> <br/>Slithengar looked at the table, “Wrong how?”<br/><br/>She fiddled with her hands, “I mean she was wrong about you swooning over me?” Slithengar shook his head, “I’m afraid not…”<br/><br/>“But you are a death knight. I thought they couldn’t love.”<br/><br/>Slithengar sighed, “Maybe… Maybe not. … I didn’t mean for… You… To get embarrassed. Complicated… I don’t know.”<br/><br/>“I mean thinking I am pretty doesn’t mean you want to be moer than friends, correct?”<br/><br/>Slithengar nodded slowly, “…I… Just… Don’t know what to say.”<br/><br/>Catrella looked down. “You could say Mithara was wrong.”<br/><br/>“This is why… I don’t talk to people about this… Things get complicated.”<br/><br/>“I understand. I think I shall leave now.” Slithengar closed his eyes and nodded.<br/><br/>More time seemed to slip by and Catelyne returned to find the Recluse bustling with activity. “So, ye seen Cat after she rushed off?”<br/><br/>“I had a word with her before Tol Barad.”<br/><br/>She raised a brow smiling. “Oh? And what did she say?”<br/><br/>Slithengar sighed and frowned, “She wanted to know if Mithara was wrong. .. I don’t know who is more uncomfortable, me or her.” <br/><br/>“What’s wrong with ye thinkin’ she is cute? I noticed it too… Did mention it..”<br/><br/>“She’s with that Wolfgaar person… besides, we are opposites.”<br/><br/>“Did she specifically tell you that they were courting?”<br/><br/>“They were holding each other in their arms… That count? Not to mention that someone said that they were.” He stopped for a moment. “I wasn’t sure how to respond to, “You area death knight, I thought they couldn’t love. Wish this would all blow over… Never that easy though.”<br/><br/>‘Ye know… Bein a death knight doesn’t mean ye can’t love… Look at me, I have a few suitors trying to court me. Believe it or not.”<br/><br/>“Maybe I’ve spent my whole life…” He stopped to think, and look around at the people at the table. “I uh… Maybe we’ll talk later.”<br/><br/>He got up and whispered in her year, “I’ll be at the Slaughtered Lamb.” She nodded and began a conversation with a dwarf there.<br/><br/>A few minutes passed and Catelyne joined Slithengar on the stone benches outside of the Slaughtered Lamb. “So, ye were sayin’?”<br/><br/>“I’ve spent my whole life… Staying away from…. I … maybe I convinced myself that I don’t need it and it doesn’t exist.” <br/><br/>She nodded, “It does exist fer out kind… Shocking I know who could love a death knight right? But I believe it is possible.” She smiled, “Doesn’t surprise me you convinced yourself you don’t need it.”<br/><br/>Slithengar closed his eyes, “She seems happy with Wolfgaar, and I don’t want to hurt her…” He sighed. “Why am I all confused now?”<br/><br/>“Ye fit that sort o type. Honestly, I don’t think you would hurt her. Besides, isn’t Wolfgaar really old? Ancient even?”<br/><br/>“Not physically … maybe hurt wasn’t the right word..”<br/><br/>She shrugged. “Still old, heh. “Yer confused because yer not used to dealin with sort o thing I guess.”<br/><br/>“I still don’t think I’m capable. I just can’t be open about everything.”<br/><br/>She raised a brow, “Think ye just contradicted yourself there. Ye were open about your feelings, no? Ye can be open in your own way.”<br/><br/>Slithengar looked down at the ground. “To you… Not to her…. Talking to her is much different. I… I’m not sure why I uh “like” her.. just..do..”<br/><br/>She laughed softly, “Aye, I understand that well enough. Feelings are funny things I’ve found. Before my freedom, I didn’t really have them, I knew them even feignede them. But they weren't genuine. Now that they are solid and real, they’re pretty much unexplainable.”<br/><br/>“There is nothing I can do about it. Might as well let life go. I’ve already said it twice before. If I die alone, then it was meant to happen.” Catelyne pointed a finger at his chest leaning over and tapping it gently, “I bet that there tells a different tale.”

<br/>Slithengar put a hand over his chest. “It may beat at a slower pace, but we still have feelings. I think there is somethin’ you can do about it.” Slithengar stared at the ground. “What’s that?”<br/> <br/>“Try the courtin’ game and see what happens with her.”<br/><br/>“What?” She sighed, “I can ask. Just because you saw em holdin’ arms or whatever the other day, don’t mean they’re involved.”<br/><br/>“She will probably suspect you are up to something.” She smirked slyly. <br/><br/>“We are opposites.<br/><br/>She shrugged, “Well if you don’t want me too. “ She thought for a moment. “Aye, but that does not mean you can’t try yer hand at love.”<br/><br/>Slithengar gazed at the ground. “She is caring… thoughtful… involved with the Light… I on the other hand…”<br/><br/>She smiled, “I don’t think that would matter much to Catrella.”<br/><br/>“It matters to me.”<br/><br/>“Why?”<br/><br/>“Doesn’t that seem strange. “Light’ and “Darkness” together?” <br/><br/>“Look at me. I’m fightnin’ darkness with darkness in an order of the Light. The way we do things aren’t set in stone. When we have the free will to choose.”<br/><br/>“I just hope that fool Wolfgaar doesn’t hurt her. There is something about him I don’t like. And it’s not that “noble” crap.” <br/><br/>She laughed, “I don’t like his noble rubbish really. Don’t really know him myself though. Ye always have a choice, Slithengar, Yer not “meant” to do this or “destined” to be like that. All comes down to the simple choice you’ve made.”<br/><br/>“When I was off fighting, what was he doing? Sipping wine? Pft, Honorable Nobles.”<br/><br/>She shrugged, “Most of them are pretty spoiled.” <br/><br/>“Rhumple described that...Two females could be together, he nearly threw up.” <br/><br/>She smirked. “That would have been a laugh.”<br/><br/>“Not to mention he was taking advice from him, who tries to court someone but then takes bad advice? Even I know to not ask someone if they have an internal parasite.”<br/><br/>She nodded and giggle. “Oh dear, not Rhumple the “Love Doctor.” Rubbish. …. We’ll see how that goes, won’t we? Not sayin’ ye can’t try to get closer to her.”<br/><br/>Slithengar nodded. “I probably shouldn’t push it… I don’t want to scare her away.”<br/><br/>“By all means, I’d rather have you closer to her than Wolfgaar. Seein’ as I don’t really know him.”<br/><br/>“You don’t really know me either.”<br/><br/>“Know ye well enough to judge your character. Really doubt ye will scare anyone. Especially Catrella. And that ye don’t mean to scare of course.”

“Can I blame Gentyl? She is the one who got me worried about this in the first place.”<br/><br/>“Oh?”<br/><br/>“A few days ago, I may have had more to drink than I should have. I spouted a few words, that involved lovely and Catrella. She goes off and tells her, everything has been getting weirder ever since.”<br/><br/>“Sounds unlike Gentyl though…”<br/><br/>“I might have… Told Gentyl… To tell her.”<br/><br/>She sighed, “That might have made things a bit odd. Aye.”<br/><br/>“There is no denying it… or avoiding the truth. It may have been for the best if nothing was said.”<br/><br/>“Aye”<br/><br/>“I think Catrella really likes Wolfgaar… I should have never said anything.” <br/><br/>She gets up, “Well, I think she might like you as well, think you should try and get closer to her. Just try to be more positive, please? If not for yourself, for her.”<br/><br/>“I do not think it is a good idea …. I should keep my distance.”<br/><br/>She sighed, “Then be that way then. But don’t expect it to get better that way. If I can help ye in anyway, remember what I told ye about choices. I’ll see ye later perhaps. Just remember that ye don’t always have to be alone.”<br/><br/>“But if it happens… Then it happens.”<br/><br/>Later on in the evening Slithengar sat in the recluse, letting this day of “Love” roll around in his head. He looked around to see what time it was. “Guess, I’ll go to the.. Sermon.” Slithengar sat at the Gazebo, as a crowd of people gathered, mostly on the left side. Slithengar listened to the best of his ability and near the end he accidentally let a question slip he did not mean too. He shrugged at the answer disappointed. <br/><br/>People stayed around talking and Slithengar went to the shore bank and stared out onto the pond. As he walked back Catelyne gave him a look of “Get me out of this situation.” He approached her and a few others, “Uh… Catelyne, think I can speak to you for a moment?” <br/><br/>“Certainly, If you’ll excuse me.” Slithengar and Catelyne walked a little over earshot from the others. “What is it?”<br/><br/>Slithengar folded his arms, “It probably wouldn’t be a good idea to tell Catrella anything about our conversation earlier…”<br/><br/>“I wasn’t planning on telling her… Whatever said between me and you. Stays between us.<br/><br/>“Okay… I just wanted to be sure.”<br/><br/>She nods, “Of course I wouldn’t do that to a friend unless I had their consent.” Slithengar turned faced away from Catelyne. <br/><br/>“I’ll probably stay lonely, but I know she will more than likely be happy. That is what matters most.”<br/><br/>“Slith…” He could feel her frown sting into his back. She put a hand on his shoulder, but withdrew it quickly. “Ye matter too.”<br/><br/>Slithengar said nothing and walked off shaking his head.
