We were each chosen based on our age and ability, highet and size. Mainly to test the various effects on the subject until the perfect one emerged. Though each subject that underwent the treatment was unchanged or slightly different in appearance, only a few seemed to gain anything from the absorption. I myself felt a soft change in my strength, some spells that would take time to cast now came to complete in seconds. Rose, from what I could tell at the time, had no changes on her at all. At least not on the surface at the time and that may have been because of her age and behavior.”<br/><br/>Wulfgrin smirked slightly at that. “Sounds like her. You mentioned the process required a fallen demon, how did they plan to merge the two powers?”<br/><br/>Taking a moment to reply Kera continued. “It was a type of possession, not the kind you hear a lot about these days, there were precautions taken. A team of demon hunters would be sent out to collect a specimen, defeat it and send it to the lab for the experiment. Once there, Sarken would begin a binding ritual to insure the demon could not force it’s will onto anyone should it still be alive. Once the spells and curses were in place a test subject would be sent in. Once in place a priest would perform a spell on the demon turning it into a cloud of shadow which the subject would then inhale. The process after would take between four to six hours before the first signs of change took place. After eight hours, if nothing changed a spell would then be cast to remove the demonic essence from the subject. This experiment went on for a few months and it wasn’t until the twelfth test that a problem occurred.” She said as her gaze turned to Faruzia who sat in the corner with her voidwalker.<br/><br/>Wulfgrin followed her gaze to the warlock. “What is wrong? Do you know her?”<br/><br/>Nodding slowly she spoke quietly. “I have not met her before today, but her actions during the fight have me curious. She calls her voidwalk ‘father’ and the scars on her cheeks, burns I take it? There was a story about a young girl, the daughter of a demon hunting family who would hunt demons together. On one particular mission, the demon they were sent to capture overpowered them and she lost her parents in the fight, both lost to the void with the demon. The families name was Tearius and the daughters name was Faruzia.”<br/><br/>Wulfgrin puffed on his pipe as he looked at Faruzia. “Faruzia Tearius, though she tends to go by the nickname Frozentears. She’s made no mention of this story to any of us and she really only joined us for the gold I offered. Sad to lose a family in such a manner, but what does she have to do with anything?”<br/><br/>Kera looked down. ”It was her family that was sent to collect the demons for the experiment and she was also the tenth test subject. When they failed at collecting the twelfth demon, it was still alive when it was sent. While it may not have been the intention to send it anywhere other than to banish it, it was sent to a test subject. However, the twelfth subject did not receive it and another that for whatever reason was on the list, intercepted it. Celesa was the thirteenth and last subject.”<br/><br/>Kera balled her fist and slammed it onto the desk they sat at. Standing, she turned to lean on the desk.<br/><br/>“We didn’t know, no one knew what had happened until it was too late. Celesa became deathly sick several hours after the possession. We thought she was just sick and tried to care for her as best as we could, but nothing we did worked. Rose was frantic and would not stop crying as her best friend, her sister lay helpless in bed. After all we did failed, father and I decided to go to the city and call on the aid of a skilled doctor to help us. Leaving mother and Rose behind to watch Celesa, we set out. I only wish I had stayed, maybe I could have prevented what happened after we left.” Kera said pausing to wipe a few tears away.<br/><br/>Regaining her composer she continued. “While we were away Celesa’s condition worsened and she was getting weaker by the minute. She would last another hour before she stopped breathing. Our mother began to panic and did everything she could to revive her, she worked hard for five minutes and just when she thought she had failed, Celesa took a breath again. We don’t know for sure what happened next, but sometime during this moment, Rose walked into the room. What she saw confused and enraged her. All she saw was the body of her sister and her mother pounding on her chest. She didn’t know she was trying to bring her back and reacted to what she saw. Her rage fueled her untrained powers and the house erupted in flame. From outside we saw at a distance the flames of our house and as we reached it we saw Rose sitting on the steps of the house, flames behind her, crying. She kept saying how sorry she was and asked if they would be ok. We tried several times to go into the house, but the flames were too intense, there was nothing we could do.

In the morning when the flames finally died out, we recovered the body of our mother, but could not find Celesa anywhere. It was assumed the fire burned everything and there was nothing left to recover. Father was expressionless for days and would not even look at Rose. He never returned to work either, which probably saved his life as Sarken had called into action an assassin. The fire had threated to expose the experiment and he could not afford to lose what research he did manage to gain. The assassin was sent out to kill the families involved in the experiment as well as the children. Nothing was to be left alive. Once we had learned of this, father moved Rose into the city and placed her in the care of the orphanage. We would go our separate ways to lessen the chance we were found together and we would train to become stronger. To this day I do not know where father went or if he is even still alive. I traveled to the Dark Portal in hopes to find a way to use it, but I was followed by Sarken and in our fight I was still not strong enough to defeat him. At the same time your clan arrived in the middle of our fight and I had fled thinking you were sent to aid him. In order to protect his secrets, he killed your clan to prevent witnesses from interfering. Somehow you lived.”<br/><br/>Wulfgrin bit hard onto his pipe at the memory of his fallen clan. Placing a hand on MeatBags head, he slowly stroked the wolf which brought him comfort.<br/><br/>Kera hesitated but continued. “After the battle, I fled far north and found refuge in a very unlikely place, the blood elves just north of the Eastern Plaguelands took me in and from them I continued my studies. As the years passed I would send out a scout to keep track of Rose as she grew within the orphanage. One of the reports I got told me of the Stonemasons rebellion and that Rose joined them in order to fill a need to belong to something. Later they would be called the Defias. At that time I lost track of Rose and her movements, though reports of Defias attacks spread throughout the kingdom. Another report was brought to me during this time, one that caused me to leave the safety of the Elves. The report said there was a sighting of a young girl, no more than five, was seen traveling the roads in Stranglethorn. The description that was given fit the profile of Celesa and I had to see for myself. I tracker her down to a ruined troll camp in the northern parts of Stranglethorn. When I arrived, she seemed to be waiting for me, smiling a smile that sent a chill down my spine. It had been ten years at least, yet her body was unchanged in age. Burns covered her body that she received from the fire Rose had caused, but save for that, nothing was different. <br/><br/>She begged me to come closer, but I kept my distance as she explained her story. The night of the fire we had thought she was very sick, but she had told me that was not the case. The demon that was meant to be sent to the twelfth child was sent to her, alive. She was battling the demon within, fighting to keep it from taking her. She fought so hard and through a power she did not know she had, she defeated the demon and took possession of it instead. The victorious, her young body could not handle the strain of the fight and died. Though through a miracle of sorts, she was brought back by our mother only to be moments later surrounded by fire. There was only seconds to find a way to defend herself from the flames and using her new powers she was able to create shield that protected most of her body. There was nothing she could do for our mother and escaped through the window. She didn’t know what happened after, but she awoke later in the forests of Duskwood. There she spent her time learning her new abilities and hoped to one day return home. During her time in Duskwood she learned about what Sarken and the nobles had done and that though she aged mentally, her body did not. She then realized there was no chance to ever go home and live normally which made her furious. She then turned that fury into a thought of revenge and wanted to see all those involved killed. She offered me a chance to join her in this revenge and said she would do everything that was done to us. I told her I would seek out Sarken and end his life, but I would not go after families. This upset her and claimed that if I was not going to help her, I was an obstacle to be removed and attacked me. The spell she launched at me was one I had never seen before and had no defense for. It had the form of all three of the schools of arcane as well as fel magic that increased its strength. Through sheer luck she had missed me and obliterated the hill behind me. Not giving her a second chance, I fled as fast as I could. I knew then I had to find Rose at all cost before she did, but I had no idea where to look. That is, until I heard about Moonbrook.”

Wulfgrin nodded at that. “And that is where we come in. We had heard about your sister and my hate for you drove me to find her and find her I did. The town was ablaze when I arrived and I found Rose stumbling away from the nearby pond. She seemed confused and weak, so I decided to take her to safety. I left her in the care of Sarken not knowing his past and that was my own failing. Rose still had no idea who he was or what had happened in Moonbrook. What I was able to find out from survivors was she had attacked a priest after setting the school on fire. With his dying breath the priest attempted to mind control her to get her away, but instead scrambled her memories. She remembers joining the Defias, but the reasons were different or so she thought. What you see now is a new Rose, what she was before was a monster and before the priest, she was just as bad as any of the Defias. She has a fresh start now and I worry about what she will do when you tell her what you told me. She is more mature now, but as you saw her rage is still there.”<br/><br/>Kera nodded looking back to Rose who was beginning to stir. “You let me worry about that. She will need us to keep her strong through this. It won’t be easy for her to hear she killed her mother and may have to kill her beloved younger sister now. For now, gather your people and rest. When we are ready we will need to move to intercept Celesa before she begins her hunt for the nobles. We will need everyone here at their best if we are to face her, she is stronger than anything known and we know nothing of her powers. Together we may stand a better chance.”<br/><br/>With that Kera stood and walked over to Rose. Kneeling beside her she woke her gently and began to speak to her.<br/> <br/>Wulfgrin watched with concern. There was a feeling of dread that could be felt in the room, death lingered in the air and it could be seen on those present. The war of the sisters was to begin soon and many in this room would not survive.

((Part 9))<br/><br/>The path traveled on can be the definition of different things depending on who travels on it. Every person at one time or another finds themselves on a path that can be the most important thing they have ever traveled on in their lives. The path of redemption, of revenge, a new beginning or the end of a journey; each one different for those on their own path. No matter the path, the story for each one is unique to the one on that path. On this path, eleven travelers journey towards the end of their story, but perhaps the beginning of a new one.<br/><br/><span class="underline">Lorix and Denava</span><br/><br/>“You’ve been staring at me like that ever since we left the tower. Something on your mind?” Lorix said annoyed.<br/><br/>Denava sat up straight on her mount surprised she had been noticed. Waving her hand she said “No no, I just um…” She started to say, but bit her lip. Though she tried hard, she could not help but continue. “What happened to you? I mean, I haven’t seen you for a few years now and what they are saying about you can’t be true. I trained hard with father so I could join you in the front, but when I asked about you, they listed you as a deserter. They nearly threw me out just for being your sister. They weren’t right were they? You didn’t abandon your post?”<br/><br/>Lorix looked back at Denava and frowned. He reached into his saddlebag and pulled out a flask. Taking a long drink from it he slowly nodded.<br/><br/>“It’s true, I did leave my post. If I hadn’t, I would be just as dead as the rest of my platoon. Some uppity prick of an officer decided to leave me with newly trained recruits to hold an indefensible hole in the ground while he sat on his rear somewhere in safety. Claiming he had to plan the next attack. I knew better though, I knew all he was doing was sitting in his chair drinking himself into oblivion. I did what I could with what I had, but Warsong Gulch is no place for green troops and the Horde proved that to us time and time again. We stood no chance and every man in my unit was slaughtered with little effort. I was left for dead, but I watched as they did unspeakable things to my men. Before leaving, they took the flag of our regiment and covered it in the blood of our fallen, a token of their victory. Rather than stay, I left for I knew nothing would change. They would fix me up and then toss me back in the front with yet another fresh platoon waiting to be killed off.”<br/><br/>Denava watched as he took several more drinks from his flask. Emptying the flask, Lorix grumbled as he threw it onto the ground. <br/><br/>“I couldn’t bear to see more men die like mine did, so I fled. I tried to get to Booty Bay, but I got as far as Westfall. Still weak from my injuries I took refuge in the barn of a farmhouse. It didn’t take long before the family there discovered me, but rather than turn me into the local militia, they took me in and cared for my wounds. I stayed with them for several weeks until my wounds were healed. I had planned to leave, but I felt more at peace there than I had in much of my life and with their approval, I stayed to help around the farm.”<br/><br/>He paused for some time reflecting on his thoughts. After a few minutes he shifted uncomfortably in his saddle continuing.<br/><br/>“Things were good for a time; the boy was a delight and eager to learn about military life. His mother, a lovely lady herself, lost her husband to bandits and was left to tend the farm alone. I worked hard daily, helping whenever I could, but I could never replace what they had lost. A few months passed and for a time, I was happy. The world however, seemed displeased with my happiness and had other plans. I never saw it coming and before I could do anything it was too late. The Defias had begun forcing people from their land and those that stayed were killed or forced to work in the mines. The boy and his mother were ones that refused to leave. I was away gathering supplies for the stables when I came to see the house in flames and Defias thugs leading them away. I tried to fight them, but their numbers were too great. Again, I was left for dead, but by a different enemy and the loss was not a flag or token of war, but a loving family that I came to love myself. I vowed that when I was strong enough I would save them from the mines and working with this Dwarf will bring me to that goal.”<br/><br/>Denava rode up next to her brother and smiled.<br/><br/>“Then I will help you as well. Once we are done with this task I give my word, we will rescue them together. We may not serve in the same unit, but we can shake the foundations of the Defias and they will know they cannot mess with our family and walk away unscathed.”<br/>Lorix nodded and smiled back to Denava. “Then we had better hurry this little adventure along. I don’t want to keep them waiting any longer.” He said spurring his mount forward.

<span class="underline">Faruzia, Korena and Gorexin</span><br/><br/>Faruzia rode in silence with her imp Pipyap sitting on her shoulder. As she moved on, she stared at the two elves that were ahead following closely to Roses sister. Moving closer to them she drew their attention causing them to slow beside her.<br/><br/>Looking at the both of them Faruzia motioned to speak, but Pipyap spoke first. “So what’s your story?” He spoke in a rude tone granting him a fiery glare from Faruzia.<br/><br/>Not wanting her wrath, he backed off. “I-err, um, right I’ll be going then.” He said in a puff of smoke vanishing into nothing.<br/><br/>Turning her attention back to the elves she shook her head. “Despite his rude tone, his question is mine as well. What is your purpose here?”<br/><br/>Korena smiled slightly. “My brother and I serve the Grenwall family. Currently we follow Kera.”<br/><br/>Nodding, Faruzia smirked as she spoke. “You’re slaves then?”<br/><br/>Korena frowned at that and shook her head. “No, we serve her because we owe her our lives. She escaped into our lands to run from her own danger only to find the land she ran to was itself in peril. Our village was under attack by scourge invaders and many of our kin were killed in the assault. None of my people were trained soldiers and very few knew the arts so our defenses did not last long. As the final attack began, we had lost all hope and braced ourselves for the final outcome.”<br/><br/>She paused a moment to look towards Kera and smiled. “That is when we saw a wall of ice appear before us dividing the survivors and the attacking undead. We could not see through the ice, but we could hear the battle on the other side. Once the fighting ended, the wall came down and all of the undead had been defeated. Kera herself sat against a tree holding a wound in her side. As she passed out, we took her to a secure building and our best healers went to work on her.”<br/><br/>“And the fact she was human did not bother you?” Faruzia asked.<br/><br/>“Not at all, she saved what remained of our village by putting her own life on the line and she did not even know us. We swore that we would repay her kindness by any means. We later found that what she sought was knowledge, anything that could help her further her own abilities. We showed her what we knew and in return she taught many of us what she knew. I learned I had a strong connection to fire and she said in many ways I reminded her of her sister.”<br/><br/>Faruzia sighed at that. “Yeah, a strong connection to fire, I know that already. You blew us through a wall remember?”<br/><br/>Korena giggled softly. “Yes and I am sorry about that, but we could not have you interfering. I was only doing as I was told. What about you? Why are you here?”<br/><br/>Faruzia looked down at her mount. “When we first started all I wanted was money. Since we left the tower I feel as though there is something much more here than just money. My parents met their end at the hands of a powerful demon and I believe if I stay on this path I’ll know more about him.”<br/><br/>Korena nodded. “What will you do if you find it? Sometimes what you seek is not the answer you want.”<br/><br/>She turned back to Korena. “I Will kill it. Because of that damned demon, my life, my family is in ruins. Before I do, I have to know how it escaped the banishment my parents sacrificed their lives to put it in.”<br/><br/>Gorexin placed a hand on Korena drawing her attention. Whispering in her ear, he spoke. “She doesn’t know…”<br/><br/>Hearing it, Faruzia interrupted. “Know what? What do you know?”<br/><br/>Looking back to her, Korena smiled. “Oh, it’s nothing. I do believe though if we continue together on this path you will find the answers you seek. For now, stay focused and do not let your emotions take control.”<br/><br/>Faruzia nodded slowly and let her mount slow letting the elves move forward.

<span class="underline">Wulfgrin, Kera and Rose</span><br/><br/>“She’s been taking this a little too well.” Wulfgrin said riding beside Kera.<br/><br/>Looking towards Rose, Kera frowned slightly.<br/><br/>“It will take time for it all to sink in. I still don't know what kind of damage was done to her mind by the priest. Her memories being scrambled were just part of problem. She remembers bits and pieces, but to not know anything about her family and turning her personality completely around like he did, it’s like he was trying to do something much more than control her.”<br/><br/>Wulfgrin nodded at that. “It was as though he was trying to reprogram her mind for a different purpose. Controlling her only lasts until the spell ended, but he was trying to make it last long after it ended. The question is though, will what he did last on her or will we see her go back to her old ways?”<br/><br/>Kera stared at the ground as they continued. “While I was searching for her, the scouts I sent out would return with reports of her actions while with the Defias. The things she did Wulf…” She pauses a moment turning to Wulfgrin. “…We can’t let her slip back. Right now she barely knows who I am and is even less certain of Celesa. What she was before, even I don’t know who she turned into. I need you to do something for me.” Kera said <br/><br/>“If this fight starts to go poorly for us, I need you to take Rose away and care for her. Right now she’s known you longer than any of us and you were the first person she met after Moonbrook that was kind to her. I need you to watch over her and guide her on the right path so she never slips.”<br/><br/>Wulfgrin hesitated, but could see the concerned look in Keras eyes. “I can do as you ask. I will do my best to mentor her, but what will you do?”<br/><br/>“Should we survive this fight I plan to track down the nobles who signed off on the experiment order. It is rumored that the order came from a sole person and was passed down to the nobles with promise of riches upon their signature. Whoever this person was, they are one who started all of this and watched from the shadows during its progression. I will hunt this person down.” Kera said gripping the horses’ reins tighter.<br/><br/>Wulfgrin watched her carefully and in a calm voice spoke. “Has there been any word as to what this person looks like?”<br/><br/>Shaking her head she turned back to Wulf. “As far as I know so far no one has seen him or if he is even indeed a ‘He’ or ‘She’. They have been very cautious to keep themselves hidden.”<br/><br/>Wulfgrin looking forward again smiled slightly. “A mystery to solve later then. We should focus on what is to come, I am sure we will have our hands full just trying to stay alive.”

<span class="underline">Sheknee, Protius and Celesa</span><br/><br/>“What the hell are you looking at old fool?” Sheknee sneered as he removed the final bandages covering the wounds received from his lashing by Celesa. Tossing the wrappings aside he could feel the gaze of the old priest. “Well? Speak up!”<br/><br/>Protius smiled “If I were you, I would keep my voice down. You wouldn’t want to upset your master again would you?” He said smiling knowing that title stung Sheknee.<br/><br/>Gritting his teeth he moved to say something, but his eyes shifted over to Celesa who sat alone in the open in the field before them. Watching her, he sat down again in an annoyed huff. Shifting his gaze back to Protius he sat silently.<br/><br/>“No, I didn’t think so. That’s a good dog.” Protius said.<br/><br/>Ignoring the insult, Sheknee looked towards Celesa again. “What are we doing here anyway? Bringing me back to life and granting me power only to have me hiding in the shadows like a coward. You at least are her right hand and you are sat down like me. Yet you don’t seem to care.”<br/><br/>Protius also watched Celesa in a calm gaze. “That is because I do what I am told. Our purpose is only to be support when she calls for it. We have the element of surprise with us. Our foe is unaware of my presence and believes you to be dead and those factors will come in handy. We will sit here until called, but I believe that will never happen. She is far more capable is handling them on her own, we would just get in the way.”<br/><br/>Shaking his head, Sheknee stabbed the ground with his sword out of boredom. “Whatever, as long as I get to repay her dear sister. The moment I see her I may just reintroduce myself.” He said smirking.<br/><br/>Turning quickly, Protius grabbed Sheknees armored collar. “You will do no such thing! If we are called at all it will be to deal with the companions accompanying her sisters and no one else. You make any move against them and I will kill you myself.”<br/><br/>Sheknee angrily pulled away from Protius, swatting away his hand. “Your little master may have given me pain that I have never felt before reminding me that there are still things even I can fear. You however, I do not fear and you had best remember that. This arrangement is only temporary and the very moment I am free from her shadow I will come for you.” He said sitting down again.<br/><br/>Still standing, Protius smiled slightly. “Then on that day I will show you what this crusty old priest can do. You will then underst…” Stopping his sentence, Protius turned quickly towards Celesa. He could feel the sudden increase of power and then he could see them in the distance.<br/> <br/>“The sisters have arrived…” He said softly.<br/><br/>(( And this is it for now. I believe for what I want to do, there will be two more parts to finish it. As I expect this post to fade away, I will most likely post those in a different post. I hope you like what I have so far and I hope I explained what was in my head correctly heh.))

((Part 10))<br/><br/>“What is it that defines a hero? Is it the actions they take to protect the innocent, is it the tragic stories of their past that propels them to fight evil? Who is it that decides who or what is evil? I have sat here trying to figure that out, which am I? Am I the hero or the villain?<br/><br/>I come from a tragic background, one quite terrible. I was born with great potential and great power, but it was cut short by the sadistic experiments of a scientist. Despite his efforts, I survived only to be attacked again by one I trusted, one I loved. At the cost of my mother’s life I survived. I spent years in exile, hiding from those that hurt me until I was strong enough and plotted to strike back.<br/><br/>I couldn’t do it alone so I asked another I trusted and she too would betray me. Cursed, burned, betrayed and I even died only to be reborn as what I am today. I want revenge for what happened to me, I want to set right the wrongs done to us, but the betrayers stand before me and claim me the villain?”<br/><br/>Celesa stared at the group before her, watching each closely. Her eyes focused onto her sisters Kera and Rose. Standing, she continued.<br/><br/>“Me, a villain? What gives you the right to claim me so? I only seek out those responsible for Sarkens experiments; I will make them suffer as we have, as I have.”<br/><br/>Kera stepped forward. “What you want will bring the whole of Stormwind on you. There is no need to do such things, Sarken is dead, the experiments cannot continue.”<br/><br/>“IT’S NOT ENOUGH! Entire families were killed to cover up the experiment and its failure. You don’t know what I have been through, the pain I have suffered to get this far. You stand there so confident in yourselves that your way is right. What I will do will show them they cannot do what they did and walk free without consequence.”<br/><br/>Rose stepped forward this time. “Celesa please, doing this will only make it wors…” she begins to say before an unseen force closes her mouth and lifts her from the ground. Lorix and Denava both draw their weapons to assist. <br/><br/>Celesa’s voice grew darker and boomed with dark power. “Tell those tin cans to back off or I will tear her head off and use it to make them into scrap metal!” she said without moving from her spot.<br/><br/>Kera waved them off and Celesa focused again on Rose.<br/><br/>“You, you do not get to speak to me murderer. You have no breath in my presence, not even to fill the lungs in your wretched body. You of all those here are more of a villain than I will ever be dubbed so. You killed our mother, burned me alive, ran from the safety of the city and joined a cause that reigned chaos throughout the land. Burned towns and murdered people on sight and you did so willingly and with joy. You have the nerve to stand there with those that call themselves heroes?”<br/><br/>Kera pleaded to Celesa. “She doesn’t remember anything. In Moonbrook, a priest entered her mind and altered it. Her memories are skewed, she didn’t even know about us until a few months ago. She didn’t even know about you or mother until today.”<br/><br/>“Well isn’t that convenient.” She said throwing Rose to the ground. “It still does not clear her of her past. I, nor will anyone she has affected will ever forgive her for what she has done. Nor will anyone forgive the rest of you. I do not even have to use my abilities to read your thoughts, they scream to me. Thieves, betrayers, deserters, murderers among all of you and you all face me for what I might do all the while overlooking your own sins. So I ask again, who decides who is the hero or villain? I could just as easily be here to stop all of you from harming others. Then I come out the hero, avenger of the fallen.” She said laughing to herself.<br/><br/>Then she stopped and sighed. “No, that’s not how it will turn out. We will fight, people will die and the winner will judge who the heroes and villains are. That is how the world works isn’t it? Why bother talking anymore when we all know how this will end? Then let’s get this started.”<br/><br/>Celesa stood firm and clenched her fists as an aura of darkness poured out around her as her power began to take shape. Her eyes turned black and she began to speak demonic words while forming arcane signs.<br/><br/>“This will be fun. So far only one has seen what I can do and now I can show the worl…” She is interrupted by a sharp pain in her back. The look of surprise is evident as the tip of the dagger explodes from her chest. Letting out a dark cry in agony, all of the power built up suddenly stops as she falls to the ground.<br/><br/>Kera, Rose and all of the others stare in disbelief and watch as a tall form emerges from the shadows and carefully removes the dagger from Celesas back.<br/><br/>((Continued))

Taking only a few steps he is frozen in place by the sound of laughter. Turning slowly he watches as Celesa picks herself up and faces him. The fatal wound he gave her healing quickly.<br/><br/>Celesa smiled and pointed at Vendo. “I’ve been waiting for you. I knew you were here, I could sense you. I just needed to lure you in and what better way to do that than a useless show of force. Sarkens assassin, we finally meet. A shadow killer of children and families. What, able fighters too much for you so you turn to killing the defenseless? You have much to answer for and I will start my revenge with you.”<br/><br/>Fearing for his life Vendo slips into the shadows to escape. Celesa smiles at this and vanishes before everyone’s eyes. In the shadows all that can be heard is quick movements and then silence. After a few moments of quiet the silence is shattered by painful screams. The screams grew louder in each moment until they too are brought to an end.<br/><br/>Once the screams stop, Celesa reappeared before the group and floating around her were what remained of Vendo. His body had been torn to pieces. Celesa tossed the floating remains on the ground and smiled.<br/><br/>“Now, shall we begin our dance?”<br/><br/>((Sorry this is taking so long to finish. I can never seem to stay focused on finishing it. Hopefully will be finished in two more parts.))

((Part 11))<br/><br/>He studied the area around him thoroughly, looked at every tree, stump and minor hill. Those around him were silent and still in shock at what had just happened to the assassin. He however, was more focused on how it happened which caused his mind to scream to him possibilities. He looked at the body parts and where they were and then judged the distance from where they originally were.<br/><br/>“It’s not her.” Lorix finally said breaking the silence.<br/><br/>Denava looked towards her brother noticing how focused he was. His many years of training and combat now coming to light. “What isn’t her?” she asked.<br/><br/>Pointing at Celesa, he moved his finger to her feet. “Look at the ground. When she moved to engage the assassin, the ground shifted in a pattern much larger than the size of the child. What we see before us is not her true form.”<br/><br/>Lorix looked back at the downed Rose and Kera who tried to wake her sister. Sighing at that he looked towards the others and his eyes caught Faruzia. “You, you’re a demon hunter right? Can you see or sense anything or whatever it is you do?” he said.<br/><br/>“I’m not a tracking hound; I can’t just sniff the air and magically know what the hell is in front of me.” Faruzia said in a growl. “But, to answer your question, I cannot see it clearly, but there is something of an aura around her like another form. It is not visible to the untrained and even I can barely see it.”<br/><br/>“So a shield of some sort?” He said looking back.<br/><br/>“No, this has more of a rough shape and moves as she moves. Like a larger shadow that mimics her movements.” Faruzia said.<br/><br/>He stared across the field for a few seconds thinking of what to do. He looked over at Denava who stood ready with her greatsword. A large weapon given to her from their father it was almost bigger than her, but she was handling it expertly.<br/> <br/>“Are you any good with that blade?” He asked<br/><br/>“As good as you, I can hold my own.” She said with confidence.<br/><br/>Lorix smiled at that. “Do you remember that trick we did to get on top of fathers barn? Think you could do it again?” he asked grinning.<br/><br/>Smiling she replied. “Yes and I remember a hard week of chores after nearly breaking his sword doing it. We were just kids then; the blade would break under the weight now.” She said looking at the sword.<br/><br/>Lorix nodded as he reached for his own greatsword from his horse and tossed it to Denava. “What about now? Think you could handle it?” he asked.<br/><br/>“It’s better, but it is still just one blade.” She said testing the sword.<br/><br/>Shaking his head he handed her their father’s blade and crossed them. “It won’t be just one, not if we use both.”<br/><br/>Denava laughed. “It takes most of my strength to carry one of these; you can’t expect me to carry two of them.”<br/><br/>“There is not time to dispute it. You need to find the strength right now to do it. The little one won’t wait much longer for us to do something.” He said nodding towards Celesa.<br/><br/>Picking up the second sword she grimaced at the weight and gave her brother an annoyed look.<br/><br/>Smiling, Lorix turned to the others.<br/><br/>“We have to be quick at this. Faruzia, I need you to do your best to track her movements if we are to take her head on. Denava and I will take the flanks while the two elves strike the center at ranged. Wulfgrin and Kera will stay with the downed Rose. We need to test what we are going up against and hit her with as much as we can. Stay focused and do not risk more than you can give.” He said as he tossed his shield away.<br/><br/>Pulling a single long bladed sword he stood ready looking to his sister with a different gaze than before. Her eyes met his and even though he said nothing, she could feel his fear. Smiling she tried to comfort him. “Are you ready for this?” she asked<br/><br/>“I’m never ready, but if you are prepared for everything, there is little room for surprise and where is the fun in that? You just be ready with those blades when I come.” He said smiling back. “Gorexin, Korena, get her attention if you please.” He said as he moved to the right of Celesa. As if on command Denava mirrored her brother by moving the left.<br/><br/>As both Lorix and Denava began to quicken their speed, Lorix watched as Korena powered a ball of fire while Gorexin launched several arrows down the field towards the waiting Celesa. As the arrows streaked through the air, Korena released her fireball and began charging another. Lorix watched as he increased his own speed to match Denavas own speed and showed little surprise as the arrows hit with no affect. As the fireball hit moments later he noticed a small shimmer of light that became visible seconds after the mages attack.<br/><br/>“No shield my as-“ He started to say before a cry from Faruzia filled the air.

“Lorix! At your right!” He heard her say as he turned in time to avoid an invisible strike. He couldn’t believe the speed that she moved; he hadn’t taken his eyes off of her for more than a second. Yet there she was, no more than feet away from him smiling. Rolling low he felt the air around him shift as the unseen strike missed him and struck the ground. Coming to his feet he continued his sprint, but shifted his movement towards Denava who was waiting to meet him with the twin swords crossed.<br/><br/>As Lorix ran to his sister, both Gorexin and Korena continued to attack despite the little affect they were having on Celesa who still stood watching with her arms behind her back as if taunting. Running at full speed now, Lorix charged at Denava with his eyes set on the swords. Denava gripped the hilts harder and braced herself for the impact as Lorix leapt towards her. Planting both feet at the center of the swords as his weight caused them to bow greatly. Looking towards the sky Lorix used the swords to propel him high into the air.<br/><br/>As he soared through the air above Celesa, he noticed her arms were glowing behind her back and as he sank closer he saw an unusual spell begin formed. At the moment another volley of arrows and fire struck Celesa who in the same instant responded by releasing the spell. Lorix tried to call out to the two elves, but they had little time to react.<br/><br/>The spell was ugly in form, but he could tell from the description Kera had given, it was one of Celesas strongest attacks. With no time to evade the attack, Gorexin moved in front of Korena to shield her from the blast. Lorix watched in horror as the blast blew through without stopping and incinerated both of them.<br/><br/>Cursing to himself Lorix focused on his descent towards Celesa from above. Changing from a slash attack to a downward thrust, he put as much strength into the attack as he could to strike hard at Celesas left shoulder. The shield protecting her became clearly visible as the power of the sword fought its resistance and broke through shattering it in a bright flash of light. The sword sunk deep into Celesas shoulder as Lorix pushed harder forcing the blade down until the sword guard prevented it from going farther.<br/><br/>Screaming in agony, Celesa flailed in a panicked manner striking Lorix hard causing him let go of the sword. Coming to his feet again, Lorix backed away from the wild strikes of Celesa and stood next to Denava again. <br/><br/>“There, that wasn’t too bad. I told you there was a damned shield.” He said taking one of the greatswords. Looking to his sister he gave a playful punch on her shoulder. “I told you that you could handle both of those swords”<br/><br/>Smiling, Denava started to say something, but all Lorix could hear was a familiar laughter coming from Celesa.<br/><br/>Across the field, Celesa was standing now, fully composed and smiling. “Like moths to a flame. Did you learn nothing from the assassin?” She said as she reached for the sword in her shoulder. Grimacing as she slowly pulled it out, tossing it to the ground. Both Lorix and Denava watched as the wound healed completely.<br/><br/>Lorix stood in shock. “This makes no sense. A shield and healing magic? Kera said nothing about this, what the hell is going on?”<br/><br/>Before he could even react, Celesa vanished before their eyes. Within seconds Lorix could hear the cries of Faruzia yelling for them to move, but it was far too late as the child appeared in front of Lorix. The only thing Lorix could do was push Denava clear of them. <br/><br/>Denava watched as Lorix was lifted into the air high above Celesas head. Lorix fought back as much as he could landing several blows, which healed as fast as he struck. Annoyed by the attacks, Celesa grabbed the sword arm and without hesitation, ripped the arm off from his body tossing both away.<br/><br/>“LORIX!” Denava screamed as her brother cried out in pain. Celesa still smiling turned him so that he was facing Denava. “Be brave now; do not show it to her. I know the truth of your true heart coward. It was not the Horde who threw you down and took you for dead, you hid from them. You stayed there motionless and watched your men die. You watched and were afraid to move. You fled from your responsibilities and hid from conflict. You’ve been a coward all of your life until today. Do not show her your weakness, be brave oh hollow tin man, be brave for her.” She whispered in his ear.<br/><br/>Lorix stopped struggling and looked at his sister. “Denava, I-“he started to say as Celesa snapped his neck tossing his lifeless body to the ground.<br/><br/>Denava sat stunned as she stared at her brothers’ body. Tears streamed down her cheeks as she grabbed her fathers’ sword as well as the sword from Lorix’s dead arm. With uncontrollable rage, she raised both swords; one in each hand and in a wild cry launched herself at Celesa.

((((()))))<br/><br/>As the battle continued between Denava and Celesa, far into the woods away from the eyes of those in combat sat Sheknee and Protius. Sheknee watched as the priest worked fast to cast as many healing spells as he could protecting his master.<br/> <br/>“This warrior is full of such fury. She is striking faster than I can heal. I don’t know why Lady Celesa doesn’t just kill her like that other worthless warrior.” Protius said completing more spells.<br/><br/>Sheknee watched carefully all of the priest movements, timing them. “She is playing with her. Feeding off of her grief. She seems to take great joy in causing pain, both physically and mentally. But it’s all a lie isn’t it? She isn’t invincible; you are protecting her in the shadows.”<br/><br/>“No, Lady Celesa was blessed with great power, but she is not able to prevent harm to herself. She can take many attacks herself, but to give the impression that she is immortal she needs me.” He said facing the battle.<br/><br/>Sheknee moved quietly behind the priest. “So that’s it? You are her secret weapon, a pocket healer?” he laughed.<br/><br/>“I am no weapon; I am her guardian and protector. I pulled her from the fire and watched her grow to the power she is now. You on the other hand are the weapon, the attack dog if you will. Though in this fight all you will get are the scraps left on the table.” Protius laughed as Sheknee moved closer to the priests exposed back.<br/><br/>“You know, I said something like that to the young masters’ sister Rose once. Only I said it after her betrayal was clear before me.” He said as he rammed his fist through the back of Protius.<br/><br/>Leaning closer he whispered in the priests ear. “You talk too much you know that? Telling the little brats’ weakness to the one person who has threatened to kill you. Now with your downfall I can watch as the oh so great child dies.”<br/><br/>Protius began to cough blood as his face twisted into a smile. “Y-you are a fool. You only kill yourself.” He said as his eyes began to glow white and a pillar of fire rained down the sky over him causing Sheknee to withdraw his hand from the priests’ body.<br/><br/>As Sheknee leapt back, he watched as Protius healed his own body and placed a shield around himself.<br/><br/>“Did you not think I could protect myself? I am a priest of the light, blessed by the holy order and a master of the ways of healing. Any attack you do to me I can mend fully. Come at me fool, when the master is done with them, she will rip you apart for your treachery.” He said<br/> <br/>Sheknee stood motionless with his hand still clenched in a fist and he smiled at the priest.<br/><br/>“It’s good that you are so skilled in all of that whatever you were talking about. I couldn’t pay attention as I was counting down. I do have to ask though, how good are you with explosives?” he said unclenching his fist revealing the pin of a goblin grenade.<br/><br/>“Crude little things these bombs, but easy to hide in ones hand. It was a long fuse, so I think you have about ten seconds to do whatever it is you do to heal that.” He said laughing as he watched Protius scream in panick as he clawed at his own body in a futile effort to get to the bomb.<br/><br/>With a defeated look on his face, Protius turned towards the area Celesa was fighting and tried call out to her in warning.<br/><br/>Before he could get out a single word of warning, he is reduced to a cloud of smoke and flesh as the bomb sealed in his body explodes.<br/><br/>Sheknee kicked pieces of the priest from his boot and he stared off into the field. Looking past Celesa and Denava as well as the others and looked only at Rose.<br/><br/>“I give you this present my little fallen rose. There will be a time for us later, for now enjoy this chance I give you. Do not disappoint me.”<br/> <br/>Sheknee gathered his gear and gave one last look across the field before walking off into the forest.<br/><br/>“I will be waiting for you my fallen rose.” He said vanishing into the darkness.

Fury, anger, sadness, she could feel all of this as the warrior struck wildly at her. Each blow came faster than the one before it, with such blinding speed that many would miss, but the ones that hit their mark were noticeably strong. What started as a game was becoming more serious as the fight went on. This warrior was not as strong as her brother before her, but the ferocity in her attacks made her unpredictable in her movements. These things did not bother Celesa as much as the fact that many of the wounds she did receive were not healing like they should.<br/><br/>Taking a moment to glance in the direction of her “allies” she noticed she could not feel the presence of neither Protious nor Sheknee. She could only assume they killed each other or Sheknee learned of her one weakness and quickly disposed of him. In time, she will find him and show him a pain ten times that of what he received in Duskwood. For now though she had to end this game much sooner than planned as her own healing could not keep up with the wounds she was gaining from this warrior.<br/><br/>Denava continued to throw herself at Celesa, swinging both great swords with unnatural strength. That strength however, was beginning to slowly fade away with each strike. Each time she would attack it took longer to recover for the next and the weight of the swords began to add strain to Denava’s untrained arms as the fighting style was something even vengeful fury could not overcome. This did not go unnoticed by Celesa as she increased her speed to make the tiring warrior fight harder to catch her. This continued until at last Denava stopped to breath and could no longer lift the heavy weapons.<br/><br/>Celesa smiled and moved forward to end this game when suddenly Denava threw one of the swords at her. Dodging easily, Celesa turned her attention back to Denava who now was only feet away with her remaining great sword high above her head. Using the last of her strength, she brought the sword down only to have it stopped just above Celesa’s head. Pushing as hard as she could she could not get the sword to move past the unseen force. As she fought to get free something had grabbed her neck and began to squeeze hard causing her to let go of the sword and fight for air.<br/><br/>“Poor thing, you tried so hard to avenge your brother, but alas, you are just as weak as he was. I might have let you live as you are the only one in this group of would be heroes whose past is not clouded with evil. However, blind hatred can fuel revenge and I cannot have you hounding me.” Celesa said as she squeezed harder.<br/><br/>The fight in the warrior began to end as her hands fell to her sides and struggling ceased. As she was about to deliver the final squeeze, Celesa is struck from behind by a ball of fire causing her to drop Denava.<br/><br/>“Who the heck wou…” She said as she turned to meet a purple fist to her face which sent her flying backwards.
