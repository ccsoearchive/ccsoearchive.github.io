Dusk Witherblade<br/><br/>It was not her real name. But it seemed to fit her well. The events leading up to her wielding a runic blade were heartbreaking. It was her story, her secret, her burden.<br/><br/>Dusk, the end of the day, the beginning of night. The sun setting over the sea left its warm pink glow on everything from trees to sand, the water reflecting the setting sun’s rays in glorious color. She sat on the beach, thankful tonight was quiet. No others littered the beach with their campfires and blankets. <br/><br/>Part of her denied what she was going through. Her hands were cold, but it did not seem to bother her at all. The glowing blade lay at her feet on the sand. The runes inscribed on it by her dead husbands hands. <br/><br/>Kale’Dukaren had died defending her and their extended family. The battle for Quel’Danas was brutal, so many had fallen. Her memories haunted her relentlessly.<br/><br/>Her use of blade and axe as a warrior was the only thing that had saved her mother and sister from the Scourge. Though they had been potent spellcasters and sister Graciel had kept her alive with the Light. While mother Daedralia had cast potent arcane energy at the ghouls and skeletons of the Scourge.<br/><br/>Dusk had watched in horror as a skeletal drake had picked up Kale in its talons and flew off. She screamed his name, but his answer was a scream that was suddenly cut off by his death. The Farstriders had fought to give them a chance to escape out of the besieged city. Daedralia had ushered both of her daughters to the safety of the mountains. <br/><br/>They hid in the forest and made camp with other refugees. Some time in the next few days, they learned that the city had been defended, but at a huge cost. So many dead, so many missing. Dusk moved in a semi numb state, nothing her mother or sister could say relieved her mind. Kale was gone, even his body stolen away. Yes he had been a hero, but that did not soothe the ache in her heart.<br/><br/>Weeks later in Silvermoon, they made a new home. Dusk continued her training as a warrior, renewing her efforts in a mindless way. It gave her focus and kept her from thinking. The troops needed to attempt to cleanse the Scar were begging for aid. Ghouls and skeletons were constantly cropping up. There seemed to be no end of them.<br/><br/>She fought them with a passion, slaughtering so many they piled at her feet in bones and gore. She became skilled at using two weapons, foregoing a shield for the extra damage she could do with axe and blade together.<br/><br/>(to be continued)

It was many months later that she got sent to Northrend. Taking the battle to Arthas was a combined effort of the Alliance and Horde. Dusk fought in the lowest level of Icecrown Citadel. She did not get to see Arthas killed, but the battle she fought would be etched in her mind forever.<br/><br/>He came at her from the edge of her vision, a dark clad warrior known as a Death Knight. His howl of rage and single minded destruction of the troops around her startled her out of her wits. She had seen death knights before. They were efficient killing machines, immune to the effects of some spells it seemed. Protected by Arthas’ magic, they were immortal and nearly unstoppable.<br/><br/>His helm covered his face, but the eerie blue glow of his eyes was unnerving. If she had seen the face of Arthas it would have chilled her blood in her veins. The voice was familiar, but was it him or someone who merely sounded like him?<br/><br/>She boldly challenged him in single combat, her fellow troopers cleared a place and kept the other ghouls from interfering. They cheered her on, encouraging her to end this death knight. Her heart in her throat as she readied herself for a charge.<br/><br/>But he was not an honorable warrior, he was a minion of Arthas, a brutal killer. Reaching out with a deathly grip he pulled her to him. Stunning her with his strength and feeding disease into her system. She recovered in time to block his sword from a killing blow. Using her axe to deflect it and slamming into his side with her sword as it caught the edge of the opening between chest piece and belt.<br/><br/>Ichor poured out of the wound and added to the diseases he carried. His howl was not of pain but anger as he traded her blow for blow. She staggered back time after time, trying to stay ahead of his persistent attacks. He was stronger than she and laughed with that echo that sent chills through her mind.<br/><br/>But she did not give up, her training did her well as she fought him. He could not best her, and it infuriated him. He called for aid and a ghoul rose from the ground to attack her. Shuddering with revulsion she rushed him, slamming into his body with the full force of her weight and armor. Using axe to stun him and blade to parry his sword. <br/><br/>She ignored the ghoul, even as it bit into her shoulder, grinding through the plate until she heard teeth break and the armor crack. It clawed at her face and she spun to throw him off, swinging axe and blade to chop at it as it fell from her. The claw marks on her face bled profusely, the blood dripping down the front of her armor. But to her surprise, the death knight sent a coil of unholy magic into it and healed its wounds.<br/><br/>(more)

Growling in pain, Dusk Impaled the ghoul on her sword and swung it in a wide arc, tossing it at the death knight. “Keep your pet!! I fight you, not him! Coward! Face me alone and do your worst! I am not afraid!”<br/><br/>The echo of his laughter was cruel and vicious, he caught the ghoul in his plated hands and crushed it’s spine. “I will use it as I see fit, after all it used to be one of your...friends.” his voice sparked something in her then. She hesitated, waiting to see if it was true. That hesitation almost cost her more than her heart.<br/><br/>It was Kale’s voice she heard! It could not be! He was a death knight ? Her shock and dismay gave him time to hurl even more icy pain into her system. It nearly froze the blood in her veins. Staggering beneath the onslaught of cold and mental anguish she faltered. He rained blows on her armor with two hands on his runed blade. <br/><br/>He caught her axe on his grip and tore it from her hands. Now she had only the sword to defend and try to attack him in return. She grunted in pain as he slammed into her with a plated fist into her gut. Doubling over in agony she rolled out of his range and fell down a steep stairway in the Citadel. The sword clattered behind her and landed near her head. The rest of her fellow warriors were too busy to come to her aid as they fought Vrykul and ghouls on the stairway and in the Halls.<br/><br/>She watched him come down the stairs, not in a hurry to deal the final blow. His echoed voice ringing in the halls. “You were always too emotional to fight properly, Deliah. I serve the Lich King now. And he is an uncompromising bastard. My soul is no longer my own, my heart is frozen, my life forever changed. I am immortal now. You cannot stop him...or me.” With that he removed the helm and she stared with tears in her eyes at the face of her love. Blurred as her vision was, she recognised him. His visage twisted in its rigor... and the eyes...the cold glowing eyes. There was no sign of the elf she had loved. Dropping the helm on the floor he grinned in anticipation.<br/><br/>He raised the two handed blade to strike her then as she lay at his feet. With a surge of panic she rolled as he swept down and the blade caught in the seam of the wall as he sought to change the course of his swing. Rolling to grab her sword she swung it as hard as she could at the juncture of neck and chest. The sound of the steel slicing through rotting flesh was sickening. The blow was enough to sever his head from his spine and it rolled to a stop against the wall as his body slumped before her.<br/><br/>They told her later her scream echoed through the halls for ten minutes. But all she remembered was picking up the runed blade. Her mind told her to let it go. It was not hers, but she could not relinquish it. Wrapping it in the dark cloak he wore she hid it from the rest. Many took treasures with them when they left. No one examined the bundle she carried.

When the cheering began she did not hear them. The medics treated her wounds, cleansed her of disease and sent her home. The worst was over, for almost all of those who were there, it was a relief. For some it was just the beginning of nightmares and regrets.<br/><br/>Dusk, the end of the day, the beginning of darkness. Fading light from the setting sun as it sank beneath the waves reflected in her long auburn hair. She did not light a fire as some would. The moon rose a few hours later and cast it’s silver light on her as she sat on the beach. Never in her life had she felt so alone.<br/><br/>This Fellowship she had joined seemed more filled with lunacy and naivety than cohesion. She did not know if she would stay. So far it was only a job. Nothing more, nothing less. The crackle of the guildstone occasionally irritated her and she shut it off. If there was one person who could get through to her and stop the spiral of madness she had not met them yet. Perhaps she never would.<br/><br/>Still sitting on the beach hours later as the sun returned to Eversong, Dusk turned her head as she watched her mother walking along the beach, collected shells and driftwood. Daedralia was not young as elves go. Her husband, the father of her children, was long gone. She was content to live her life as mother to her daughters and matron to orphans when she had the opportunity. Dusk picked up the glowing blade and wrapped it in the old cloak, securing it with the strip of leather. She set it in the bike sitting next to her.<br/><br/>“You did not return, I was worried. A mother’s prerogative, you know.” she smiled. She knew Dusk was not using her real name, but she also knew why. Settling down on the beach next to Dusk she reached to smooth her daughter’s hair.<br/><br/>“Mother, please! Do not paw at me...I am not a child!” but she could not duck far away enough to escape her mother’s hand as it landed on her shoulder.<br/><br/>Dae was startled as her hand touched the cool skin of her daughter’s arm. “Why are you so cold? And pale? You need to eat to stay strong..Deliah, please.” her voice begging.<br/><br/>“I am not hungry, I am fine. I still can beat the crap out of my trainers. They do not chide me like you do. Go home and mother Gracie. I am a warrior not a wimp.” she got up and climbed on her bike, the loud rumble of the motor roaring to life startled the seabirds.<br/><br/>“Where are you going? You have still not told me of this new job. Who is it that drives you so hard? I want to have a talk with them!” Her indignant voice lost in the swirl of sand as Dusk left her standing on the beach.<br/><br/>Making her way back to the house, Dusk passed none of the Sindorei she had met in the few days she had been in the Fellowship. It was a good thing, for they would not have liked the look in her eyes or the reckless way she flew through the streets.

Her room was clean and neat, as her mother always spent time there when Dusk was not home. It was for this reason Dusk carried the wrapped runeblade with her wherever she went. If it was not stored in the sidecar of the bike, it was in the stable with her wolf, hidden in the straw. <br/><br/>Packing everything she needed in a duffel bag, she got downstairs in time to see her mother come to the door. “I am going to go to the new settlement in the Plagued lands. It’s part of my new job. Don’t worry about me, all right?”<br/><br/>“Deliah please don’t leave. I don’t want to lose you now. You take too many chances.” Dae tried to stop her as she passed through the door.<br/><br/>“No...I have a job to do. I will visit when I can. Do not worry, all right? I will be fine. Take care of Gracie.” she held still for a moment. Reluctantly letting her mother hug her. It was hard to do this but necessary. She could not stand to watch her mother cry. Getting away to work out of town was the only way she could avoid it.<br/><br/>She also needed to avoid Gracie. The priest would notice the unholy aura around Dusk and try to fix it. But the warrior did not know if it was truly affecting her or not. The sword she did not want to give up. It was all she had left of Kale.<br/><br/>The plagued lands were regrowing slowly, some of the work of the druids, and of the Argent Crusaders. Dusk avoided the Argents, they would take her last remnant of Kale away. They would argue that a warrior had no business carrying a runed blade. And they were probably right, but she clung to it stubbornly. Her life was melancholy and she had no desire to return to the brightness and cheer of the Fellowship. <br/><br/>She moved in the shadows of doubt and the fear of being discovered. She grew hungry and need provisions. Going to Silvermoon would mean returning to her family. She went to Undercity to avoid the staring eyes of her mother and sister. Somehow it seemed more comfortable there for her. The thought never occurred to her she was becoming more undead than alive. If someone did not find a way to reverse this curse and get the blade from her...she would sink further into it.<br/><br/>A job, she needed a way to make a living. She was a good warrior, she could fight, she could lead, she could teach others the way of the sword. Maybe there was someone who needed a guard or something?

The Undercity was a morass of smell and slime. Most of the living who tread its halls wore masks or suffered the smell until they became used to it. Dusk was used to it, but did not like it. She picked up her supplies and went to the duty board. Tacked on a corner was a notice. A notation of a job opening requiring some discretion was listed. The person to post this left only a location to seek out someone at the Inn in Fairbreeze.<br/><br/>Curious, Dusk took the note and headed to the small village. The fine restaurant at the top of the building used to be a fancy bordello. Now it was simply a bed and breakfast for couples desiring privacy. The menu was fancy and the wine list was impressive. Dusk sat at a small table and ordered a simple glass of house wine.<br/><br/>Her quiet manner and curiousity was rewarded when the owner of the establishment came to inquire of her business. Dusk looked up as the tall willowy dark haired Sindorei approached.<br/><br/>"I am Lei Shadowstar, how is it a fine warrior like you is here alone?" her smile gracious. Lei's eyes traveled over the warrior with some apprehension. The hardness in the warrior's eyes was evident even when she smiled. It was not common to see a Sindorei with blue eyes, though as she got closer she noted the eyes were a blue green and not merely the flicker of undeath that marked a death knight.<br/><br/>Dusk looked over the dark haired elf with a measuring gaze. "I am here with this note I took off the duty board in the Undercity. It seems someone is in need of a discreet worker. I came seeking the job."<br/><br/>Lei was startled by the cold and calculating voice that came from the elf before her. It almost seemed the warrior was haunted by something, perhaps memories of a dark past. "I see. I need to verify that you will be discreet and worthy. The job entails a great responsibility as well as skill. You will be required to pass a skill test and to prove your loyalty. Are you prepared to give up all your previous commitments to this?" <br/><br/>The cold eyes of the warrior stared back at Lei. "My previous commitments are not worth mentioning, as they would not interfere with a job. As to skill, I am a trained warrior of the Horde. I have served all the way to Northrend and look forward to invading Pandaria soon. But I grow weary of Horde politics at the moment. I seek employment to fill in the time before I can go to the battles not yet requiring my aid."<br/><br/>The tall Sindorei nodded and turned to go. "If you want this job, you will have to be prepared to give all of that up. This is not a part time thing. It is a requirement you give up all past ties and serve the Master of the House. If you wish to have a job that will serve you the rest of your days, follow me. If not, then you are welcome to enjoy a meal and your wine and go back to Undercity."<br/><br/>Dusk was surprised to say the least. Who was this Master and what did he want of a total commitment? Her eyes followed Lei as she went into her office at the far end of the room.

(My Point of view) I was walking through the streets of the undercity, planning an attack on Slylvanas for killing a dear friend of mine. Prince Liam Greymane.<br/><br/> I accidentaly walked into the wrong house and saw it empty of nothing but a bartender from the looks of it, and somebody walking up a Bloodelf walking into a room.<br/><br/> The bartender saw me and his eyes widened, but before he could say a word I sent a Lightning bolt which made him choke to near death. As this was happening I summoned a minion and walked over to him pulling out two one-handed swords. <br/><br/>"I am looking for the banshee queen." I said as he was released from the telakenetik grip and fell to the floor, for the grip to be replaced by chains of Ice.'<br/><br/>"I'm afraid I cannot help you." He said gasping. How pathetic. "But that lady in there might." He said while pointing towards the room the lady went in. <br/><br/> "Thank you." I said as I smiled evilly. I cut off his head. "You've been a wonderful assistance to me." I said as I walked into the room.

There was not much choice, she had to have a job to help her sister who was still in training, and a mother who was old and widowed. Sipping the wine slowly she considered her options. Join the Horde war machine or live closer to family and maybe, just maybe find a way to stop the curse from turning her undead.<br/><br/>Swallowing her pride she got up from her seat and went to the door of the office. Knocking twice she cleared her throat. "I am interested, but I want more information on this job. I also have a special need that should be addressed." she was quiet, not wanting to disturb the other diners.<br/><br/>Lei nodded to her personal guard who opened the door and let her in. He was a tall and very imposing Tauren death knight. He sniffed at her in surprise as she walked in the door. "You smell of death, you shall not harm the Mistress...or suffer endless torment." he fingered his axe that was glowing over his shoulder.<br/><br/>"You smell of cow and undeath, I am not afraid of you, Tauren." Dusk was cold and calculating. She knew to show fear was to lose immediately. Staring at the icecold eyes of the tauren she stood her ground until Lei chuckled softly.<br/><br/>"All right, so you are brave enough to face a tauren death knight. I would have you prove yourself against him. He might like to smash you to bits just for fun. But I think that Lord Bloodmoon would prefer to test you himself." she sat at her desk in a comfortable chair.<br/><br/>Dusk did not lose eye contact with the Tauren until Lei spoke and he turned away. He chuckled softly and nodded to her. "I would enjoy a chance to show you how a real death knight fights. But I defer to Lei, she is the Boss." he went back to standing guard at the other door. <br/><br/>Dusk noticed immediately that security was pretty tight for a restaurant. "So I am wondering if you have more than this restaurant you run here. Security is pretty obvious and not usual for an eatery?"<br/><br/>Lei steepled her hands in front of her face and nodded. "I do indeed have other interests. A recent conflict with a House of demon worshipers has made me add a bit of security, yes. But I am also looking for discreet guards for a contact who pays well. Now, what is this special need you have and how would it effect your job?" Her jade eyes studied the warrior with interest.<br/><br/>(to be continues)

The jade eyes of the Sindorei who sat at the desk were very perceptive. Dusk knew she could not fool this one with falsehoods. Standing in front of the desk she looked at the chair and then at Lei. "I am Dusk Witherblade. Yes it is a false name, but I prefer it. The Horde war machine accepts it and it is what I am known by in Silvermoon. I am a warrior with a past that stretches to Northrend. I have fought those like him..." she glanced at the Tauren and paused.<br/><br/>"I was married and my husband became one of Arthas' death knights. He was not freed with so many of the others at Light's Hope. He was raised I believe much later. When I went to search for him...we fought." her eyes revealed only the deep sadness she now felt.<br/><br/>"He tried to kill me...I had no choice but to defend myself and to...put him down." she had to pause to regain her composure. "I took his sword...I felt compelled to keep it."<br/><br/>Lei watched the elf as she told her story. Her eyes went to the blades that Dusk had at her side. "Those are not runed death knight blades." her voice curious.<br/><br/>"No, they are simply good blades. I am studying with a master smith, he tells me there are ways to reforge the death knight blades. But it is very dangerous. He suggested I get rid of the blade I took from my husband. But I cannot bring myself to part with it. I have been warned it is cursed, possibly containing his spirit. It is all I have left of him...I want to keep it." her voice sounding almost desperate.<br/><br/>The Tauren shook his head sadly, "It will turn you undead, it has already started. But it will not be pretty. You will become like a mindless Scourge. Dangerous, and you will have to face true death then. I wondered what that bulge was across your back and under your cloak. Let me take it for you. Perhaps if you are away from it..." he was rudely interrupted as Dusk swung around and glared at him.<br/><br/>"No! I will keep it! I will find a way to wield it! I swear! There has to be a way!" her voice raising in a defiance the Tauren actually admired.<br/><br/>(to be continued)

The rogue was startled by the vehemence in Dusk's tone. "It's all right...we won't take it from you...calm down...it appears you have a very strong emotional attachment to the sword. OR is it more than that? Greathoof, can you tell if that sword is more than it appears?" her question directed at the Tauren.<br/><br/>The death knight stood behind the elf and cocked his head in contemplation. Reaching out a hand not to touch but merely to seek an aura, he finally nodded. "I houses a spirit, malevolent and angry. But I cannot speak to it. Perhaps a shaman or a priest? At the very least a warlock might be able to contact it. I strongly suggest you seek an answer to your problem, and do not wait long."<br/><br/>"It is not a problem, it's a sword...it belonged to Kale...if it is a spirit...it is his. I will not give it up." Dusk declared again. Though she was unsure of the fact of the malevolent nature of it.<br/><br/>"Allow me to help you with this, I have a friend, a warlock. She can tell you more about that blade. She is also an expert on curses." Lei offered. "If she can give you some peace with the blade, perhaps you can still have a chance at stopping it from harming you. It is clear to me and to Greathoof, it is affecting you. Stay this night, I want to help you. I will send for Lillideth. You can meet her tomorrow and she will advise you." her voice as calming and soothing as possible.<br/><br/>Dusk tried to relax. She had been to many healers and they had all tried to help, but they declared her near crazy to be wanting to keep the blade. Perhaps a warlock could offer some kind of solution. "All right, at this point I am willing to try anything. What about the job?" her voice hopeful.<br/><br/>Lei pondered a moment before answering. "It will be up to Lord Bloodmoon to hire you, if you do well in tests he will no doubt accept you. But you must tell him the truth about the blade and do not try to hide it. He is not one who likes to be fooled." she shrugged and then continued. "Perhaps he may offer to help. He likes people to be loyal. If he sees a potential in you, and you are willing to swear to him...he will treat you well, I am sure."

The sitting room in the restaurant was empty except for Lei and Dusk. They sat at a large table, Lei sipping her customary brandy after dinner. Dusk drank wine, but not a strong one. She was nervous and jumpy. When the sentry at the door announced, "Miss Lillideth Blacktalon." Dusk nearly lost her composure.<br/><br/>Lei turned to Lilli and smiled. "Welcome, I am glad you could come at such short notice. This is Dusk Wytherblade. She has a story to tell, come and relax we will not be disturbed." and at her signal the sentry closed the door to the room and stood guard in front of it.<br/><br/>The tall redheaded warlock sauntered into the room, giving the warrior a long and steady gaze. "I can feel it, the warped aura of curses and fel magic. Tell me your story, child. Perhaps I can help." she sat in the vacant chair and nodded as Lei poured her a glass of brandy.<br/><br/>Dusk cleared her throat and began, "I and my family were there in Quel'Danas when the Scourge came through. My husband Kale was defending us alongside me. Mother and sister were in back of us firing off heals and arcane magic. He was taken from me...I heard him scream...and it cut off..." she had to stop and wipe her eyes.<br/><br/>"We escaped by the grace of the Light. We hid in the hills. There were so many refugees. Banding together to form defenses. It took days before we were allowed back into the city."<br/><br/> Dusk calmed a bit and told of her training. How she had worked hard to become one of the best. How she had been recruited for Northrend and went gladly to fight Arthas. But she never made it that far. When she had to tell of her fight with Kale as a death knight, she gripped the glass tightly, until Lei was afraid it would shatter.<br/><br/>"I never dreamed it would come to that. I love him dearly, I cannot bear to part with all I have left of him...please, help me find a way to keep it." her last words whispered in desperation.<br/><br/>Lilli sat back in her chair, the brandy glass nearly empty as she studied Dusk. "You are very lucky. You could have joined him in there. A prison for a soul. I often wondered what happened to all those that Arthas stole?" she was calm as she spoke. <br/><br/>The sword lay across Dusk's lap. Lilli could sense the aura from it. Cold as death but wickedly aware of all around it. "Even now I can see tendrils of shadow reaching out to tangle in your soul. I can do something to block it for now. But it will still have an influence on you. It will fight me. But I am strong willed. I fear we must restrain you for this. For the safety of us all. Are you willing for me to do this?" her fel green eyes studied Dusk intently.<br/><br/>Dusk looked at the blade sitting in her lap. Was this the only way? Her eyes went to Lilli and she nodded, then whispered. "Yes...do it...whatever it takes. I am willing."

Whatever Dusk expected, it was not something she could have guessed. Lei took her to a room in the back and asked her to lay on a table. Dusk was unsure of what they would do. Lilli handed her a vial. "Drink this, it will help you relax. This will not be pleasant. I am sorry, but its the only way I can deal with it now. It will take a complex ritual to settle this permanently. When you are ready I have someone in mind to help you. I will send her to Lord Bloodmoon. She will know what to do. In the mean time, I can do some interference. But it will wear off in time."<br/><br/>Dusk drank the vial and was actually surprised it did not taste bad. As soon as she swallowed the last of it her head started spinning. She lay back on the table and the room dimmed. In her mind the world spun crazily like she was drunk.<br/><br/>Lilli lit candles with her finger and placed them at the foot of the table and at the head of it. Lei stood back until Lilli nodded, then she moved forward and snapped shackles on Dusk's feet and wrists. By this time Dusk was too out of it to notice.<br/><br/>Lilli called forth her Felguard who drew the blade off of Dusk's back and laid it across her stomach. In a chant that was both horrifying and discordant in tone, Lilli and the demon walked around the table seven times. Lilli stopping at the head and the Felguard at her feet.<br/><br/>Reaching out with her shadow magic, Lilli started severing the tendrils of shadow that were imbedded in Dusk's soul. It made the poor girl shudder in agony, but her quiet whimpers were only heard by those in the room. In her mind she was screaming in the halls of her nightmares.<br/><br/>Her soul was shredded and dim when Lilli had to stop. "Any more and she will die. I cannot do more without a healer present. I have weakened the links to her blade, but that spirit is strong, very malevolent and evil. It will reassert itself in time. At least this way she can set the blade down for short periods of time and maybe wean herself from it. But there are no guarantees. In two days time she will be back to her almost normal self. See to it she is well fed and rested."<br/><br/>Lilli and the demon left the room and Dusk lay unconcious on the table. Lei nodded and waited a few moments before having the Tauren come in and lift her from the table and take her to a bed. He wanted to take the blade then, but Lei would not let him. "She is still tied to it. Taking it now will kill her for sure. We will leave it in the room with her and when she comes out of it she will be a little better. I just hope Gidean can help her."

It took Dusk three days to recover. She was weak and disoriented the first day. Lei fed her and kept her in the room until the third day. When Dusk left to meet with Gidean she had recovered enough to meet his test.<br/><br/>The Bloodmoon estate was looking a little worse for the recent events. A blackened burned out shell was in the back half of the property. The grounds were well kept however and she was impressed with the servants and the quiet charm of the old butler Belmont.<br/><br/>She was nervous when she met Gidean Bloodmoon. He was a powerful mage and had many high ranking friends in the noble Houses. She met him with a confident air however. She wanted to impress him with her skill.<br/><br/>He had talked to her about loyalty and how much he valued it in his employees. She was impressed by his charm and good looks. He had a young apprentice by his side who was almost like a mouse. Quiet and observant, and very pretty. She stayed inside while he took Dusk out to meet the rest of the guards.<br/><br/>The test was simple as she sparred with the half trained guards who came at her in a cheerful effort to impress their employer. She did not lose to any of them. In spite of her recent bout with the warlock Lilli. Her physical prowess was unequaled.<br/><br/>Gidean hired her and she moved in that week. Her room was spacious and comfortable. Dusk was not the sort to worry about closet space or comfort, but she did not complain. It took a few days for her to adjust to the schedule of the guards. She worked with them and made a few changes to the working schedule. They all seemed happy with her and all was well.<br/><br/>Until the day that Linnaea was kidnapped. All heck broke loose and Gidean was beside himself with worry. Apparantly he had a serious enemy who objected to a guest that Gidean had in his Manor. He had demanded a trade. Linnaea for this fluff named Aophie that seemed to be happy to be with Gidean. <br/><br/>Dusk had no idea what was happening but she followed orders to the letter. She escorted them to Booty Bay where the exchange took place. Gidean was forced to swear a blood oath to get Linnaea back. Dusk watched with little understanding other than that her new employer had some serious enemies.<br/><br/>It was not until they were all safe back home that Dusk started feeling the tightening of the cursed blade on her soul. Gidean noticed it too. And when she told her story he was convinced that the spirit inside the blade was not her Kale.

The night was interesting but also disturbing. Gidean and Linnaea were both convinced the spirit in the blade was not Kale. They both told her of different circumstances of a bond that was hard to break. She was not a drug addict, but her attachment to the blade seemed like it. Was it influencing her mind? Could it be forcing her apathy by dulling her natural defences?<br/><br/> It was hard for Dusk to accept. She kept denying it. How could Kale be so malevolent and evil? Was he angry at her for stealing his life when he was bonded to the Lich King? Or was it true that it was another spirit, and it was somehow killing her, slowly but surely turning her undead?<br/><br/>Dusk shuddered and sat staring at the blade as it rested in the weapon rack in her room. If it was true, then it was good she was not at home any longer. She did not want to harm her mother or sister. If it was turning her undead like the Tauren warned, she would become a danger to all near her.<br/><br/>Confused and uncertain, she asked Gidean to arrange what he could to free her of the blade. She had a bad feeling this was not going to be a pleasant thing. If what Lilli said was true, it would take a warlock and a priest to force the evil spirit from her soul. It would leave the blade empty. It would erase all she had left of Kale. Could she go through with it?

A day off was what she really did not need, but the guard Captain was entitled and Dusk decided to take advantage of it. Strolling Murder Row in Silvermoon, she eyed the various shady characters along the street. They gave her no trouble as she wandered up and down, trying to decide if the warlocks would have any ideas. Lei had mentioned a warlock named Lillideth, but she was not in the warlocks sanctum.<br/><br/>"There has to be someone somewhere who has a clue. Someone who deals in souls and dark magic. But could I trust them?" her quiet murmers were actually over heard. A sibilant whisper came from the shadows. <br/><br/>"What is it you seek?" the figure she noticed hovering in the shadows beckoned her to him. Dusk hesitated, this was not a safe place to speak to total strangers. "I sense something off about your sword. Come closer warrior, allow me to see...I will not touch it."<br/><br/>The darkness of his hood hid most of his face, and what he did reveal was a glint of metal on his sensuous lips. She stepped closer, drawing the blade cautiously and holding it loosely in her hand in front of her. "Yes, it is cursed, possibly with a spirit trapped inside. It is my husbands blade. He was a death knight." she stood still as he approached her, though he did not move far from the shadow of the building. <br/><br/>His long dark cloak hid all of his figure, the bulk of his back was strangely shaped. She figured it was a sword or other weapon sheathed beneath the cloth. He did have a sword at his side and she was sure a dagger as well. When he reached out a hand to hover over her blade it was a talon that made her heart skip a beat. His voice sounded normal though deep for an elf. "Your blade contains a spirit, it is true. Though you say you know who it is?"<br/><br/>She nodded, "I fought him, he was trying to kill me. My husband..." her voice broke. No matter how many times she told her tale, it hurt to remember this was the elf she loved. It was all she had left of him. Denial screamed in her mind whenever anyone tried to tell her different. "He was taken at Quel'Danas...the rest of us escaped...I went later to Icecrown...ended up killing him. I am sure it is his spirit in the blade."<br/><br/>Dusk was uncertain if she should tell him more. But she did, eventually, and he offered some help in a manner she had not expected. "I just want...to be able to keep the blade. I am a warrior, I want to use it. I have been told...it is turning me undead. Is it possible to stop it or keep it from happening and still allow me to keep the blade?" her words desperate.<br/><br/>"Come to me Monday, and I will find the answers you seek. We will work together. I will help you find a way. I am thinking a rune, on your body somewhere, will keep your soul safer. Until you can release that trapped spirit and cleanse your soul of its taint." His words offered her hope and she agreed.

The day off was welcomed this time. She had an appointment. Whether the application of a rune would help her she did not know for sure. But she was willing to try it. <br/><br/>The Jeweler's shop was not busy as she walked in the door and nodded to the clerk. She could see the elf she knew as Wraith sitting at a table, a woman stood beside him hooded and alert. For not the first time Dusk wondered at the use of hoods. What were they hiding. Perhaps she should not ask.<br/><br/>"I am here for my appointment." she was calm and sure of herself. She noted the woman seemed to be very close to Wrath. She guessed a lover even before the kiss on the cheek she bestowed on Wraith. She busied herself getting supplies as Dusk chatted with him.<br/><br/>"Have you given any thought to what rune to use?" her cool blue green eyes studied him. He seemed to have a mysterious air about him. She was not sure what he was. <br/><br/>"Its a rune of protection, I will put it on the nape of your neck. What color do you prefer?" he chatted as he prepared the inks and a strange looking machine that resembled a rose. He waved her to a chair and she turned her back to him, straddling the chair and leaning on the back of it. She nodded as he mentioned the nape of her neck. The base of the soul, she had heard it called at one time. Removing her cloak and setting it on the table she also put the sword there. It glowed with malevolence. <br/><br/>"I prefer blue or black, maybe a dark blue? Color does not matter?" she had no idea of how runes worked. She would never see it anyway. She hoped it would not look too bad. <br/><br/>The other woman helped him by selecting a shimmering dark blue ink. Wraith assembled his machine and took great care in making sure it was clean and ready. "That will do fine, love."<br/><br/>Dusk took her hood and stuffed the rest of her hair into it to give him a clear field to work. The rest of her back was bare as the plate armor she wore only covered her chest and shoulders. Faint scars criss crossed her long torso. Her toned muscles befitting a warrior. Dusk was not in the least modest. She had worked in the battlefields with soldiers and had no desire to hide her body. None bothered her without risk to their intimate parts.<br/><br/>"Color is all up to you, the rune works by its shape and the power inherent in the rune itself. It will be active once I finish it." he was calm and sure.<br/><br/>Dusk nodded. "Blue it is then. What shall I expect from this? I mean, will it hurt?" she would not stop if it hurt like hell. she wanted it over with.<br/><br/>"it is pain and the sound of bees buzzing." the woman offered nonchallantly. <br/><br/>(to be continued)

The smirk on Dusk's face was not seen by them as she had her head buried in the crook of her arms. "I am used to pain, I am a warrior. I am ready when you are."<br/><br/>Wraith cleaned her neck with water and a cloth, then applied a thin coat of ointment to her neck, blotting it gently. "It will feel like a razor cut or something like it. not too bad. Are you ready?" <br/><br/>Dusk did not see the gleam in his dark eyes or the smile on his face. She could tell little from his voice other than that he was going to start. "Yes, go ahead, I am ready." she took a long deep breath and let it out slowly. She sat perfectly still, not wanting him to smudge or disturb the perfection of his art.<br/><br/>The feeling was like nothing she had ever felt before. In the heat of battle the rush of adreneline dulled the nerves, you did not feel the sharpness of a dagger cut until after it had sliced you open. Sometimes not until the battle was over. The smooth drawing of the line down her neck on either side of her spine tingled as he worked, the dull throb of pain chased the needles as they moved. Faster than she thought he had made two lines from hairline to the base of her neck, about three inches long. Then he blotted the blood and excess ink. <br/><br/>"Doing all right?" he asked. His voice calm and professional. <br/><br/>"Yes, I am fine, its not as bad as I thought it would be." she was still holding very still and had to remember to keep breathing slowly. The slow spiraling up of heat and natural reactions to the invasion into her skin seemed almost too slow. She could feel it, but it was a dull ache rather than a sharp pain. She wondered if the sword/spirit had some influence on her after all?<br/><br/>He continued then to draw a branch on each side of the first two lines. Making a symbol much like a crow's foot. He left the bottom open. Cleaning out the needles he changed to a different set. "I will fill it in with a lighter blue. This will look nice when I am done. The final line will activate the rune." he placed a clean cloth over the art and asked her to hold it there, to soak up the slight bleeding and the excess ink.<br/><br/>Dusk could feel the heat from the spot on her neck. It seeped through the thin cloth as she held her hand over it. Strangely it did nothing more than throb a bit, a dull ache, like a sore tooth.<br/><br/>Wraith cleaned the machine and changed needles to a set more like a caligraphy pen as he filled the ink reservoir with a lighter toned blue. When he went back to her neck, she could feel the movement of the needles as he filled in the space between the lines. He added some kind of pattern inside of the symbol, working to make it pretty. <br/><br/>Dusk took slow and even breaths, trying to stay steady. She was getting used to his movements and did not flinch. He was almost done then and sat back. "One last line to close it and it will activate." he cleaned the lighter blue ink out and dipped the needles into the dark blue once again. <br/><br/>(to be continued)

Dusk was not sure what the reaction would be from the spirit/sword. Her eyes were closed as she cleared her throat and mumbled. "All right...do it." she took a slow long breath in and held it briefly as he did the final line to close the rune. <br/><br/>There was a flash of blue white light and a dull throb on her neck. The feeling of something settling in place was very certain. The reaction was not something she could even have imagined. A keening came from the sword/spirit, with a roar behind it that echoed in her mind. She could not help but feel the urge to scream. Straining to hold it back as the echo of agony and despair tried to force its way past her gritted teeth. A sound came from her throat, much like the muted growl of a cat about to squall in a fierce scream.<br/><br/>She gripped the back of the chair with white knuckled hands. Her voice was strained and groaned as if she could not stop herself from speaking. "Nooooo! You will not...have ...me." it was forced out between gritted teeth.<br/><br/>Wraith and his helper stood in tense alertness as they watched her. He could see the tendrils of shadow reaching for her and coiling away as they neared the rune. His voice was calm, "It's working, the spirit cannot do you anymore harm right now, but sooner or later, it will try to get past it. There is a chance it will break the rune. But it should give you time to get someone to remove the bond. Soon would be good."<br/><br/>The sound of her breath came as a relief, her head spinning as she fought for control. Finally it subsided. Withdrawing and leaving her trembling. What pain there was on her neck was overshadowed by her whirling thoughts. It took her a few minutes more to speak, albeit a slightly shakey voice. "It will be taken care of soon. I thank you for this...what do I owe you? Gold or service? I have some free time, but not a lot"<br/><br/>He looked to his assistant and her glare decided for him. "Gold is good. I believe it will do nicely." he started cleaning up as Dusk recovered enough to breath normally. Blotting the rune with a clean cloth and then spreading the ointment on it carefully. He wrapped a few strips of windwool around her neck and fastened it lightly. "Keep it covered for a day and then give it air. It should heal nicely. Oh, do not rub on it or scratch the lines or you will make the rune ineffective." he finished and went to work cleaning his machine.<br/><br/>The feeling pf the bandage around her neck was strange. It was not tight, just enough to cover the art and keep it clean. Dusk fastened the cloak loosely over her shoulders. Digging into her satchel she pulled out a sack of gold coins and handed it to him. "I will let you know how it goes this weekend. I owe you that much."<br/><br/>The face of the elf was still shrouded in his hood, but his words caught her by surprise. "The spirit in your sword, is not your husband. It is some name I cannot make out, but not Kale."<br/><br/>Dusk was glad to be leaving the shop, she had a lot to think about.

The cozy quiet of her room in the Bloodmoon manor gave her time to think. Dusk knew they had something planned for her, but she had no idea what they would do. She was not a huge magic user. The little bit of frost magic taught to her by her mage mother was very weak. She wondered if she could augment it with magic runes on her body. Or even if the possibility existed of her making more runes on her body. Would it interfere with the protection rune on her neck?<br/><br/>It itched and she had to refrain from touching it. The warning to not scratch was of course a demonic urge to do so. Or was there something else at work? She glanced at the sword standing in its rack. She was able to put it down and sit apart from it and even sleep. But it did have a pull to it, even as she stared, she had the urge to pick it up, to swing it at something.<br/><br/>Frowning slightly she got ready for bed. Tomorrow she would take the bandage off and expose the new tattoo to the air. She had picked up a jar of anti itch cream from an alchemist in Silvermoon. Unwrapping the windwool, she took a bit of the cream on her fingertips and gently rubbed it into the scabbed over rune. It seemed rough to her touch, but she had to way of looking at it. Still a bit warm to the touch, but not unduly so. <br/><br/>If it continued to itch she might have to get something else for it. But the cream helped and she wrapped a fresh bandage around it. Tomorrow she would show it to Gidean and Linnaea. She wondered what their reaction would be? She might have to find a hand mirror to be able to see it for herself. <br/><br/>Laying down on the bed she covered herself and drifted off to sleep. But no sooner had she settled into a pleasant dream when it became apparent that something was not right. Twisted tendrils of thoughts raced through her dream. It was as if something else was trying to speak into her mind, but could not find purchase. If the rune was working as intended, it was having a very hard time doing so. <br/><br/>In her dream she raced through a hallway, armed with the sword, but naked of any armor. Whispers came at her from all angles. "Run! Run little one...your time will come..you will plead for my aid. You will seek my essense...I will not be far...run!!!"<br/><br/>She ran on and on, hallways twisting into a maze of confusion and odd colors. Red, purple, and black shadowy tendrils reached out to her. Touching her body, sending thrills and chills racing down her spine. "NO!! You will not have me! I am not your toy! I am Dusk...I am not a death knight! I am a warrior!"<br/><br/>Suddenly she fell in her dream, slipping and sliding into a black fathom of a hole. She awoke screaming...<br/><br/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOkJaJjfzbE

The nightwatch guards came running when she screamed. Pounding on her locked door, Jahar called out, "Captain? Are you all right? Captain?"<br/><br/>Dusk sat up in the bed, trembling and confused, it had been a very real nightmare. Reaching for the covers she stood to go to the door. Her flimsy nightgown would probably excite the guard, but she did not care. Unlocking the door, she peered out at him, her disheveled head and sleep deprived eyes startling. "I am fine, was just a dream. Good job on getting here fast, Jahar. Back to your station."<br/><br/>The guard was relieved she was all right, but hesitated, his eyes roving over her barely covered form. When his gaze returned to her face he scrambled back to his station, saluting her with respect. "Yes, Captain!" The look in her eyes was beyond frightening, he was sure she would have skinned him alive for just looking.<br/><br/>It was nearing dawn and it was clear to Dusk she would not be going back to sleep soon. Yawning with her hand over her face, she closed the door again and grabbed towel and fresh armor. Not even bothering to cover her skimpy attire she made her way out to the outdoor pool in the courtyard. By the light of a few security torches and the now rosy pink of dawn she stripped and dove into the pool. She did not care if the men patrolling the grounds saw her. <br/><br/>Jahar was back at his station at the door of the manor. "You should have seen the look in her eyes! I swear she wanted to remove my jewels with a rusty spoon! Stay away from her, and do not look at that magnificent body. She is not one to trifle with!" he was oddly excited by this, wondering if there was anyone who dared to approach her.<br/><br/>Stepping out of the pool as the early morning sun caught the water dripping off her form, Dusk was not aware if the Master of the House knew of her nightmares. She wrapped the towel over her hair after she finished drying. As she donned her armor, it occurred to her that the rune was working as it should, but it was not stopping all of the effects of the spirit/sword. <br/><br/>She was too exhausted to eat anything, but wandered into the kitchen, her hair still damp. Tossing the towel into the laundry hamper she smiled at the cook. "Just some kava, thanks." as she sat down in the cozy kitchen.<br/><br/>The cook looked a bit worried. "Dusk, you should get something for that sleep problem. But I wanted to ask you a question...the Lord's pretty apprentice, she is afraid. I sent her into the garden for herbs and she nearly wrecked it. Something frightened her, badly. I looked out and saw nothing but a fat old rabbit. Perhaps you need to see if someone or something has breached the fence?"<br/><br/>(cont)
