The peace of Thunderbluff was beginning to wear on him. He needed this job. For the first time in many years he had a job that was steady. He was working on the arrangements with his friends. Practice and more practice, they needed even more to perfect their act.<br/><br/>He left Mina and walked back to the tent where Vivi waited for him. He was flattered by her attention, but something told him she would not toy with him for long. She was flighty and hot, she liked it passionate and all night. Her appetite was voracious, but if she wanted him to bow to her she was mistaken. He tolerated her dominion over him, for the sake of the job. <br/><br/>He was not ready for Vivi's lesson that night. She drew him into the tent and sealed the flap with a spell. "I am told you refused to make use of the demonic training you were offered. Is that true?" her voice though soft, was demanding of his attention.<br/><br/>Riavis gazed at her in confusion. "I can call them, if I need them. I do not do it often. They are clingy and demanding. Always begging to sip someone's soul, to devour their very essence. I do not do that...I use the fel fire. It is effective and not so...damning." he chuckled as he got undressed and lay in the furs watching her.<br/><br/>Vivieka was not amused. "I see. The trainers in Silvermoon tell me you have unusual talent in the fire magic. That is good. It is also good you do not give into the temptations of the demons. But you must feed them. In order for your power to grow, they must grow as well. They have much to teach you yet. As do I..." her sultry voice echoed in his mind.<br/><br/>He tensed as she slowly walked towards him. "You are going to teach me what, Vivi? How to devour souls for the pleasure of the demons under my control? I was not aware I had signed onto the Cirque for warlock training." he felt a curious sensation as she straddled him. Like a cold hand traced down his spine, but instead of ice it left a searing pain that made him gasp.<br/><br/>"You did not, but I want to show you something...to make you more useful to me and the Cirque. I find your naivety and stubbornness charming. But it is not useful to me to have a half trained warlock hiding his true calling. Of course it is important to not alarm the Tauren. It is why I have sealed us in here. Now it begins." her hand reached out to wave a demonic rune in the air. The tent became a void in the circle of tents on the bluff. No sound from the outside entered. And no sound from the inside was heard. The interior of the tent faded to the flat red landscape of the desert like Nether. <br/><br/>Riavis nearly jumped out of his skin. He could not sit up, as Vivi held him down with her body. "What is this? What happened to the tent...the bluff...everyone else?" his nerves were tingling with the pain she had just shot into him. His eyes blazed with Fel and he grabbed her arms. Trying desperately to push her from him, but she held him like a scalding rock across his torso.<br/><br/>Viv grinned at his struggle, "They are where they have been. We are somewhere else. Lesson one...do not resist me. I will not kill you...just teach you some control...it is what you lack." she leaned down to kiss him passionately

Jak flew with the wind, soaring ever higher over the central mesas of Thunder Bluff. Then sweeping down through the other rises, feeling the power of the wind and warmth of the sun on his feathers. He felt like he had been made to fly. <br/><br/>He would hang in the sky, gliding on the thermals, seeking the form of the elusive Ginik. He began to consciously search for her, first the Spirit Rise and the holy ones. Then gliding over the Elder Rise being patient in his search. And finally he soared close to the Hunter Rise thinking he might find her there, amongst a group of braves. <br/><br/>He couldn't blame them, she had a quiet and peaceful sense of beauty he had never seen or felt with the other maidens of the mesa or rises. He widened his flight to slowly include the other cliffsides and mountains nearby. She was someone worthy of fighting for, and a prize to be sought. And yet, somehow he knew she did not think of herself that way. Which in his eyes made Gini even more desireable.<br/><br/>He slowed his flight, hanging in the thermals, cirlcling in a small holding pattern above the Hunter's Rise. Trying to catch a brief glimpse of Gini before retiring for the day.<br/><br/>He couldn't help noticing the others that had begun to spin and circle out amongst the winds and drafts of air that moved about the mesa and rises. He realized that he was not alone in his love of the air.

The day dawned crisp and cold, as every day in Dalaran. Hahnai snuggled closer into the warm blankets. She missed Azmos, his warmth and even the fur on his body. Her mouth quirked in a smile as she lay there dreaming of him and how he had developed into the passionate caring lover she always thought she wanted. But where was he now? Back in Pandaria, probably warm and toasty in the tropical paradise. While she shivered in the bed alone in a Dalaran Inn.<br/><br/>Sighing with frustration she threw the covers off and slid her feet into the fuzzy slippers she had bought her first day here. The warm wool robe wrapped around her as she went to the small brazier to set the teakettle to boil. Her breakfast would wait until she could get dressed and head to the dining room. Sitting by the window she sipped the hot tea and wondered if she would find anyone to travel with her today. <br/><br/>None of the other members of Cirque seemed interested in going to Northrend. She blamed herself for not spending more time with them. She really needed to be more social. The warm clothing was not nearly enough, but it was all she had to keep the chill away. Getting dressed she headed to the lounge to see if any adventurers were heading out.<br/><br/>The Blood elf paladin sitting near the door seemed to be studying a map. Perhaps...she approached him just as a very shapely female elf settled down at the table and kissed his ear. So much for that, Hahnai thought, females that possessive would not welcome another female.<br/><br/> Hahnai sighed and sat at another table. She ordered a hearty breakfast. Azmos would be proud as she consumed eggs and bacon and potatoes with an appetite she came to learn was needed in the cold environment.<br/><br/>Dave Harlan came down the stairs and grinned. He went right to the table where Hahnai sat alone. "Good morning Sunshine. I see you are having a good breakfast. When are we leaving?" he assumed and sat beside her, ordering a meal for himself.<br/><br/>Hahnai looked up at him and blinked, "We? I did not know you intended on traveling out into the wilderness. I am seeking herbs, not much fun...maybe you had better find other companions." she offered dryly.<br/><br/>Dave dug into his breakfast and chuckled. "You underestimate the word fun. I do not intend on letting you wander the wilds on your own. It is much too dangerous. I do not mind letting you pick herbs, I know where there is a lot of Tamara's Rose, some Icethorn and maybe some others I don't know the names of." he smiled as he sipped some tea. His eyes sparkled in amusement.<br/><br/>Something about him made her hesitate. She was not sure what it was. But her only options were waiting for more of her Sindorei friends to show up or join another party. "I am not quite ready...perhaps you can go ahead without me. I do not want to hold you back." she smiled at him, not wanting to make trouble.

<em> Dalaran</em><br/><br/>In a dark corner of the Lounge in Dalaran, two men watched as a human spoke to a sin'dorei, rather cheerfully, both men found the pairing... odd. One of the men covered in a too big cloak, whispered, "I don't like the look of that one," his voice was hollow, and echoed, marking him as a death knight, which was why he wore the cloak, he found it easier to blend in that way. The other man, a blood elf, with white hair, and the armor of a paladin nodded, "I do not believe the human's intentions to be pure, I sense nothing, but evil in the way he looks at the woman."<br/><br/>The death knight, Dalfein Scourgebane, laughed, "You see evil everywhere, they could simply be playing a game, from what you have told me you know a little something about women playing games with you as of late."<br/><br/>The paladin Illisdel Lightsun growled, "Shut up, sometimes it pays to be paranoid."<br/><br/>The death knight frowned, "Are you sure you should even be here, don't you need to practice with those new friends of yours?"<br/><br/>Illis frowned down at his food, "They are probably too busy playing their games with Rivi to even notice my abscence, besides this is something I must do to pay my respects to my men."<br/><br/>Dalfein sighed, "Coming to Northrend every year on the day your squad was annihilated, to do some righteous deed," he looked back to the human, and blood elf, "perhaps there is your good deed, we could take care of the guy bothering her, or even take her out to pick her herbs." The two had overheard their conversation the previous night, so they knew why the sin'dorei was in Northrend.<br/><br/>Illis shook his head, "Even though the man gives me a bad feeling, we have no proof he means the woman harm," he tilted his head in thought for a moment, "Still I suppose it wouldn't hurt to keep an eye on them. If he tries anything we can jump in, and I will smite him in the name of the Light."<br/><br/>Dalfein just smiled, and shook his head, he always accompanied the paladin on this journey, mostly because he didn't want him to get himself killed, the death knight knew that Illis' "injury," was mostly in his head, and in his heart. The death knight decided this righteous deed was probably safer, than slaying undead, s othey continued to watch the pair, just in case.

The Sindorei mage awoke slowly, enjoying the warm coccoon that Zyss and herself had woven around themselves sometime in the wee hours of the morning. The pretty little warlock was snuggled against Wyntar with her back to her, while Wyn's arms were wrapped around the soft body of Zyss.<br/><br/>Wyn barely remembered what had happened last night, but her heart's desire lay beside her and in her mind that was a good thing. She slowly leaned in to softly kiss Zyss' bare shoulder, and gently squeezed her lover in a warm embrace. The warlock moaned quietly, and rolled to face the mage who held her so securely.<br/><br/>Zyss kissed Wyn tenderly, and snuggled her head on the mage's shoulder. She whispered faintly, "Good morning...love. Did you sleep well?"<br/><br/>Wyn's voice was soft as well, "Zyss...my sweet Zyss..." and softly kissed the soft locks of hair on the top of her head. "I slept quite well, when I...we finally did sleep."<br/><br/>Zyss nodded into the mage's shoulder, she chewed her lower lip a moment, "Wyn...?"<br/><br/>"Yes, love?"<br/><br/>"I liked what we did last night..."<br/><br/>"I'm glad, Zyss. but...?"<br/><br/>"I still love Kreindis, Wyn...and I now think I love you too."<br/><br/>"Shh, Zyss, shh." The mage closed her eyes, her heart beating faster. She loves me too! Wyn drew a long steady breath, and let it out slowly, as a sweet smile grew on her lips.<br/><br/>"Wyn? Are you alright? I can hear your heartbeat..."<br/><br/>"I'm fine, dear, it's just, that I have longed to hear you say that for so long."<br/><br/>"That I loved you?"<br/><br/>"Yes, my Zyss, for I have loved you so much for so long."<br/><br/>The kiss was tender as the warlock rose from Wyn's shoulder, her arms began to close around the mage's body. As she pulled away briefly she whispered softly, "I think I have known that too, I was just slow in returning it." Her soft lips kissed the mage again, and Wyn moaned as they began a new day much more differently than yesterday.

<em>The morning was beautiful in its beginning, and the old sindorei priest found some sort of relief in that. He had spent a long day in Honeydew healing and helping refugees from the terrible war that affected all of Pandaria. Brewmistress Kiki had finally pulled him away from the multitude of injured and dying. She worried for him and about him.<br/><br/>The pandaren lay him in the bed and covered him, even as he fell asleep on the pillow. "Azmos, dear Azmos, where have you been, my dear. I have missed you, and thought of you fondly, lo these past few months." Kiki softly kissed his forehead, as he snored deeply in his exhausted slumber.<br/><br/>Now he sat at a table, a pot of hot tea and a sugar cake beside him untouched, and a worn journal opened to the last few pages.</em><br/><br/>I want to rush to her side. I want to hold her in my arms and kiss her soft lips. Light, I want her so much. <br/><br/>I have heard that absence makes the heart grow fonder, if so then I am full of fondness. Moreso, I am full of love for Hani. I miss her dearly. Her smile, her touch, the gentle lilt of her voice and the way she looks at me with love.<br/><br/>A part of me wants to go to her, and the other part of me holds back. It has only been a few short days, I must contain myself and my deep affections for my pretty songbird. <br/><br/>I have freed my love, if in time she returns, our love will be that rare and delicate bird that needs never be caged again. <br/><br/>Light, I pray for her safety and her protection.

Light from the sun managed to find its way into the darkness of the tent. A beam hit Mina’s face, the warmth and brightness causing enough discomfort to wake her. Moaning she tried to roll over but found her self tangled in the arms of a handsome warlock. <br/><br/>“Riavis.” Mina breathed his name in a near silent whisper. They had fallen to sleep together, wrapped up in each others arms. His breath warmed her neck and sent a shiver straight through her. It was a pleasurable feeling. Gently the woman brushed hair from his face so she could gaze upon it. She thought the color there had returned and he seemed more at ease. Or perhaps it just seemed that way in the dimly lit tent. Mina’s lips gently brushed his forehead.<br/><br/>The Silver Tongued Devil was fast asleep, and Mina was hungry. Not just for food, though her stomach growled more loudly. She gently detangled herself from Rivi and began to look for her pack and shoes. <br/><br/>While she searched her mind replayed the conversation from last night. Rivi’s promise, his revelation, his words… Truth be told, in the light of mid morning, Mina did not know what to make of it. Could she handle sharing him until Vivieka had her fill? Would he be the same man she knew now?<br/><br/>The doubt and uncertainty that had crept into her mind in the evening returned. Mina bit her lip and stared down at Rivi with a lost expression. Why did she want this so bad? Why did she want him so much? Mina had flings…not relationships and with good reason. <br/><br/>A soft sigh escaped her lips; Mina had made up her mind about one thing. She would see where this temptation would lead, but for now she needed to clear her head. <br/><br/>Silently and gracefully Mina went to a brazier and then quietly slipped out into the daylight. <br/><br/>At the brazier a beautiful flower made of fire bloomed. It’s petals continuously growing, falling and changing shape. The flower rotated slowly without ever leaving the confines of the brazier. The fire flower, sustained by magic, would be there when Riavis awoke…

The morning sun blazed across his face before Riavis woke up. He moved an arm to block it, then looked down at the hollow where she had lain beside him all night. She was gone, but the scent of her lingered and he buried his face in the pillow where she had laid her head when it was not nestled in his shoulder. <br/><br/>He had slept long and was well rested, he was still uncertain where this would go. He knew better than to rush someone. Especially himself. He stretched and got out of the furs, reaching for his armor. He had slept in his clothes and they were wrinkled. But he did not have time to do anything about it. A messenger arrived with a note from Vivi.<br/><br/>Thanking the messenger he got his things and headed for her tent. He was afraid she would want him for something he was not sure he was ready for. To his surprise she smiled and offered him breakfast.<br/><br/>"I have a task for you, I need something from the Badlands. Actually from Uldamun if you can get in. It is a component for a construction I have going in my mansion in Silvermoon. It should not take you long. Here is some gold, hire some help if you need it." she dismissed him with a nod as he stood there in shock a moment.<br/><br/>"That's all? You want some rock from Uldamun and I am just your Go-fer?" he stared at her a moment then turned to walk away.<br/><br/>Her voice stopped him before he got far. "Make sure you are back in time to rehearse with your friends. You had a day off and a good nights sleep. I will see you later."<br/><br/>He nodded and continued out the door, mumbling something about fighting fire with fire.

<em>Early that morning -</em><br/><br/>Az played a sweet melody on the recorder, one that he never heard before, but it stirred his emotions and somehow it reminded him of Hahnai. He let the tune flow through him, and then he set the instrument down as lyrics flowed through his mind, and his deep mellow voice began to sing, "Somewhere, out there, beneath the pale moonlight, someone's thinking of me, and loving me tonight..."<br/><br/><em>Late that evening -</em><br/><br/>The pull had been so strong, that he could not fight it, and he followed his heart. The Light directed him from the far away land of Pandaria to a familiar street and park in Silvermoon. As he strolled the street he heard a familiar melody being played on a lute, and a beautiful voice sang the song he had heard. He came around to see Hahnai sitting on a bench.<br/><br/>As she played the tune, he found his voice rising up to join hers, "Somewhere, out there, someone's saying a prayer, that we'll find one another, in that big somewhere out there..." She stopped and cried out his name. She wrapped her arms around him, even as he embraced her close to himself. Tear welled in his own eyes, as he saw the ones falling from her own, and she began kissing him all about the face.<br/><br/>Finally their lips met in a long tender kiss that lingered as they held each other in the Royal Exchange Park under a tree, with golden leaves falling all about them.<br/><br/>This was the melody they found they shared over a vast distance, and brought them back together in each other's arms -<br/><br/>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkI-B2JWSZI<br/><br/>Somewhere, out there,<br/>If love can see us through,<br/>Then, we'll be together,<br/>Somewhere, out there<br/>Out where...dreams, come true

The sounds of laughter woke Vivi from her nap. She had left her mansion in Silvermoon while the work was being done. Thunderbluff was a rustic haven, she had to settle for simple sleeping arrangements in a tent. She turned over and gazed at the sleeping Sindorei next to her. He had been an amusing companion, who now snored like a rutting pig. She nudged him and he woke up, groggy and mumbling. "Wha.?.. hmmm ok...I am up..." he mumbled as he threw off covers and reached for his clothing.<br/><br/>"Go and find some breakfast. I will talk to you later." she smiled at him as he grinned and left. Her mind drifted to Riavis. She knew he had someone in his tent. It made no matter to her. As long as he could perform with the rest she would not bother him. Her brow wrinkled as she remembered the task she had set for him. <br/><br/>The crystal sat on her table and glowed softly. One of many components she would need to set up her latest experiment. Calling something larger from the Nether was not easy. It required a bit of finesse as well as discretion. She would need several more Crystals and some security in place. But the idea of setting up a show with a display of fireworks from the Nether intrigued her.<br/><br/>It should be relatively harmless, just a light show actually. Images of demons, not the real thing...it might frighten some...intrigue others...it would be a show none would soon forget. Her mind turned to Illis. What a self righteous paladin! She grinned as she remembered his backing down to her. She would use him, yes, but not in the way they thought. He would be the next one to receive an assignment. <br/><br/>She needed a Holy Relic. Something she could add to the matrix she would have in place to secure her summoning. Everything had to be just right. The show must go on, and she needed something spectacular to end it. To make them all remember...yes...all would remember the summoning.

How amazing a difference one day can make! Rivi woke with a weight on his chest, blinking sleepy eyes he reached up to brush hair from his face. There was a slight start as he realized the weight was someone sprawled across him. The bright red lock of hair was connected to Mina! A wave of tenderness swept him then as he moved his head just enough to gaze down at her sleeping form. The elegant sweep of her body pressed against him. Her even breathing and steady heartbeat reassured him she was very much alive and well.<br/><br/>His hand gently stroked the soft silkiness of her back. How had he gotten so lucky? He remembered watching her dance with the flames. Hearing her laughter and that sultry voice enticing him. He swallowed with nervousness, was this the beginning or just a casual fling? His emotions warred with his usual steel control. <br/><br/>The sun was just peeking into the tent from overhead...OVERHEAD? By the Light! What time was it? Close to noon? Gently he wormed his way out from under her and covered her with the blanket. Grabbing his trousers and shirt he ducked outside to find a messenger just about to enter. "Excuse me, Master Riavis, a message for you from Lady Blacktalon." the young tauren might have been shocked to find his tent occupied by a lovely mage, but then again, he might be getting used to the Sindorei by now.<br/><br/>"Yes, thanks. I will go and see her now." Rivi glanced at the tent. No time to leave a message for her. He ran to the pond and cleaned up, his morning routine always made the Tauren chuckle at him. He grabbed a Tauren messenger and gave him the task of picking some flowers for Mina and delivering them. "But do not disturb her, wait until she wakes up!! All right? Here is a gold for your time. Tell her Rivi sends his love and will be back later. Got that?" the Tauren brave nodded solemnly and left to find the flowers.<br/><br/>He ran to Vivi's tent and went in. Not surprised she smirked at him. "It's about time you got up...I have another task for you. This time in the Scarlet Monastery. There is a book there, Kil'Jaden's Monologue. I want it before the fools destroy all that research. I will let the others know. Now go it's already late in the day." and she dismissed him with a wave of her hand.<br/><br/>"Yes, Ma'am. I will get right on it." he said crisply and then went out the door. Sighing with regret he vowed to write Mina a note when he got to the Eastern Kingdoms and let her know he was thinking of her.

<span class="underline"><em><strong>Thursday Morning</strong></em></span><br/><br/>Mina’s eyes slowly opened to the warm rays of the sun. She reached out to touch Rivi but found only empty space where he had been. A pout formed on her face, she had hoped for a more passionate start to the day. Though judging by the light of the sun it was already well into the afternoon.<br/>
Moaning softly Mina pulled herself out of bed and began the search for her robes. The memories of the night before whirled through her brain. Rivi had matched her prowess in everyway and she was smirking at the thought. How they had managed to not burn down his tent was a mystery.<br/><br/>Dressed and ready to go out into the day Mina pulled back the flap of the tent and nearly ran straight into a Tauren.<br/><br/>The large, bored looking brave thrust a bouquet of flowers at her. “For you from Rivi. He sends his love.”<br/><br/>Gingerly Mina took the flowers and inhaled their sweet scent. She looked up curiously at the Tauren. “How long have you been standing here long.”<br/><br/>“Long enough.” The brave responded gruffly though there was humour in his eyes.<br/><br/>Mina’s brilliant laugh echoed throughout Spirit Rise. “You are too kind, even if he did pay you.” She reached up and gave the Tauren a peck on his hairy cheek and wandered off to her own tent. The dancer had herbs to gather, tomes to read and junk Vanwe had sent her to appraise. <br/><br/>The day had already begun and Mina was far behind schedule…

The sky was dimming as he finally made his way to the old Scarlet Monastery. He rode his felsteed to the road traveled by deathguards. Their report was dire. The Scarlets were set on destroying all the evidence of their demonic infiltration. Sylnanus had sent troops in to help them dismantle the libraries, of course they knew to save what they could for the benefit of the Apothecaries and the mages.<br/><br/>Riavis glanced behind him at the deathguards he had hired. They were capable soldiers, a warrior with scarred body and armor rode ahead of the bulk of them. The yellow eyes of the Forsaken bored into his. There was not much the old warrior had not seen. A veteran of many wars, before and after his death. Being raised into Sylvanus army had given him a new way of life. He embraced it with gratitude to the Dark Lady.<br/><br/>"We will go in the front door, the way has already been cleared somewhat. Though I do not doubt reinforcements will be sent. After you, Captain Jordan." Riavis was content to let the Captain lead the way into the main building. He followed behind, not even calling for his demonic servants yet. He was not going to unless he needed to.<br/><br/>The eerie halls were scenes out of nightmare. Bodies strewn about, books and treasured art were looted, not much was left. The Forsaken carried bodies out for reanimation. Nothing was wasted in the eyes of the Forsaken. Rivi delved deeper into the buildings, seeking the library of Doan. Vivi had told him what tome she wanted, but he had a few he wanted to find as well.<br/><br/>Riavis was startled at the sound of dogs. The last of the Scarlets were still locked in struggles with the Forsaken troops. Trained wardogs howled as whips cracked. Riavis cringed as he thought of Kass, she would be furious if she saw and heard the treatment these hounds got. He moved cautiously, sending troops ahead of him to scout. It was easy to see the Scarlets were not giving in easily. Through the halls he walked alone, the fighting now behind him. <br/><br/>The library was just ahead, Rivi could see flames and his heart leapt a moment as he thought of Mina. The fiery mage had matched his passion, the night had been glorious. His attention strayed as he remembered how she had drove him to heights he had never achieved before. His body twitched in a longing he had to return to her. Yes, he must hurry and find the tome and get out of .... (Sap)<br/><br/>He awoke in a daze, his head spinning. A familiar voice and a touch that sent shivers down his spine. "Mina? What are you doing here?"

Sunlight touched Mina’s hair, the effect making it seem like fire come to life. The mage had finished her training and had spent most of the day gathering herbs and reflecting on the events of the last few days. <br/><br/><em>Cruasders, artefacts, rehearsals, fairs, missing deck of cards and love. Yes it had been a busy few days.</em><br/><br/>Not far from Thunderbluff, Mina dried her herbs and turned her face to the sky. The warmth from the sun soothed the inner turmoil of her heart.<br/><br/><em>Riavis had revealed what he was a warlock on the night of their first passionate embrace. She had suspected Vivieka and was not surprised she was teaching him. But the thought unnerved her for two reasons. One, was control really the only thing Rivi was learning? And two, were his recent late night walks leading him into Vivi’s bed? If not, was the reason something more sinister?<br/><br/>The promises, compliments and words Mina’s lover used were often enough to silence her mind and to seduce her into the belief that whatever this relationship was between them could work. Even so jealousy and fear warred in Mina’s heart. Jealousy was not an emotion Mina was used to. She never had problems keeping adoring men at her side. Perhaps she was losing her touch? Fear on the other hand, that was something Mina knew all to well. <br/><br/>Fear of betrayal leading to heart break. Of course the betrayal her thoughts dwelled upon went deeper than a mere broken heart. The man who shattered Mina’s faith in love was named Firnen. Mina gave her heart and body to the man, and in the most terrible ways imaginable he sought to conquer her mind and soul. Were it not for her sister and uncle’s intervention Mina would’ve fallen into darkness…</em><br/><br/>The dancer stood, and washed her hands in a nearby creek. Letting the cool water run over them and shaking off the memories of the mane she preferred to keep nameless. Mina sprinkled some water on to her face then sprawled out in the grass.<br/><br/><em>Like a moth to flame Mina was drawn to Riavis. His every hurt, his vulnerability, his laugh…Mina allowed him to strum her heart strings as finely as he did his guitar. The ease in which she was falling for him often disturbed and confused her. Riavis was a good man; of this Mina had no question. But if Mina wanted to be with Riavis fully would have to let him into her heart…could she forget her old wounds? </em><br/><br/><strong>'If Riavis discovers the depths of my uncertainty…the horror of my past…will he leave?' </strong>Mina felt a pang in her chest imagining the fallout. <br/><br/>A buzz vibrated in Mina’s pockets, shaking her out of the gloom of her mind. <br/><br/><strong>“Mina, I got your message. What’s so urgent?”</strong> Vanwe’s voice sounded distant and tired. <br/><strong><br/>“My cards are missing.”</strong><br/><br/><strong>“You mean the deck Firnen bought you.”</strong> There was a hard edge to the womans voice. <strong>“Good. You know what they say about holding on to the past-“</strong><br/><br/><strong>“That’s not the point-“</strong><br/><br/><strong>“I know love, I know.” </strong>Vanwe pauses on the other end. <strong>“Are you certain it was him?”</strong><br/><br/><strong>“This no coincidence.” </strong>Mina breathes. <strong>“I need to know where he is.”</strong><br/><br/><strong>“He means to see you suffer Mina, especially after what you did to his face…”</strong> Vanwe trails off. Then says brightly. <strong>“No worries! I will find out everything about him that I can love.” </strong><br/><br/><strong>“Thank you.” </strong>Mina whispered on the verge of tears. <br/><br/><strong>“Anything else I can do for you today milady?” </strong><br/><br/><strong>“Vanwe…be cautious.” </strong><br/><br/><strong>“Ha!”</strong> The communication stone goes silent.<br/><br/>A cloud passes over the sun and Thunderbluff’s drums sound, tolling the time. She would have to meet Kass and the others soon for practise. The thought of Illis and Kass locking lips makes Mina a grin and rekindles her fire.<br/><br/>Packing up Mina made her way back to the bluff. Her friends had a way of making her forget her troubles and she could not wait to see them again!

A whistling sound, not high pitched but as soft as a whisper sliced through the air. The masked rogue wiped blood off her sword, sheathed it in a swift smooth movement and turned around to survey her work. <br/><br/>Blood spatter coated the jungle trees of Stranglethorn and would soon attract all manner of creatures. The lifeless eyes of her victim stared up at her from his detached head. The woman lifted the head and placed it on a boulder. “Nothing personal mate, you’re just the unfortunate soul who holds…held…was once in possession…” The masked figure shakes her head. “You were just plain unlucky. Anyway thanks for giving me what I needed.”<br/><br/>The rogue loots her victim’s corpse. Gingerly taking what coin the man had and fades into the shadows of the forest. Leaving the remains of a human male to be devoured by the wildlife…

Mina lay with her head propped up by one arm. She was watching Rivi as he slept. The woman could feel the dopy grin on her face. The affection Mina felt for this man was overpowering and she was beginning to discover that she would do just about anything for him. Her free hand brushed his skin gently. <br/><br/>The woman knew the time was coming to share her deepest darkest secret. That it would be better to tell him first rather than later. In hopes he would understand that any reactions she had to his more disturbing Warlock abilities were just that, a reaction. Mina did not fear Riavis. She feared the memories that would be dredged to the surface and the emotions and reactions they would bring, she wanted him to be prepared for the feelings she could not control. <br/><br/>Rivi needed to know the reasons behind those reactions. This was not a discussion she wanted to have. Mina didn’t share her feelings or her past openly and the walls she built around her heart were high and thick. Knowing the both of them the conversation would move to the bedroom before going too far. They seemed to enjoy using passion as an escape from more serious thoughts and questions. Not that Mina minded, but this conversation was one that needed no interruptions if she intended on giving Rivi her heart. <br/><br/>Mina mouthed <em>‘I love you.’</em> and grinned wider realising she meant it, though perhaps she was not ready to say it out loud just yet. Mina snuggled closer to her lover and fell into a deep sleep.

Sprawled out on a cot an extremely large and rather scarred Sin’dorei male slept soundly. Dreaming of a young and fine Farstrider and the witch he met the night before. Metal rattled and he groaned and rolled over. Something skittered away out from under his flimsy blanket.<br/><br/>“Revion.” A plate clad guard growled.<br/><br/>“Get lost blondie.” <br/><br/>“Get up and get out.” The cell door screeched and whined as it opened.<br/><br/>The man let out a monstrous yawn, accompanied by a belch and stood. The blanket fell from his body and in that moment the guard seemed to turn a faint green colour. Revion scratched his chest. “What the fel is your problem?”<br/><br/>The guard motioned to his face and arms. “You got…something…” Seeing the unimpressed look on Revions face, the gaping guard shook his head dismissively. “N-nothing. You’re fine…you look…great even.” The guard produced an unconvincing smile and tossed the prisoner his pack; he seemed reluctant to enter the cell. “Your weapons can be gathered at the front desk.”<br/><br/>Revion was used to this sort of reaction, he was ugly. Some might even say terrifying to the eye. Scars stretched all over his frame from years of bloody battling. The warrior grunted and walked away trying to remember the events of the night before. <br/><br/>A sucker for a smile, Revion grinned at the memory of the young Farstrider. He was a monster and he knew it, so when a pretty little thing like that gave him a meaningful smile it meant everything. Bryah didn’t know it, but that show of kindness without pity regardless of intent earned her a friend for life. Revion would likely do just about anything for her if she asked…well almost anything. Sometime after he left the bar Revion ended up getting into a fight and thrown into jail. The witch and her boy had put him in a brawling mood. Some poor lesser noble said the wrong thing at the right time and the monster came out swinging. Rev figured Whisper could handle herself and didn’t require back up. So he punched the idiots face in. It took ten guards to bring him down. Revion’s personal best was thirty; he couldn’t help but wonder if he was getting too old for that sort of shenanigans.<br/><br/>The man laughed at his own thoughts and picked up his weapons from the clerk. Again he noticed that everyone was looking at him with a sort of disgust. Most of these people had arrested him before, it’s not like he was new here. Shrugging he walked outside and caught his reflection glass. Revion glared down at his arms and legs, spinning around in circles to see the damage. His body was covered in large, itchy swollen bug bites. Lady Maneater’s last words to him came to mind. “That b-!”

The mage sat on the small couch in their apartment, she wrung her hands and tears kept coming to her eyes. The light hankie she held was damp, and could hold no more tears. She waited for her love to return. <br/><br/>She had packed and sent all her things to another destination. She would not be returning to Silvermoon for quite some time, if ever. Wyntar waited for well over two hours, and decided to leave what she wanted to say in a letter. It seemed a coward's way out, but maybe it was for the best.<br/>********************************************************************<br/><br/>My dearest Zyss,<br/><br/>If I should stay, I know I'll only be in your way. And so I'll go, and yet I know, that I will think of you every step of the way.<br/><br/>Bittersweet memories, that's all I have, and all I'm taking with me. So, good-bye, cause we both know that I am not what you need.<br/><br/>I hope life will treat you kind and I hope that you will have all that you ever dreamed of.<br/>I wish you joy and I wish you happiness, but above all this, I wish you love.<br/><br/>I will always love you, Zyss, <br/><br/>Wyn<br/>*******************************************************************<br/><br/>She folded it and put it into a envelope and placed the pretty warlock's name on the front of it. Wyn took one more look around the apartment, then cast her spell. Her eyes damp with tears, and a gentle sob as she exited.<br/><br/>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJVn0hpBVuE

The evening with Kreindis had been wonderful, so much so she stayed with him through the night. They talked and they held each other. She found she loved him so very much. <br/><br/>It was early, the sun had been hardly been up an hour when she finally found her way to the door of their apartment. She sweetly kissed Krei after unlocking the door, and held him close in a warm embrace. She waved good-bye with a promise of getting together later.<br/><br/>There was a chill in the apartment as Zyss took off the light wrap she wore, and she went to the bedroom they shared. But she found the bed empty and an envelope on her pillow with her name on it. <br/><br/>For some reason a sense of dread came over Zyss as she picked up the envelope. She opened it and tears filled her eyes as she read it. She wandered through the apartment, soft calling out Wyn's name. Then she noticed that many of Wyntar's books were gone, and that the closet was nearly empty also.<br/><br/>The saddened warlock returned to the bed, and re-read the letter. And as fresh tears wet her cheeks, Zyss realized that Wyn knew her so well. Zyss <strong>had</strong> chosen Kreindis over Wyn. And Wyn knew Zyss needed Krei. However, the warlock felt the loss of losing the deep love the mage had given her also. <br/><br/>Zyss lay back on the bed, holding Wyn's pillow close to her. And slowly cried herself to sleep, whispering Wyn's name over and over again.

Assassin, spy, drunk, thief, murderer, pirate, and lastly, a collector of artefacts and antiquities. Once, though briefly, she was even a lover and a friend. Whisper had been a good many things in her roguish career and few people knew her true name, Vanwë Entwhistle. <br/><br/>This black clad rogue used a unique skill set to achieve her goals. Goals that a normal person generally should not be proud of. But today was different. Today the ruffian was on a mission to help one of the few people she could call friend. <br/><br/>Minaethiel had asked her to find information on Firnen that would lead to his location. Vanwë did as she was asked and better. The rogue had found <em>him</em>. Instantly she had contacted Revion and let him on her plan. But the bastard had yet to show up and Whisper could no longer wait. <br/><br/>Wearing the dark robes of the dead servant at her feet, Whisper emerged from the jungle over growth and made for a nearby shack. This would end tonight…
