Just thought you might want this here. I am trying to make this a fun and interesting guild. I encourage all members to post in the Chronicles as a way to keep in touch with all the interesting things happening with us.<br/><br/><a href="../8891619175/index.html" class="bml-link-public">http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8891619175</a><br/><br/>That is previous thread in World's End Tavern. I will keep both updated.<br/><br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>The gentle breezes atop Thunderbluff teased at Vira's hair. It was piled atop her head in a regal style. She strolled among the tents with a confident stride. She had friends here and her gathering of misfits and performers.<br/><br/>She spied Zael speaking with a Sindorei who seemed troubled. Vira watched them walk away with a curious feeling. Would they soon have more members? They needed to replace the acrobat. She felt a twinge of sadness that no one ever really got a chance to know him. He seemed a likeable fellow.<br/><br/>She ordered the high wire dismantled. Speaking to the workers, she told them not to make more of these contraptions unless she approved of them. There were to be safety devices in place. Nothing would disturb customers more than to see someone die. "We need more clowns, more singers and more music. We need fun and distracting entertainment."<br/><br/>She was through with her inspection and went back to her office tent on the Spirit Rise. The tent was quiet. Perhaps she should hire a secretary or at least a clerk to help her with the books. Sitting in the comfortable cushion she had brought from Silvermoon she looked through the applications with interest.

It was an extraordinary thought. She wondered if it could be done? She had heard of their Royal Libraries efforts to inspire such culture as there was among the Sindorei.<br/><br/>Perhaps the Royal Library might be interested in some music and entertainment with their salons? It was worth some thought. She sat down with Zael and asked her opinion. "Do we have any performers who would be ready to do a bit of entertaining?"<br/><br/>Zael grinned, "A course we do! Hahnai and Azmos be good with da music and singin', dey kin advertise do Cirque to those who might be interested in joinin' us."<br/><br/>Nodding at the troll, Vira sat at her desk then to pen a letter to the Head Archivist at the Royal Library. "Be sure to inform Hahnai and Azmos to be ready to perform. Possibly this Sunday evening. They may wish to figure out a suitable arrangement to entertain."

She could not believe what the troll was telling her. "Vivi wants us to perform where? At some Library? What has a library got to do with music?" her confusion clear on her lovely face.<br/><br/>"Ya, mon! Dey do tings like poetry readin's and culture tings. Vivi tinks ya kin play fer the patrons. Mebbe sometin' like what dey call ambi...ambiants...sometin' like dat. I tink she be right! Ya kin play wit' dat Azmos guy right? Da two of ya make a good team...er duet...it be good advertisin' fer da Cirque." Zael was enthusiastic to say the least.<br/><br/>Hahnai grinned at the trolls lack of culture but her intent was good. "Oh, I get it...Chamber music. Just a background thing that fills the halls with lovely music. I think we can do that. Does she have a date for us or do we have to wait to be invited?" her voice now excited as she thought of playing with Azmos again.<br/><br/>"Vivi be writin' da letter ta offer to do dis ting. It be up ta da Director at da Royal Library ta let us know. Ya best be practicin' so ya kin make a good impresshun." Zael grinned. It was an exciting thought. The Cirque would become known as entertainers, and maybe find a few new performers who wanted to join in.

It was with nervousness that Hahnai approached the Library. She was met with welcome and settled down to speak with the very nice Benoite Dawnsong. There were a few others there, the Greatmother Arjah and a goblin named Gezelda. A fine looking gentle elf named Trenetir was gracious to her and offered her refreshments. There was also a death knight named Fastice who seemed very nervous. <br/><br/>When all settled down she was asked about her music. Hahnai had the sense to bring her lute with her. She got out the beautiful instrument and began playing. She really wished Azmos had been there beside her, but her nervousness vanished as they all seemed entranced by the music. <br/><br/>She began with the Lament of the Highborn and the tone of the music seemed to be a bit sad. She was asked for something lively and she responded with a few tavern songs that had the goblin up and dancing.<br/><br/>As the evening wore on she entertained them and was rewarded with some compliments. Miss Dawnsong seemed impressed enough to invite her to play this Sunday. She could hardly wait to tell Azmos! Details were not yet set, so she would have to wait to hear where they would be playing, but she hoped Azmos could join her. She knew his skills as a performer were as good as hers. She was not sure she could convince him to sing, but maybe?

It had been a resounding success as far as she was concerned. The wonderful compliments and the well wishes. Hahnai lovingly cleaned the finely crafted lute, the warm cheery finish glowed. The strings were of a strange silvery metal, they never needed tuning. The Royal Library wanted them to perform again in the future, but no date had been set.<br/><br/>She glanced in the mirror and brushed a lock of her auburn hair out of her eyes. Were those dark circles returning? The potions of renewal and nurturing were getting low. She needed to make more. The gathering of herbs was a time consuming process, but her stores were low. Dabbing a bit of lotion over the delicate tissue of her eyes she gazed into the teal depths. <br/><br/>How often does a person look into their own soul and find it lacking? What was she missing? Something told her she needed to continue her search, for music, for answers to the puzzles presented in her dreams...<br/><br/>Her thoughts kept returning to Azmos. He was older and wiser than she, but still did not have all the answers. The Light protected him, made him positively glow with vitality. He never touched the darkness. A pang vibrated through her heart. Maybe she was not meant to be with someone so strong in the Light. Not that she did not absolutely adore him, it just seemed he was often distant to her. As if he was not sure, her use of the Shadow may have sat poorly with him. The quiet guilt assailed her very soul. Perhaps she was driving him away, just by being herself, as awkward and unsure as she was of her place in this world.<br/><br/>The shadow came easily to her fingers, just as did the Light. She strove for balance, using one no more than the other. Shadow was for protection, for keeping the enemy from getting too close to harm her. To frighten them away with visions of horror...her heart pounded...the skills she had picked up in her travels with the trolls and the orcs...even the goblins offered her spells of darkness to use. The powers of the mind were like the delicacy of a surgical instrument. Cutting precisely to excise the bad...removing the cancer...used correctly it was a powerful healing tool.<br/><br/>It could also be used to cause incredible pain and suffering. Touching on nerves that fed nightmares of agony. Delving into the deepest fears and releasing the truth of the very soul. She had watched as a prisoner had been tortured for hours and the results were for naught. Until the priest came and simply looked into the eyes of the human, the poor man screamed for hours, babbling all of the secrets he knew. Nothing was left of him after the priest was through, just a babbling shell of a man who was relegated to Undercity for experiments.<br/><br/>Hahnai shuddered in revulsion. And yet the information gathered had been very valuable. It had turned the tide in a battle and won the victory they sought. Rubbing the bridge of her nose she contemplated. She could follow the mind manipulations the priest had used, he had told her she was a quick study. But she was not sure she could do what he had done.

The recital had gone well. He didn't think he had heard Hanai sing better than she had ever sang. Nor play the lute better before the small crowd of people. The compliments were nice, and Hahnai seemed to glow with pride for a job well done. They had said that they harmonized well together. If they only knew.<br/><br/>Ever since his time with A'dal, he had felt attuned to the Light. It was not merely a tool to be used as so many proclaimed. For he could feel it living within himself, its warmth, its very essence seemed to flow through his veins. And Azmos not only liked it, he loved it. <br/><br/>He had always believed in and held onto the Light. The Light had been a weapon against the onslaught of evil and greed he had come against all his life. The Light had protected him, and healed his broken body time and time again. The Light had been the one constant throughout his life that had been there...through every trial and tribulation.<br/><br/>Azmos had thought he had found another light, a light that lit up his heart, and thrilled his emotions like no other had ever before. He had found love in the form a teal-eyed bard with a voice unlike anything he or anyone else had ever heard before. <br/><br/>Harmony with a thread of discord. She worked in the Shadow. She felt its power and used it to protect and to defend herself. And it was creating a gap, a chasm, between them. He found it more and more difficult to be by her side. And he felt the pain of that distancing.<br/><br/>Something was eating her up from the inside out. She looked thin, and worried like a great dog had held her and shook her like a ragdoll. There were the voices, and there was...the book. Azmos felt she was moving further and further away from the light. And deeper and deeper into the Shadow. And becoming less the person she had been, or he had fallen in love with.

Drifting through the day she sought the calm of nature and went to the gardens of Silvermoon. The herbs there were not the ones she needed, it forced her to seek out the advice of the herbalist in the Royal Quarter. <br/><br/>"You must seek the harder to find herbs in the North, far to the North in the wilds of Northrend you will find herbs you have never seen. You are to go there and gather them for me. Bring them back and we shall train you more. Be sure to take someone with you, it can get dangerous there. I have heard the Scourge still roam and cause trouble with travelers." she dismissed Hahnai without more to say.<br/><br/>The priest looked in the Halls and asked around for an escort to take her to the rough North. Most all of the trustworthy sort were headed to Pandaria. She was distraught. She wanted to ask Azmos if he would go with her. But she could not find him. <br/><br/>Sitting in the square she watched the various adventurers milling around. Was there no one she could trust to travel with her? No one seemed interested in anything related to the cold north. Hahnai headed back to her apartment alone and sat at her desk. A clean sheet of parchment and the quill pen awaited her. Dipping the long feather quill tip into the black ink she began.<br/><br/>----------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Dear Azmos,<br/><br/>I am heading to Northrend on an expedition to find some rare herbs. I will be gone for awhile. I looked for you to ask you to travel with me, but I must have missed you in the Halls.<br/><br/>I will be all right. The Light is with me as it is with you. With the addition of the Shadow, I know you do not approve, but I am not as strong as you are in the Light. Know that wherever I go you are in my heart and in my mind. I shall miss you with every breath I take and every beat of my heart.<br/><br/>Thank you for sharing your music with me, it sustains me when all has failed to fight back the darkness. Light be with you.<br/><br/>Hahnai<br/><br/>-------------------------------------------<br/><br/>She sealed the letter with a bit of blue wax and sent it off with a messenger. Hopefully he would not feel abandoned by her leaving this way. But she sensed a distance from him in the last few weeks. Perhaps having her gone will remind him of what they had, if he truly cared.

It was a rumor she heard from a friend still in Silvermoon. There was a surge of interest in Cirque. Some fine talent was on its way to audition. Something about a singer, a dancer and some musicians. Vivi paced the tent in front of Zael. "I want to know if it is true, can we get a show together for the next Darkmoon Faire? Seek these people out, Zael. I had hoped to have some clowns ready for an opening act, Cyaer is ill at the moment...I know Leon is ready to announce the acts and maybe...he can be a good straightman for a clown act with Cyaer."<br/><br/>Zael sat on the floor and watched Vivi pace back and forth. "I hear da same rumor. I tink it be dat same guitar playa dat stampede da kodo wit' his screamin' guitar. But maybe not...he be runnin' pretty fast wit' all dem Tauren chasin' him. Ya want me ta go ta Silvermoon and see if it be true?" <br/><br/>Vivi shook her head, "No, I think they are headed here. But if that guitar player is one of them he may need to sneak in...maybe it has been long enough the herder has forgotten. As long as the guitar music he uses is not that raucous noise, he should be ok. We will hold the audition here on the Bluffs, away from the herds anyway. The central bonfire area is a good place or maybe the Spirit Rise right here? There is a small open area here, yes...this should work." she smiled as she envisioned the area as a stage.<br/><br/>Zael walked beside Vivi and chuckled, "It be good, we kin see if dey like da performance from da beginnin'. At least we have a built in audience." she nodded at the workers around the small clearing.

<em>His mind was distraught, and his heart in turmoil as he sat before the desk, a clear piece of paper, and a bottle of black ink and a fine tipped quill. He had thought about what he would write since he had received Hahnai's brief note. Then as he prepared to begin, he hesitated, his long delicate fingers frozen over the paper with pen in hand...</em><br/><br/>My dearest Hahnai,<br/><br/>I have but one thing to say about Northrend, enter with caution and the Light close to your heart. Believe in yourself, and the Light will be strong enough to protect you and guide you in your journey there. May you find the herbs and experiences you seek there.<br/><br/>I am finding that the Light is ever more necesary in Pandaria. My journey and adventure here have been enlightening and kept me evermore dependent upon the Light and the strength it provides me. There is an underlying darkness here, my love...one of a great and terrible power, an evil power. One that permeates the very land of Pandaria.<br/><br/>I cannot deny you that I do not approve the use of Shadow. I am old and set in my ways. I have found the quality of power that the Light provides enough, and do not need to lean on the use of anything but the Light. It is truly sufficient for all you need, if you but trust in it and use it.<br/><br/>Ever since we talked to A'dal, I have had a resurgence of faith in that Light. Hahnai, you don't need the Shadow, you never did. Trust in the Light, it will provide you with all that you need to defeat your foes, heal you, and protect you. <br/><br/>I'll stop my preaching to you. Perhaps I should have talked with you when we were together. Shared with you my life with the Light. I should have done a great many things...<br/><br/>You are and will be in my thoughts and heart, my sweet teal eyed bard. You gave me memories and emotions I have never felt before. We made beautiful music together, didn't we, Hahnai? <br/><br/>I am and always will be your friend. Call on me whenever you need me. Just as your letter found me before, I will answer your call as soon as possible.<br/><br/>You will always have a part of my heart, beloved, I will come when you need me. I will be there for you.<br/><br/>Az

Hahnai sat in the Lounge in Dalaran, the letter from Azmos in her hands. Part of her felt raw and deserted. Was it so easy for him to let her go? Not that his words were harsh, in fact they were kind and gentle, as she expected from him. It was the air of dismissal she felt, as if he had said, "Go your own way, I will not hold you back."<br/><br/>She had never felt so alone. In this harsh land of ice and snow, where undead still found unwary travelers and added to their ranks. It was a tremendous risk for her to travel without an escort. Indeed she had asked for help, but the leers of the men and the dismissal of the women left her cold. She had to do this alone, face her fears and rise above them.<br/><br/>The lounge was nearly empty now, few traveled this land of bitter memories. She took the lute from its case and set it in her lap and began to strum a meloncholy song. <br/><br/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_25z8AoByw<br/><br/>Her song filled the tavern with sadness, she did not even notice when a few coins dropped into her cup. She was lost in the song, strumming the lute and singing her heart out. It was a sign of her heart breaking that she did not even see the tall human that sat beside her and set a glass of snowplum brandy on the table.<br/><br/>"If someone has broken your heart, you need to grieve...then move on...it's not the end of the world." his voice gentle and deep. The dark hair framing his rugged face as his deep blue eyes studied her.<br/><br/>Hahnai turned to gaze at the human, he was handsome in his own way, the dark hair and tanned skin gave him a sincere look. His beard was trimmed and neat. A smile flickered on her lips as she nodded. "Yes...I know...it is hard to let go...part of my life is there. I will never forget his kindness and love. He got me through some rough times. Thanks for the brandy...I think I need it for my throat is dry." Her hand reached out to take the glass, sipping the wonderfully sweet yet tart taste of the northern brew.<br/><br/>"If he has let such beauty slip through his fingers, it is his loss. I would have never let you go." the deep tone of his voice flowed sweetly into her ears. It reminded her of Azmos voice. Deep and mellow...was that going to happen every time she met someone new? To be reminded again and again of what she now thought she had lost. <br/><br/>"What is your name, Stranger? I do not know much of humans. I am Hahnai Dawnsinger." she tried bravely to smile. It might get her an escort in this harsh land, and this one might be capable of protecting her.<br/><br/>"Dave Harlan, at your service, M'Lady. I do not mind buying a drink for a lovely creature such as you." he smiled. It was to his credit she did not see the malice behind his fascade. He made a living seeking out the Horde in Northrend and eliminating their presence. He could not do so openly, but had great success luring them out of Dalaran, where he could do as he pleased.

Ah, what I wouldn’t give to see the look on his face…or that of the rest of my family.<br/><br/>I should be writing more of the circus…perhaps of the handsome paladin named Leon, or the intriguing troll manager Zael. But my mind is far from such things these days. <br/><br/>My mind now rests on my newest friends. Kass, Illis and Riavis. Together we form an exquisite combination of musical and acrobatic talent. Our abilities seem to blend well together, forming a bond I have not felt in years.<br/><br/>It all began with a crude attempt at being Kass’s wingman. I say ‘attempt’ as I am not sure it worked. Kass seems to have her eyes trained on Illis, but that man is a rock. I would spike his drink with a love draft to focus his attention upon her but he does not drink. Perhaps I shall wait and see how their game plays out before I resort to drastic measures? After all I have a game of my own to play.<br/><br/>Riavis. Charm and looks, strange and brilliant. This man has most definitely captured my interest. I cannot be sure, but I believe the feeling is mutual. A connection is there, stronger than with any of the others I have taken interest in. Aside from Him…the first. That knowledge frightens me somewhat, but they are nothing alike as far as I can see. I will not jump to conclusions and question my own judgement. Besides I am having too much fun. <br/><br/>The cards have been dealt and the game has begun…who will be the first to give in? The first to fall? </em><br/><br/>“Mina.”<br/>
“Hmm?” Mina puts down her quill and turns to look at the man lying in her bed. Her fingers entwined in the pendant around her neck. <br/><br/>“I know that smile…who is he?” The man laughs. His body is covered in scars, not even his face is exempt. Though tall and well built, all the beauty of the Sin’dorei has vanished through years of battle and bloodshed. He never understood why a beautiful woman would dare to touch him. “You never smile that way for me.” He half teases.<br/><br/>Mina flashes him a grin and returns to his side and kisses his temple. “Revion, I am smiling for you now.” She purrs in his ear. <br/><br/>“Poor soul…he doesn’t know what he is getting into.” Revion chuckles softly. His eyes narrow slightly. “Be careful…” He falters slightly, trying to look cool and unconcerned but failing miserably. “You know while I’m gone.”<br/><br/>“That is supposed to be my line.” Mina cuddles in close to him. This man is an insane, brilliant and blood hungry warrior. He showed attachment to only a select few, and by some strange twist of fate she ended up one of the few. Perhaps because Mina had showed him affection where most others would have ran in fear, or perhaps because he had saved her life. “Try to not to die out there.”<br/><br/>“I can’t make you any promises sweetheart.” Revion’s voice is nonchalant and strokes her hair gently. “I can only promise I will kill as many Kor’kron as possible.” His gaze went to the bags on the floor of Mina’s tent. “Make sure you only use that in an emergency. I have no problems accidentally blowing up half of Thunderbluff but you should be more cautious.”<br/><br/>Mina laughed and nodded. Revion Bloodhearth would get one last night of passion before heading to war…

From the pages of my journal:<br/><br/>I wrestle with myself. I want to be with her, I have grown accustomed to her embrace and being there to aid her where I could. And therewithin lies the rub.<br/><br/>Hahnai needs to be on her own to grow within herself, and within the Light. What kind of teacher would I be if I let her hang on to my coattails as they say? <br/><br/>Light, I pray I made the right decision. To allow her to become the woman and the priestess she can fully become. She is not a little girl anymore, she needs to learn to walk on her own, and to be...on her own.<br/><br/>It tears my heart out to be away from her but I must refrain from aiding her. Will she realize in time why I did what I did? Or will she grow to hate me for what I have done?<br/><br/>I want so so much to be with her, to see her achieve her independence, to see her stand on her own. She will succeed, she may falter a little, but she has an inner strength within her to let her come out on top.<br/><br/>I shall return to Pandaria, though my heart will always be wherever Hahnai is.<br/><br/>Light bless you, beloved...what I did I did out of love for you.

Thunderbluff was not a very private place. The tents they had been given to sleep in were fairly open. Oh yes you could let down the flap and hope no one would wander by to investigate. Rivi was sure they were curious about him. All they saw was his playful and musical side. None of them as far as he could tell saw the darkness he held back through force of will.<br/><br/>He sat on his bedroll and contemplated Mina. She intrigued him to no end. Her casual flirting and soft lips made his body tingle with desire. It was a surprise when she turned his advances away. Was he not good enough for her bed? She had made no secret of lying with others, not even giving them more than a superficial attachment. <br/><br/>The tent flap was open still as he gazed off into the distance. The odor of fel assailed his nostrils before he saw her. It was faint to most people, unless you were a warlock. The figure came closer and stopped at his tent. The lovely voice came from the shadowed hood as she stood in front of his tent. "Hello Riavis, it's always a pleasure to greet a fellow practitioner of the Art. I am your employer, Vivieka Blacktalon. Is it too late to chat with you a bit?"<br/><br/>Riavis stood and bowed deeply, "I am honored, M'Lady. Please come in and make yourself comfortable. I am not sure I follow you, I do not practice the dark..." he stopped as she walked to him and placed a finger to his lips.<br/><br/>"You do not need to hide it from me. I can see it in your eyes and feel it in the air around you. I understand if you wish to keep it a secret from most. But I am not going to let you hide from me." her hand gently caressed his smooth face and tangled in his hair.<br/><br/>Riavis was stunned and unsure a moment. He had tried to hide it yes, but he had not counted on the owner of the Cirque to be a warlock of such power. Her touch sent shockwaves of sensation through his system. Here was someone who knew what she wanted and was not about to back down.<br/><br/>Like a moth to a flame he felt drawn to her. Her scent and ample curves enticed him. His arms went around her as she leaned close. The night was young yet and he had much to learn. Before the night was through he was spent and weakened. Here was power like he had never felt before. Thoughts of Mina were like a cool breeze compared to Vivieka. What had he gotten himself into?

The human tried very hard to entice Hahnai to his bed. He bought her brandy, he offered her candid advice and many tidbits of information. But she was demure and gently put him off. "My heart is elsewhere. He has his reasons for letting me take this trip alone. Perhaps I am wrong in thinking he has rejected me. I will be true to him."<br/><br/>Dave Harlan was not a man to be put aside easily. He remained charming and gracious to her. "No one who truly loves will let his lover stray so far from home without an escort. He has abandoned you to your fate, he does not care. He has no doubt found another to warm his bed. Trust me in this, he has let you go for a reason, yes. He has other things on his mind, not you." his poisonous lies wormed their way into her mind. The seeds sown for doubt and fear, the better for him to take advantage.<br/><br/>Hahnai laughed at his attempts, she was flattered by his attentions. "You try to hard, I am not interested in anything but gathering my herbs for study and use in my alchemy. I think it is time for me to rest. I will be out in the field all day tomorrow. I have bought warmer clothes and hopefully will find a party willing to allow me in their ranks. I know there are others still seeking treasures here in Northrend. Have a good evening, Dave." And with that she rose to go to her room. <br/><br/>The human cursed silently as she left him. He was not about to let such a tasty morsel slip through his fingers. The more time he had spent with her the more he wanted her. His mind whirled as he thought of those he knew were going out into the wilds. As he sipped the last of his mead he looked around the tavern and spotted an old friend. His lips curled in a smile.

Dalaran, a city in turmoil, much like her heart. The mage found her a safe quiet bar, and sat down to think, and sip on a cool glass of Dalaran white wine. She kept the hood of her cloak up, and kept mostly to herself. <br/><br/>She had been so close, oh so close to having Zyss to herself. She saw how the pretty little warlock looked at her as she quietly walked around the apartment nearly naked, flaunting a variety of new chiffons and pale satin nightgowns that emphasized the mage's beauty. She also saw Zyss gaze at her as she did her hair, then offered to help her with her own tresses. <br/><br/>Wyn had almost treated her like royalty, offering tasty treats and candies, as well as practically fawning over Zyss. The warlock was falling deeper and deeper under Wyn's gentle persuasions, and the light massages were helping Zyss to become acclimated to Wyn's touch, then he had come back...<br/><br/>It wasn't his fault. Zyss still held a strong desire and affection for the paladin Kreindis. And being with him for only an evening had undone all the work Wyntar had tried and plied for the past few weeks. She was heart broken, she gave Zyss some story of going to Dalaran to explore a new possible spell or some such nonsense. In truth, she couldn't bear to hear Zyss go on and on about Krei, when Wyn had wanted to be the talk of Zyss's heart, the one that excited her, and so, she had left.<br/><br/>The cold and wintery conditions of Northrend were almost like home for the frostmage. She had put on insulated stylish clothing and teleported away. Thank the Light for being a mage! <br/><br/>So she sat crying in her wine, and trying to decide what she would do tomorrow, and the next day, and the next to wipe the love and memory of that sexy little vixen out of her heart.<br/><br/>She ordered another wine, and sat back to contemplate her life, and where it was headed.

Mina’s eyes lingered on the door of her tent, long after Rivi had left. She bit her lip with longing. Regret was not something she felt often, but tonight she regretted not letting the man in. The reason Mina had turned Rivi away stepped from the shadows of her tent. “Oooh he was gorgeous…why didn’t you let him stay?”<br/><br/>“Vanwe. I might have known.” Mina smiled and ever light in the tent sprung to life. The mage fell into a pile of cushions that scattered the tent. <br/><br/>“I would’ve thought my constant call over the communication stone was a dead give away!” Vanwe was shorter than most Sin’dorei, with hair the color of moonlight that curled into ringlet’s around the dark skin of her face. Her eyes, the green of a jungle forest, flashed with surprise. “You haven’t bedded him yet?!” <br/><br/>Mina sighed in response. “Have you come all the way from Booty Bay to discuss my love life?”<br/><br/>The other woman laughed, a sound reminiscent of wind chimes. “Perhaps I have, but first I need a drink.” Vanwe wandered over to a cabinet in the tent. Seeming to know exactly where everything was, she reached in and retrieved a bottle of fire whiskey and two crystal shot glasses. “Out with it Mina, usually when you take this long to sleep with a man, it means you’re developing more than just…how do you put it?” She looks up thoughtfully as she pours the whiskey. “A mild interest?”<br/><br/>“At least I have requirements.” Mina scoffs she accepts the glass Vanwe hands her and stares at the liquid. <br/><br/>“Requirements? Ha!” Vanwe sits on the edge of Mina’s bed and drains the small glass then pours herself another. Whiskey bottle dangling in her hand, the woman stares critically at Mina. “I get it, he’s another magic user.”<br/><br/>“Van-“<br/><br/>“You have a type Mina.” Vanwe continued on. Mina shot back her drink and rolled her eyes and the other woman passed her the whiskey bottle. “The last one was a woman wasn’t she? In Undercity? A warlock. She nearly seduced you to your death, a dancer like you I believe?”<br/><br/>Mina groaned and took a long drink straight from the bottle.<br/><br/>“And then before that was the human. Also a warlock, with deep grey eyes…He had a vast knowledge of the history of Azeroth. He had you so captivated-“<br/><br/>“I remember a certain BladeSinger also under his thrall…” Mina took another swig and passed the bottle back to Vanwe.<br/><br/>“-That we were both nearly sold into slavery.” Vanwe took another drink. “And then there is the reason we met! That Sin’dorei bastard who preyed upon you while you were drunk, that was the first night you came to Booty Bay.” She glowered at the tent door. “He had a love of the sea and was a fiercely loyal friend of the First man to ever capture your heart and to truly hold it. He tried to kill you to take vengeance for his friend. The First, your first everything and the reason you fled Silvermoon.” Her gaze fixed on Mina. “All of them warlocks, all of them tried to kill, conquer and/or corrupt you. And the First was the worst of them all. This man, this new man…if he is a magic user it is safe to say he to his a warlock.”<br/><br/>“We don’t know that.” Mina said quietly, she cuddled a pillow to her chest.<br/><br/>“But you suspect, or he would be here right now and I would be out on my !@#$ in Taurenland.” Vanwe took another drink at sat down next to Mina. “You’re afraid.”<br/><br/>“You’re a rogue-“ Mina started.<br/><br/>“A treasure hunter.” Vanwe corrected.<br/><br/>“A pirate.”<br/><br/>“The answer is no.” Vanwe wrapped an arm around Mina’s shoulders. “I won’t dig into his past. This is your own journey, your either going to let him in…or let him go.” Mina took the bottle out of Vanwe’s hand and drank deeply. “My two coppers? Find someone who is boring, the less intrigue the less likely you are to find someone who is going to kill you. Like a fisherman!”<br/><br/>Mina burst into laughter and soon the other one joined in. There were few people Mina showed vulnerability to, her sister, her uncle, Revion and this rogue, Vanwe. They had seen her at her worst and never once judged or condemned her. Unlike her father and other siblings who cast her out. After the laughter died and Mina wiped away her tears she asked. “What is the real reason you are here?”<br/><br/>The rogue frowned. “I went to Silvermoon to see an old friend. I had hoped to entice her with a business proposition. The Farstrider I told you about? She is gone to battle with the rest of her new comrades.” Vanwe sighed looking genuinely displeased. <br/><br/>“Business proposition?” Mina gingerly stroked Vanwe’s hair. “Meaning your going to steal something?”<br/><br/>“Recovering a priceless artefact. I am a treasure hunter.” Vanwe grinned wolfishly.<br/><br/>“You’re a pirate.”<br/><br/>“With a dead captain and no ship.” Vanwe’s grin turned into a pout. “That’s hardly pirate worthy.” The two women laughed and would carry on this conversation long into the night…

The evening had been wonderful, spending a few short hours with her favorite paladin. They had talked and held each other, confident in their love once more. However, like most things, the evening came to an end. Kreindis had walked Zyss to the door of her apartment with the mage Wyntar. They had kissed and she watched him walk slowly away.<br/><br/>The apartment seemed cold and empty without her friend here. And Zyss found herself wandering through the rooms, picking up an item here or there, and setting down something someplace else. She eventually found herself in her own bedroom, and looked at the sheets and blankets all tusselled and unmade. And she shook her head.<br/><br/>The pretty warlock wandered down the hall to the room of the mage, and she looked in. Wyn had left in a hurry and there was very little signs of her coming back in the near future. Zyss moved to the bed, and gently sat down. She looked around the room at all the books, objects, and artifacts the mage had picked up in her journeys.<br/><br/>She laid down, and smelled the gentle fragrance of Wyn's perfume on the pillow. Zyss had grown used to that scent, and she lay her head face first into the pillow, taking a deep long smell of the mage's essence. As she pulled her face away, she began to cry, soft warm tears fell down her cheeks. She missed Wyn, she missed her more than she wanted to admit. Zyss curled into a ball around the pillow, and the scent of Wyn.<br/><br/>She softly cried herself asleep. The night with Kreindis forgotten as she worried and thought of her friend out there alone without her.

She almost ordered another glass of wine, but decided against it, two, well, alright, three were her limit and she wasn't ready to conk out here in some quiet little bar in Dalaran. She had a nice plush bed back at home she could sleep in. She paid her tab, and a generous tip to the bartender as she waved her fingers and arms about...<br/><br/>...finding herself within her own little boudoir. She assumed that Zyss was still out with that paladin of hers, or asleep in her room. She brought the candles up to a gentle glow as she disrobed, and put on a simply wicked nightgown that left nothing to the imagination. It was one of her favorites, what could she say, as she came to stand beside her bed.<br/><br/>Her tired slightly drunken eyes gazed upon the sleeping warlock wrapped around her pillow, and Wyn looked at how soft the warlock's features looked in the glow of the candlelight. And how sweet she appeared cuddling Wyn's pillow. The mage crawled in beside Zyss, and waved the candles out.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was the wine, and she didn't realize what she was doing, or perhaps she did and didn't care, but Wyn wrapped her arms around the other woman in her bed. She snuggled close enjoying what she had often dreamed of, being close to the warlock. She whispered to Zyss how much she loved her, and she kissed the cheeks of Zyss.<br/><br/>Deep asleep, the warlock moved to the warmth that surrounded her, to the security, and the strong scent of the one she had wanted to be with. <br/><br/>And when she turned her face towards Wyn, the mage kissed her. A slow lingering kiss that made Zyss moan in her sleep, and slowly begin to awaken. The warlock sought to embrace the mage close to her, and when Wyn kissed her again, Zyss returned the kiss. A soft tender kiss that excited the warlock, and the mage.

The road to ruin begins with a kiss…<br/><br/>Mina’s motto passed through her head as she sat in blackened circle of singed grass outside of Thunderbluff. <br/><br/>After she said goodnight to Rivi and Kass the dancer had not returned to her tent. She hadn’t been tired, Mina could’ve sat and drank and laughed with them well into the wee hours of the morning. But her mood had changed throughout the course of the night and she had needed a release. <br/><br/>Rivi’s playing evoked thought and emotion from her that no other could. It was almost unsettling. For it was not the kind of magic meant to control or deceive, Mina knew all to well what it felt like to have that imposed upon her. Her thoughts were confused; she should’ve felt relief that Rivi had found another to occupy his time. But his jabs at sleeping alone had angered her. Though to say she was angry at him would be a lie. Mina was angry at herself, for letting their little game get to her, for not taking him to her bed, angry that Kass’s outlook on love made her long for it and angry for ignoring the truth. Warlock or no, she wanted Rivi to be hers, knowing the dangers that involving herself with warlocks usually brought. <br/><br/>Those thoughts are what brought her out on to the plains of Mulgore. The mage panted heavily, and again got to her feet beginning the dance once more. Any living thing that came close on this night would have been engulfed in the passion, anger, sadness and even excitement that her flames created. The emotion she could bring to life with her flames knew no bounds and Mina let her power flow full and raw. Incinerating anything within the small radius in which she moved. Walls of flame encircled her and within sparks flew up from the ash under her feet. This dance went on until the first rays of the sun hit Thunderbluff. <br/><br/>Mina allowed her fire to dissipate, the emotion she needed to release now gone. Entering her tent, the woman shrugged out of her robes and sliding a thin silken nightgown over her body she began to get ready for bed. Mina’s tired eyes fell upon the guitar sitting alone in corner. <br/><br/>Sleep would not come to her today. Mina went to the guitar and picked it up. The memory of that night at the beach with Rivi danced through her mind. Balancing it on her lap she began to strum it softly and a lonely tune drifted from it. <br/><br/>The woman had hoped to surprise Rivi and the others. She had been practising for sometime. But now she felt as though this was her secret. As she played Mina decided the game was over. Rivi had won and Viveka could have him. Though Mina doubted her ability to resist the Silver Tongued Devil, every time she danced it was for Rivi. She would have to put a distance between herself and Rivi. Or just take her lumps and let the cards fall where they may…<br/><br/>Vanwe had been right…the next man she invested her time in would have to be a boring fisherman.<br/><br/>Mina let out a long drawn out sigh and began to add words to the song she strummed…<br/><br/>((http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkCYMhAr-_0))

Thunderbluff was a busy place. Many had taken refuge here since Orgrimmar had become so hostile. Gini was busy with her leathercrafting. She had never had so many orders, it stressed her she could hardly have time to herself. With a sigh she set the beading basket aside and got up to stretch. She needed to unwind, to soar in the air as a stormraven. <br/><br/>Jana stepped in about that time and greeted the tauren, "Gini, take a break for Light's sake. Go and find that lovesick brave who has been circling the bluffs. I can take over here, most of this stuff is well within my range." she giggled as Gini blushed.<br/><br/>"Jana, you read my mind! How did you know? Yes! I need a break. And some new skins. I am almost out of light hides. If anyone comes looking for goods send them out to gather hides! Perhaps I will find Jakota. I do not know if he even remembers me. He is such a handsome brave. He must have many seeking his attention." she seemed almost heartbroken.<br/><br/>The elf threw a pillow at Gini, "Get going!! He has been circling the bluffs for days looking for you! He likes you, now go and find him!" She sat on the finely woven blanket and began working on some bracers, chuckling to herself.<br/><br/>Gini ducked the pillow in confusion. "He what? No you must be mistaken, he is only kind because I am part of the Cirque. I made him a shirt, he thanked me, yes. He seemed to like it. But maybe he has been to busy to think of me..." she stood in the doorway for a moment. Glancing over at Jana as the elf picked up another pillow. <br/><br/>"All right!! I am going..I might run into him..." Gini giggled and shifted forms. With the grace of the stormcrow she flew high into the air, circling the bluffs, seeking the thermals to send her even higher. Her eyesight was greatly enhanced in this form. Scanning the hills she searched, floating in graceful arcs as she circled.
