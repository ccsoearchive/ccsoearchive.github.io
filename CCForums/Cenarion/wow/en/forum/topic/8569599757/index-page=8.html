Fynnariel floated peacefully in the Thondroril River, her newest pet Varrah watching from the shore. The water was lifeless and dead, but it was cool and smelled normal. For bathing purposes, it did the job. Varrah snorted the way boars do, but otherwise seemed at ease. She was a ghost, a spirit animal. Fyn found her quite by accident, or more accurately Varrah found her. <br/><br/>The huntress breathed out a long sigh of contentment. Though, Varrah’s entry into her life was not the event she was reflecting on: <br/><br/><em>Yesterday, I had travelled to Eversong. To mine some copper veins and relax while fishing. Much to my surprise I met Zyss! The woman was practicing her fishing skills, alone at Stillwhisper Pond. <br/><br/>I joined her and the two of us sat and enjoyed some conversation. Zyss seems really kind; she has a good heart I think. Again I was surprised at how easy it was to open up to someone I hardly know. Normally I am quiet, and when I do open my mouth it’s full of “Uh’s and um’s”. <br/><br/>She, like Rian, is originally from the Ghostlands. I cannot help but feel a pang of guilt when others mention it. The Farstriders failed, they were unable to hold back the Scourge. I was among those that fell while defending our lands… <br/><br/>Zyss confided in me with some reservation that she is a Warlock. My reaction or lack there of, surprised her. I can understand why. Farstriders are not known to be forgiving, or lovers of Magic of any kind, let a lone Fel Magic. But I do not judge people on what they are, but by the deeds they do and the hearts that drive them. For I am far from perfect, I have more than enough of my own personal demons to know better.<br/><br/>She asked me if everyone in the Fellowship is this understanding, I told her in all honesty that I didn’t know, but they must be. There are Death Knights and people of all sorts in this group. How could they not accept those from all walks of life?<br/><br/>Soon after we were joined by another…Fel what was his name again? Something like Zanrim? I think he said he was related to Kel and Cyaer. He’s a Farstrider like me and he has a beautiful arcane serpent! Wings liked the creature well enough. <br/><br/>Zanrim is a tad odd…kept insisting that Zyss and I were she-devils. The situations that arose from our conversation with him were quite entertaining. Oblivious is the best way to describe me when it comes to male advances. At least that’s what one of my old comrades, Bainor, used to say to me before the Third War claimed his life. I think he was right…because Zyss had to explain to me what was happening! <br/><br/>Highly embarrassing! <br/><br/>Carinoth and I made a promise of sorts…to try to be more than friends. Rather than swim like Zanrim suggested, I left soon after Zyss. I can’t be skinny dipping alone with random males! At least I don't think I can...I'm unsure of the proticol but I think I did the right thing in leaving.<br/><br/>That reminds me…I forgot all about the copper I was supposed to mine! I guess I will be returning back to Eversong soon enough…</em><br/><br/>Snapping out of her reverie Fynnariel swam to shore and sprawled out on a rock to dry, she dozed happily in the sunlight. Thinking of how great it was to have spoken to Zyss and to finally meet someone who would be a good a friend, and idly wondering where Zanrim got his arcane serpent…

The sands of the beach where my ancestral home was once located were usually empty. It was a nice quiet place to stroll and watch the sunset. Finding bits of driftwood tossed on the beach with the tides was all I usually found. <br/><br/>Imagine my surprise to find two Sindorei sitting on the beach and watching the sunset. I hesitated to approach, I did not want to interrupt anything. Romance for me has long since lost its appeal. But I do not wish to stop others from enjoying it. <br/><br/>They seemed friendly enough and I stopped to chat. We were soon joined by a hunter who was obviously coming on to me. I tried to be polite about it, but I am not interested in settling down. Why is it a male sees a female alone and automatically assumes they want to hook up?<br/><br/>I was thinking of leaving when more people showed up! I swear I might have to open a concession stand at this rate. The old beach has not had this many people walking on it in a long time. I know the mansion where my family made their home is long gone, but I still feel a bit proprietary over it. I asked them to make sure they cleaned up any leftover garbage and I did not mind them using the beach.<br/><br/>They asked my about my runes and I was about to explain, but so many questions were flying around in the conversation I really doubt anyone was interested. It would take a long time to tell them about it. Maybe another time.<br/><br/>I like this Fellowship idea. They all seem friendly enough. I am just one more warrior in their midst I am sure. I have yet to meet this Master they speak of. I wonder where he is?

Entry 7 - Fairbreeze Village<br/><br/>I had gone to talk to the proprietor of the inn when I overheard a conversation. Normally I disregard idle chatter, but I heard a very distinctive voice that I shall never forget, Leon. As soon as I heard his voice I moved to where I could overhear, and what I heard sickened me.<br/><br/>I had learned in my eavesdropping on Leon and Hal at the Darkmoon Faire, that Leon still held a torch for the woman Narella. Well, here she was flaunting a new husband and it seemed to me she was rubbing Leon's nose into the fact she was married and oh so freaking happy. And my Leon still stayed the gentlemen, and didn't fall into their quips and crap.<br/><br/>I came down to talk with Leon, and I probably didn't come off very nice to his Narella or her new husband. But damn it, Leon deserved something so much more than that slip of a tart. And her new husband, I wouldn't lay money on how long that marriage will last. They finally left before I could punch that husband in the nose, but it was afterwards that became heavenly.<br/><br/>Leon wasn't perturbed or angry with me. Instead he asked me out for a picnic on the beach! How could I say no, after how he looked standing there smiling down at me. Something quivered within me at that smile, and before I knew it I was riding along with him on his motorcyle. I think I would have preferred to ride behind him, and have my arms around that taunt waist, but I enjoyed the sidecar.<br/><br/>We chatted while we sat on the beach. My heart beat quickly in my chest when he said I wasn't pretty, but rather that I was beautiful. I don't think of myself that way, but this man sitting beside me did.And he said he would find more ways to compliment me too! He is so sweet!<br/><br/>I suggested we go swimming before eating, to build up our appetites. And I raced to the water, and turned to watch him following behind me. He is so beautiful- chiseled form, tall, and ruggedly handsome. I wanted to feel his muscles beneath my hands, and I managed to swim close enough to do that. I should have faked not being able to swim so he could have carried me up to the beach in those strong arms of his. As it was, I think we both found each other physically appealing. <br/><br/>The wine, the chicken, right down to the fresh baked apple pie was so perfect. And I found myself lost in those dreamy eyes of his several times. Once I thought I made him blush, which is so cute!<br/><br/>Like all things, the evening had to end eventually, but I felt like I had been in a dream while I was with him. I love everything about him from that deep melodious voice that send shivers throughout me to his sweetness and caring. A part of me wants to be with him always, and another part tells me to run...I think I want to stay. Leon is worth fighting for.

Fynnariel threw herself down onto a patch of grass. Wings was making chittering, clicking and chirping noises, that sounded an awful lot like scolding, but she wasn’t listening. Instead she had a big stupid grin plastered across her face and an uncharacteristic dreamy look in her eye. <br/><br/>Ink, quill and her journal in hand, she sat down to write:<br/><br/><em>What. Am. I. Doing? What am I doing? <br/><br/>I met with Carinoth, quite by chance. There were two others with him, Eliza Duskwhither and Rhannah’s brother Leon. Eliza called herself a battle mage and is new to the Fellowship. She seemed…interesting. Leon is part of a circus, he seemed reserved. I’m not sure I can take his word on the treatment of their circus animals. That is something I shall have to see for myself. I’ve never been to a circus performance before. Leon offered to get Carinoth and I tickets.<br/><br/>Myself and Carinoth…at the circus? Can you imagine? I can’t. But my heart seems to race a bit faster thinking about it. <br/><br/>Is that normal?! Or maybe I’m ill?! <br/><br/>I can still feel his touch on my hand, it was…pleasant. His arm around me felt constricting at first, but actually kind of nice. My cheek is still tingling from when he kissed me goodbye. <br/><br/>Strange, I was reluctant to leave his side tonight. That man, he has something…I cannot…quite put my finger on it…something about him that I enjoy being around. <br/><br/>All of this awkward tension in me should make we want to kill something, but instead I think…I think, I am enjoying it.<br/><br/>Other people seem to be so much better at this, like Zyss and Rhannah. This is all so new and confusing! I mean, I’ve been with men. But that was nearly always with alcohol involved. With dull senses, and it wasn’t as slow paced by any means. <br/><br/>I do like this…this is a good speed, slow with heightened senses. Perhaps I will get used to it eventually? We really do need to work on that hugging thing…<br/><br/>Look at what I’m writing! I sat fireside with three people, two of them new and I can only think of one. Oh how I wish I was still oblivious to matters of the heart…Next thing you know I’ll be drawing hearts…No.No.No. Not happening! </em><br/><br/>Wings squawked loudly and Fyn jumped, spilling ink over most of the page. <br/><br/>“That was uncalled for.” Fyn scolded the Dragonhawk. “Wings, you should’ve been nicer. Unlike you, Nethers was being kind.” She cleaned up her page, doing more damage than good and getting more ink, and now grass, everywhere.<br/><br/>Wings purred softly and caught Fyn’s eyes with his own. Holding her in his gaze. “I’m sorry, Wings.” She stroked him and he cooed gently at her touch. “I know you’re just looking out for me…but this…whatever it is. This is my path to walk, no matter where it may lead.”<br/><br/> “Try to be nicer to Carinoth for me…please?” Nuzzling into her side Wings purred once more in response. “Thank you.”<br/><br/>“Fel!” Cursing, Fyn threw her quill across the grass. “I forgot the copper…again!” She turned a shade of pink and whispered. “This being ‘more’ is certainly distracting!”

Rhannah walked back from her mailbox, going through all the letters she had received. "Bill, bill, advertising, money, another bill.." She stopped as she saw a plain envelope with her brother's familiar style of writing addressed to her. "I wonder what big brother has to say for himself."<br/><br/>She poured herself a cup of tea and sat down to read the letter.<br/><br/><em>Little Sis.<br/><br/>I guess all the times I tried to help you get over Micah, I should have been listening to myself. Not a day went by when I didn't think of Narella and try to work out what went so horribly wrong. I know you often told me that you worried about me ever being able to move on and get on with my life.<br/><br/>Well you can relax now. Narella has been consigned to the distant past where she belongs. I can almost seeing you do that happy dance you did when Mum got you a kitten for Winter's Veil when you were ten. Go on, I don't mind. I've been doing my own happy dance.<br/><br/>I ran into Narella at Fairbreeze Village the other day. She introduced me to her new husband. The strange thing was, I wasn't devastated. I should have been considering how long I carried a torch for her. But I wasn't. I mean, it did hurt, seeing her with someone else's ring on her finger. Just not as much as I thought it would have. <br/><br/>While I was talking with them, Jen came up and joined us. I can tell you this, she took one look at Narella and hated her on the spot! I thought I was going to have to hold Jen back, the way she was snarling at Narella!<br/><br/>I was going to have a picnic on the beach behind Duskwither Spire and had called at Fairbreeze to collect the picnic basket I had ordered when I ran into Narella. After she and her husband had left, I don't know how or why, but I found myself asking Jen to join me. We talked long into the evening and I didn't think of Narella once the whole time!<br/><br/>I swear I must have had a big goofy grin all over my face when I returned to the circus because Jorel made a comment about me getting lucky. I could have punched him out for even thinking like that. I probably would have if there weren't other people in the tent at the time. It would serve him right for thinking I would do that sort of thing on the first date. <br/><br/>I don't know if this feeling will last, or even if she feels the same way. I hope she does, and I think she does. All I know is that my heart feels lighter when I am around her and I wake each morning with a smile on my face and thinking of her. Pathetic I know, but I can't help it, and I'm sure I would if I could stop it. I feel younger and more alive than I have in years.<br/><br/>Give Mittens a scratch behind the ears for me and prepare my room. I'm planning to visit you later in the week.<br/><br/>Love always, your big brother,<br/><br/>Leon.</em><br/><br/>Rhannah placed her empty cup on the table and smiled to herself before bursting into her happy dance. <em>It's about time big brother.</em>

<em>From the pages of my journal:</em><br/><br/>What does one do when something they loved has become bland and tasteless. I had thought I would never truly become bored, and yet I fidget and worry and find I cannot focus. I have tried to rationalize it and the only thing I can come up with is that I fell out of love.<br/><br/>Fishing just doesn't have the excitement, that zing it had before. I find myself daydreaming as I have tried to fish in old familiar waters. Dreaming of my family, of holding my son and daughter in my arms, of watching my wife expand as the twins grow within her. <br/><br/>And most of all, finding my heart loves Kel'tira more and more each day. I worry for her, and about her. Winterspring showed me how protective I am of her and how quickly I am to retaliate. A part of me knows Kel'tira knows her limitations. Light, I hope she knows her limitations. <br/><br/>And yet I know I cannot harness or prevent her from doing what she loves for the Fellowship. Even though she may not be the guildmistress any longer, she still cares for all of them, every one of them. And only wants the best for them, and wants the Fellowship to be able to stand on it's own. New Dawn is a step in the right direction.<br/><br/>I have been there on a few occassions, just checking on its progress and helping where I can. I have noticed small plots of ground set up as gardens. And homes being cared for. And while there is much to be done, I sense a certain pride in the workers and people of what has been accomplished in New Dawn. <br/><br/>What am I to do for the next several months, since fishing holds no enjoyment for me anymore? I believe, I will explore more of Pandaria. I am not even close to seeing all this wonderous land holds for me. And I find the more I learn of the rich history and culture, the more I wish to defend her and protect her. I have not seen Kiki lately, perhaps a visit is in order.

<em>The height should have been dizzying, but for a leaf, it meant nothing. The water roared loudly as it crashed down the mountain, carrying with it the hapless leaf in a rush to plunge over the edge and fall a hundred feet to the bottom. The point of impact so far below was a white frothy brew that churned under the onslaught of water. For a moment, the leaf was out of sight, gone under the waves but the current pushed it up into the pool that formed between two waterfalls. The leaf surfaced again, rising slowly to ride atop the water, drifting gently as the current slowed, unhurried and unhurt by the harrowing ride off the mountains of Kun Lai down to the lush green of the Jade Forest.<br/><br/>It floated by a woman who did not notice it. Her once brown hair was now a lighter honey color. Her gaze was fixed on a lone crane fishing in the shallow pools. The woman was sitting on a rock, wearing only an oversized blue shirt. Her hair was damp from swimming and her legs were crossed under her. In her lap rested a journal. Not far, a small dragonhawk drifted along, poking through the tall grass curiously before spying a small fish in the water and snapping it up.<br/><br/>***<br/>(New entry in a dark brown journal)</em><br/><br/>I have returned to Pandaria as I promised myself and while I have yet to make it back to Kun Lai, my heart feels lighter already. Perhaps I will my time in reaching Binen Village. I am still numb, part of me refuses to believe that he is gone, that I won’t ever hear his voice again, but I feel as if I can breathe again. It is still hard, and I know that it will be hard for a while yet.<br/>I met a ranger in Eversong not too many days after I returned to Silvermoon to put Sol’s final affairs in order. His perspective was refreshing; he was someone who did not have any ties to me or Sol, had no idea what had happened and having someone to speak to that was so distant from everything was something that I sorely needed. He offered me a pet, a young dragonhawk, to keep me company. I have not named her as of yet, I am waiting to see what name seems to fit her best.<br/><br/>My life is slowly coming back in order, one step at a time. Which was Luc’s advice… one step at a time, one day at a time. I need to make plans, come up with something that has no ties to my late husband and move forward with something that is for me. When I first spoke with Luc, I didn’t want to move forward, I didn’t want to have a new life, but now I know that if I don’t move forward, then I will drown in what little past I have. I have to define myself, not be defined by an event.<br/><br/>I will either find a way or make one—I once said those words when leaving a hospital without any idea of who I was or where I would go. I made a way once, I will do so again.<br/><br/>But I am finding it is so hard to let go.

We met again. The first time, I never thought I would see him again. He was so weak, so pale. Trembling, his skin ashen and feverish whispers escaping him. He mistook me for someone. A name. I don't remember her name. Just that he kept whispering to me. Pleading for forgiveness. But he did not see me, and I am not that name. <br/><br/>Ratheron ordered for me to help with the cleansing. I would find it. I would rip it from his very being. This human, this man. His screams. I can still remember them. Knowing who he is, now. I cannot look back on that and not be shaken. He was not a weak person. My inexperience caused him great discomfort as I removed the fragment of a Sha from his very being. Severed its connection to his body, then purged him. He nearly collapsed, and Ratheron moved forward to protect me. Without two of us, it would have been impossible.<br/><br/>That one fragment hadn't been within the man long enough to kill him, but long enough to drain him. To manifest into something more. It probably had only been a whisper before it had come into contact with this man. That was all that it needed. Sentient life. Then it become something horrible. A nightmare. <br/><br/>I believe he passed out as I began healing his wounds. Someone or something had hurt him. But, examining him, it was that piece of Sha corruption which had done the most damage. Leaving him ill, weak, vulnerable. Had they not brought him in as quickly as they did, he would have been lost. <br/><br/>It transformed into me. And I had to watch as Ratheron attacked it. Attacked me. That is what a monk is. That is what we can do. Focus. Logic. Reason. He protected me, and I rose once I knew the warrior was safe. And we killed it. Not an easy task. But we couldn't have done it. Not alone. <br/><br/>I fear the Sha, I respect them greatly for what they are. Monsters. Never ending monsters. Parasites. Nasty, horrible things. But I approach them with the ration and reason needed. Or they would turn my own fears against me. I have to. We've all learned to do it, those of us who have spent so much time in Pandaria. So, why then? Why am I crying?<br/><br/>Why can't they understand that this isn't a game? All that's been learned has been learned. Why can't they trust us? This darkness, it can never be harnessed. <br/><br/>I have been home less than twenty-four hours... maybe I should have never come back...<br/><br/>Now everyone is mad and even thinking about the party we've worked so hard to prepare for everyone just seems like...<br/><br/>... a waste...<br/><br/>How can we think of celebrating when everyone's mad at Ratheron? At me? <br/><br/>I can't sleep. I need to take another walk.

It's been a crazy week, but I'm not sure I would have it any other way.<br/><br/>I ran into Carinoth the other day. It's so sweet how the mere mention of Fyn's name causes him to blush! They seem to be really hitting it off and the blush indicates that they may actually be more than just friends. I hope so! They make such a cute couple. You know, I swear I saw Carinoth actually crack a smile one time when Fyn was around. She seems to be good for him and It looks like he's good for her as well. <br/><br/>I'm glad I suggested he talk to her. I hated having to crush his hopes like I did, but I had to. I couldn't let him think he had a chance with me when the reality was that he had none at all.<br/><br/>A couple of days ago Shadow and Rath came back from wherever they were, Pandaria I think. Where they actually were isn't important. It was so good to see Shadow again. She's one of those people who are naturally bubbly and a lot of fun to be around. Leon would say that she is good for me. Maybe she is. I don't know. I know I do laugh and giggle a lot when she's around. She seems to have this knack of bringing out the girly part of me that normally gets hidden away. <br/><br/>Then again, she seems to do that with most people. Even Lineron and Daenith seem less serious when she's around. I have to admit though, I still have mixed feelings about this party she's planning. I normally don't go to parties if I can avoid it. Damned shyness! Even Rian's first reaction was an instant No when she told us about it.<br/><br/>Last night, for some reason, I couldn't sleep and took a walk out of the city to Stillwhisper Pond. I ran into Shadow and Carinoth. She was teasing him in her usual playful way and accidentally knocked him into the pond! After he managed to drag himself out of the pond, we all sat and talked for a while before Carinoth went back into the city. <br/><br/>I stayed and talked with Shadow for a while. She was still bubbly, but I saw shadows in her eyes. Some of the things she saw while in Pandaria seem to still haunt her. There's a seriousness to her nature that comes out on occasion now. Maybe that's a good thing, maybe it's not, time will tell.<br/><br/>We must have talked for an hour or so when we were joined by Ratheron. The love between those two is so touching. I hope that one day people will be able to say that about Rian and I. Right now, we're still getting to know each other so it's hard to say if it will last. I hope it does. I talked for a long time with Shadow and Ratheron. He doesn't seem to be as stern as he likes to make out, or is it just that Shadow has worked her magic on him as well? That she lightens him up while he calms her down? <br/><br/>Whatever it is, the two of them combined make a powerful force, and I found myself agreeing to go to the party. Now how do I convince Rian to go as well ...

Serenity Peak was beautiful. The snow, the clean air, the wildlife and the monks all gave Rian a huge measure of peace. Meditation was meant to be an exercise in mind control and decision making. For contemplating his life's goals and his path. <br/><br/>He knew that Rhannah had selected her path, and in her own way. She went against the traditions of power for powers sake. At least that was how he perceived it. But where did he fit into her life? What was his path? Were Ratheron and Shadow so set in how they interacted and was it the only way to be a monk?<br/><br/>There was so much he did not know yet. He fished in the cold mountain streams, releasing most of the fish to allow the balance of Nature to continue. He sat for hours in the silence of meditation. Those around him were content to let him be, When dusk fell and the night grew cold he still sat on the bank of the stream, lost in thought. Cooking the few fish he kept, and drinking the cold mountain water was enough for him to continue meditating.<br/><br/>Whatever his decision would be, he would approach the others when his mind was made. He did not want to hurt Rhannah, and it made for some serious soul searching.<br/><br/>He did not let the thought of any of the others who might worry about him color his mind. It was his decision to make and he had to do it. No one else would walk in his steps, it was his path.

<em>From the pages of my journal:</em><br/><br/>I am home. I have spent the past few hours cleaning, scrubbing, and airing out this fine place the Fellowship was gracious enough to give to Kel'tira. And I even laundered the linens. I am becoming quite the house husband. I have dinner on a very slow broil, and I will try to contact my beloved. <br/><br/>We need to sit down and talk. Talk about our future, and talk about the present. We need to get back in touch with one another. Just to keep open those precious lines of communication. And it's not a "his fault/ her fault" kind of thing, it never really has been anything like that between us. <br/><br/>I have broken a contract. Something I have never done in my life, and yet I break it now for I feel that I am losing sight of the most important person I have ever known, my wife. I know we each go our seperate ways doing those things we both must do, but I feel her slipping away. When we are together, and have an evening, we quell the passion and hunger we have for one another, and then we go our seperate ways again the next morning.<br/><br/>What to do...what to do...

<em>The dawn was breaking over Silvermoon, and she found herself sitting on a hill giggling and laughing with a new friend Shadow, and a good friend Rhannah. At least, she thought of her as a good friend. </em><br/><br/>Entry 8 - Silvermoon City<br/><br/>I finally got to talk to Rhannah. She was hurt and angry when I first talked to her. And I understand why. Seems Rian and her have talked and they are getting along splendidly now. I am so happy for them.<br/><br/>I like this new person I met, this Shadow. She seems to really have her act together, and she knows Ratheron! If he's anything like her, I look forward to meeting him.<br/><br/>Rhannah and I talked about Leon a little bit. And I happened to say he looked "dreamy", which Rhannah was going to tell Leon. I had her promise not too, but to tell me what he had said about me in his letter. Only if she could tell Leon he was dreamy. We came to a stalemate, until Shadow mentioned she had made no such promise and looked forward to meeting this "dreamy" paladin for herself. And I realized how foolish I sounded.<br/><br/>So, I told Rhannah she could tell Leon. She mentioned a few things that I will hold dear from that delightful gentleman. I can only imagine what he will think when she tells him I think he's dreamy.

<em>It is a warm day in Silvermoon City, nary a breeze to tickle the branches or play with the leaves fallen and laying about.

She walks over and sits down, opening the diary and dips the pen in the ink to begin to write:</em><br/><br/>I have not seen my love for a few days now. And I feel an ache growing within me. An ache to hold him once again and to see him, and to talk to him. However, I know he is busy in his training and I must wait. So I prepare to go questing in the Plaguelands.<br/><br/>I will find things to keep my mind and heart occupied, letting my knight grow in strength. It is my desire to one day work beside him. So I will never have to leave him again, but be with him always.<br/><br/>Also, I seek a goal, to see this New Dawn area of the Fellowship. To find a place where possibly my knight and I may find rest and comfort when necessary. I can hope that one day we may build a home and a life together there. <br/><br/><em>She gently blows across the wet ink aiding it in drying and then stoppers the ink bottle. Then she gently packs them all into the backpack. She slings the pack over her shoulders, and moves to leave the little home she had created here. She stops, looks around the room, memories come to mind, and then she blows out the candle, casting the room in darkness as she closes the door.</em>

<em>The Plaguelands this day we're as they always were. Dark, brown, and infested with an assortment of undead creatures ready and willing to kill you at an moment. Along with a fifty percent chance that a cloud of plague fog will come your way and make you into said undead creatures. But in the remnants of the Scarlet Enclave (now for some reason called New Dawn), the Death Knight Lineron Plagueweaver was setting up the training ground for the Rising Sun Fellowship, so the brats- I mean younger initiates could have some place to train and become less of a waste of space and time. <br/><br/>While the ghouls were setting up the training dummies, obstacle course, traps that Lineron is putting in and Ratheron totally doesn't know about BECAUSE HE IS A WIMP-*cough* *coughs up phlegm* I'm dead! How can I even get a damn cold?! Eh....where was I? Screw it, point is Lineron is writing in a journal that he recently 'acquired' from a unfortunet member of whats left of the Cult of the Damned. The journal's cover is adorned with a screaming skull with what appears to be blood coming from its eyes and unholy runes surrounding it. Skulls are kind of his thing so, why not?</em><br/><br/>So, I found this journal off some poor excuse of a Necromancer who thought that the Lich King was still alive. The face he made when I told him he died....priceless! Anyway, I thought that since Carinoth has a super secret journal where he keeps all of his angsty poems or something written in it, I thought 'what the fel?' So here you are journal! Well, I had to get rid of some...in a word 'screwed' up drawings and writings this Necromancer had in you. Including for some reason a letter stating how sorry he was and that he begged forgiveness and to give the letter to his lost love. Still debating whether I should or not.....<br/><br/>Anyway, the training ground is nearly done. Along with some...'improvements' that Ratheron doesn't know about. Nothing that can kill or harm anyone heavily of course! Just a few jump scares here and there, a few curses to make people speak in tongues for a short amount of time, some ghosts that will chase the brats around the obstacle course. The usual in my opinion. Hehe....I probably added these 'additions' to spite Rathy now that I think about it. Its not that I don't think Ratheron is a fool, I mean he has obviously seen the Sha and seen what they can do. But that is why the weapon would be useful for us! Yes, it is Sha-touched, but it is also powerful. We can use it against the damn Sha, use there own power against them! But, I still believe it was the right thing to tell him. No secrets between any of us....though in hindsight, I suppose it would have been a good thing to keep quiet about it for a little bit longer. Now he has ordered Carinoth to destroy both the weapon and all the research he has done on the Sha, that is where the line was crossed.<br/><br/>Why can't Ratheron see? The ends justify the means. This weapon can help a lot of people when held in the right hands. If there is a risk of me getting possessed by some damn Sha, then I am willing to risk it. And if Rath really thinks we will destroy the weapon then he is the fool.<br/><br/>Carinoth also told me of what Shadow told him....about this 'Tai', apparently one of my brothers....he also wields a Sha-touched weapon. And doesn't appear to be possessed by anything of note....I hope to meet him soon. This weapon could save a lot of good people....but, the path to damnation is lined with good intentions. Well now that I think about it I am already kind of damned...hmm....I have to think about that. Whatever, anyway I hope either Ratheron can come to his senses or we can show him that we can be trusted with this.

The arrow hit its mark and a Dark Iron Dwarf fell dead. Fynnariel exited the Cauldron as swiftly and silently as she and Varah could manage. She was careful to leave no trace of them behind, though it was a difficult task in the Searing Gorge. Hunter and pet climbed high into the cliffs until Fyn found a sheltered over hang where they could rest with out fear of being found by Dark Iron Slavers.<br/><br/>Fyn was shaking from head to toe. Her breath was haggard and she struggled to regain composure. The fear that drove this reaction did not come from the various beasts and Elementals, or the Dark Irons that plagued the area. <br/><br/>Head between her knees, she took deep breathes. <em>In and out, counting slowly, one, two, three…</em>Fyn’s knuckles were white, tears slid down her soot stained cheeks. <br/><br/>She did not like enclosed spaces. Not for prolonged periods of time and her exploration of the excavation site, of the caves that wound through it, aggravated her fear. It was a wonder Fynnariel and Varah made it out alive. Tightening of the chest, the shortness of breath, the irrational and almost immediate horror of being trapped in a place she couldn’t escape. Fyn hadn’t felt anything like that in a very long time and the effort it took to focus was immense. <br/><br/>Perhaps she needed a break from the Gorge…

Serenity Peak it was named. And Rian was there, next to the stream. It had become a favorite spot. He sat still as a statue and thought of his day. He had reached a decision and talked to Rhannah. He had been relieved to hear her words. She believed in him, it felt good. For the first time in many years someone cared about him. He was not sure how to deal with it.<br/><br/>He knew he wanted to be with her. Take care of her, protect her, stand by her no matter what anyone else thought. He had not dared to whisper more of his thoughts to her. He wanted simply to get to know her better. If it was meant to be it would bloom as it should. <br/><br/>He thought of other things as well. Ratheron reminded him of his father. A mixture of helplessness and a strong urge to run away warred in him. He felt he could not satisfy Ratheron, no matter how hard he tried. He struggled to understand. Why was his every thought challenged? Even when he stood up to back him up the man turned on him and told him to remain silent.<br/><br/>What did he want? Rian wanted to gain his respect, but had no clue how to do that. If he spoke up it was wrong, if he said nothing it was wrong. The nightmare of his early years surfaced and Rian felt the hot tears coursing down his cheeks. He was alone and no one saw him, but the wind came to dry his tears. His father yelling at him constantly. His brother beating him until he was covered in bruises.<br/><br/>He thought his tears were all dried up long ago. He had learned to fight back, but it had taken him years to get strong enough to hold his own against his brother. His father had died with the Scourge invasion, having sent him and his brother to safety. His mother had died at his birth, he never knew her.<br/><br/>His meeting of a Pandaren had sent him to learn the ways of the monk. He still lost fights, but was told it did not matter, sometimes you had to lose to win. That one he was still trying to figure out. It had taken him months to learn to channel his Chi. It still surprised him he had the ability to heal himself and others.<br/><br/>In spite of his early upbringing he had compassion and the will to survive. He hoped it was enough. Something told him he would learn a lot from Ratheron. He resolved to be patient and meditate the full three days.

<em>The sun was rising warm and golden in the sky, its long beams of light chasing away the night and touching into dark pools of shadow, eliminating them. Cyaer heard the gentle sound of the surf below, and the morning cries of the gulls in search of their breakfast.<br/><br/>He felt more than saw his wife wrapped around him, clinging to his strong body, seeking warmth and comfort. His arm was about her, and he realized that this is where he wanted to be every morning. Here, within the confines and sanctuary of their home in the Wilds.<br/><br/>His hand reached across his chest to gently stroke Kel'tira's hair, as the other held her close to him. Cy could feel the warm of her breath on his chest as she slept. And for the first time in a long time the rogue was content and happy. There would be more of these mornings, and he was already looking forward to them<br/><br/>He kissed the top of Kel's head, and sighed heavily. They had talked, and were beginning to open those lines of sharing and caring again. It would not happen overnight, but it was a beginning.

It had been their strength, and it would be again.<br/><br/>Cy wasn't foolish enough to think he could hold back what was happening to Pandaria and the rest of Azeroth. But he thought, maybe, just maybe he could create a small refuge for his family here in the Wilds. Light he hoped so.<br/><br/>Kel stirred on his chest awakening, "Cy?"<br/><br/>His voice was soft and quiet, "Yes, my love."<br/><br/>"Is it time to get up?" Her voice was sleepy.<br/><br/>"No, beloved, we have hours before we must be up. Go back to sleep now." His voice was gentle and low.<br/><br/>A mumbled okay was heard as she turned and snuggled close to him on her side. Cy moved to lay on his side, his arm around her. He began to sing a sweet sindorei lullabye to his beautiful wife, allowing her a few more hours of rest.<br/><br/>Light he hoped so...</em>
