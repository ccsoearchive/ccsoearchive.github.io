The past few days I have spent training hard. I havn't been out to the field of battle in a long time, and, as I am shipping out to Pandaria in... eleven days now, I figured I might as well be prepared. I'm going to look for Zyss and hopefully be able to be with her one more time before I go.<br/><br/> <em>Kreindis stops to smile lightly as he writes, remembering what she had said only a few days ago. "You get one now, one the next time we meet, and one especially for goodbye." </em><br/><br/>I think I'll call over the guildstone in abit for her. For now I need to eat, and get a little bit of rest. Training has tired me out. <br/><br/>Note to Self - Visit the blacksmith to repair armor.

<em> From the Journal of Zakia Sunblade</em><br/><br/><strong> Thursday Morning</strong><br/><br/>Once again I write with a conflicted heart, nay not because of this other me taking over again, but what it has caused to happen. The past two days, members of the Fellowship have met for conversation, and good company, but alas, I still find myself apart from them. It is not that I do not want to be with them, but simply the fear that my other self has caused irreparable damage to my relationship with them. I find myself afraid of their looks, I see suspicion in their eyes, and judgement, it could all just be in my head, but I find that I cannot shake the thoughts away.<br/><br/>What does one do when they are so afraid of themselves around other people, for this is where my confliction resides. What if the other me rears it's ugly head, and causes harm to a member of the Fellowship, how could I live with myself, if I were to unknowingly hurt Fynnariel, the one person who has tried to help me, that isn't a family member. How could I live with myself if I were t ohurt Rhan, or Medra, or even Leon, the overbearing dastard that he is I still love him. More and more I feel this fire take hold, when I am on my missions, and I find more, and more I watch from the sidelines as my body slaughters all in it's path, and it terrifies me.<br/><br/>So I find myself sitting apart from the others, keeping my distance, both physically and emotionally, even last night I ignored Medra, when it should have been a happy time, of brother and sister bonding with their new companions. Of course she has always been better than me in social situations, I remember when we were little, and were playing with our friends, I was always just the silent guardian of my little sister, protecting her from whatever danger may arise. Now however, she is no longer the little girl I need to protect, she has grown into a fine, strong young woman, and doesn't need me anymore, but I fear I need her, Rhan, and Leon now more than they need me.<br/><br/>I am afraid of myself, of this other me, and because of it I am alienating myself from everyone, even my own family, even now my frustration at the situation has caused me undue trauma. As I prepared myself for bed last night, looking in the mirror I did not see myself, I saw a hideous manufacture, it looked like me, but in the reflections eyes, and smile I saw nothing but cruelty, and the desire to fight, and to kill. The vision was too much, and I smashed the mirror inflicting a long gash that runs halfway up my arm, I tried to bandage it, but I have never been good with such delicate work. Blood covers both my bedding, and this Journal, and I cannot go to Rhan, or Medra they would just worry, and I could not bear to see those looks on their faces.<br/><br/>(1/2)

Not when I myself grow concerned, I have not seen Rhan, or Leon for the past few days, Medra did not say anything last night, so perhaps my worry is unneccessary. Still I need them both right now, but even if they were here, could I tell them what is going on, and even if I did could they do anything to help me. Perhaps this problem is best kept to myself, but a few more incidents like the one last night, then I won't be able to hide the scars of my own personal struggle. What am I to do, who can I turn to, who can save me from this waking nightmare.<br/><br/>(2/2)

I spent most of my day with Zyss yesterday. I called out for her ofer the guild stone, and she answered. I asked her if she would meet me at the beach by Duskwither Spire, and she said yes. I waited for a few minutes for her to come, and when she came into my view she cried my name. She ran to me, and we hugged each other. <br/><br/>We talked for a while on the shore, about how we loved each other. We kissed once or twice, too. We went into the warm water of the ocean soon after. In the water she was playing with me a bit. She pulled on my toes, and splashed my face. At another point, she hid in the seaweed, and then when I was looking for her, she grabbed me by my shirt and kissed me deeply. <br/><br/>When we went back to shore, I kissed her deeply too, putting all my love into the kiss. I wanted her to know I love her, and I think it worked. Her knees went weak at first, but she held to me to stay up. She asked me to do it again, and I did. This time she leaned into it, and kissed back. She moaned a little bit too. <br/><br/>We went out to dinner after we changed into clean clothes, and while I was getting us food, she came up behind me and kissed my neck. I think I felt her hand drift down a bit lower from my back, too.. I'm not sure though. I got her anything she asked for. We had some wine, fruit, and fish to eat. She whispered to me after I said cantelope was my favorite fruit because it was so sweet, and she whispered to me and said 'just like your lips.' <br/><br/>I whispered back that her lips are my favorite food, and that I can never get enough. She blushed and smiled at me. She held and squeezed my hand, but she had to leave, sadly.. I enjoyed spending so much time with her, though. I have to remember to give her more of those deep kisses that she likes now..

Late afternoon, the next day, deep into the Eastern Plaguelands<br/><br/>Oh, dear journal what an exquisite day I had with my sweet paladin yesterday. I find the time I have to spend with him to be special and I can only dream what a full week or a lifetime would be like in his arms. I know, only wishful thinking...<br/><br/>However, he said the word that sent my heartbeat racing, and tore open old memories.<br/><br/>Forever.<br/><br/><em>Men will say anything to lay with you, and have their way with you. And I fell for one such line of false love and only lust. I felt dirty and used, and I promised myself I would not fall for such a thing again.</em><br/><br/>And yet, I see it in his eyes, this is no line for him, his heart backs up his words, and I found myself crying yet again while he held me close to him. His gentle fingers wiping the tears away, and the memory too with a gentle kiss.<br/><br/>I give myself to him, trusting in his love for me, and in those long lingering kisses of love. I have never felt the way I do when he kisses me like that. A part of me melts inside, and I literally felt weak in the knees. And he did it again. And I returned in kind. <br/><br/>The soft gentle kisses, the tender warm kisses are so good, but they pale to these true testimonial kisses that mean so much to me. Krei is and always will be the man I want and desire...<br/><br/>...Forever.

The huntress was lying wrapped up in Carinoth’s arms. She snuggled closer into the warmth of his body, but did not wake. Fynnariel stirred in her sleep once or twice. She was dreaming…a pleasant yet sad dream of what once was… <br/><br/><em>Sounds of laughter echoed through a dark clearing surrounded by trees. In the center of this clearing, a roaring fire blazed and three people smiled and joked beside it. The sounds of animals could be heard nearby, dragonhawks perhaps? The wind picked up and sparks drifted upwards into a starry sky. <br/><br/>“Fynnariel! You really must join us in Silvermoon!” Bainor, laughed and his whole body shook with the sound of it. “Haradion gets into all sorts of trouble.”<br/><br/>Haradion, sitting on the other side of Bainor snorted with derision. His silver hair glinting in the firelight as he shook his head. “Say’s the elf who is now on girlfriend number…?” He looked over at Fynnariel. “You know I think I may have lost count.”<br/><br/>The huntress held up fingers like she was counting, her face screwed up in concentration. “I think she’s number 10.”<br/><br/>“And that’s only the 10 we know of.” Haradion winked at Fynnariel who nodded in agreement. “I was fond of number 8; she had a quality about her…” He simulated having large breasts and Fyn started giggling.<br/><br/>“I liked number 2.” Fyn looked absolutely serious. “She had a nice singing voice.”<br/><br/>“Ah yes! Number two…that’s not all she had that was nice.” Haradion dodged a playful backhand that Bainor had aimed at him.<br/><br/>“Ha ha. You two are hilarious.” Bainor stood up and threw another log into the fire. “They have names you know.” <br/> <br/>“Oh, and you remember them all?” Fyn teased.<br/><br/>Bainor leaned over Fyn in a mock threatening manner. “Enough about me and my dalliances. Let’s talk about yours.” Fyn scoffed at him and glowered, their conversations all seemed to end this way. “Perhaps the reason you don’t wish to join is you avoiding a certain city guard?”<br/><br/>Haradion leaned into Bainor a wicked gleam in his eye. “He keeps asking the Captain about you…what was his name again?”<br/><br/>“El-something…or Ab-something…” Bainor grinned wickedly. “We met him in the tavern didn’t we?” Bainor gave Fyn a crude once over. “My dear sister ranger, you must have left quite the impression for that guard to still be pining over you.” The two men burst into laughter.<br/><br/>Fyn gave him an icy glare and launched herself at the two men, the three wrestled in a flurry of fists, kicks and flailing limbs.<br/><br/>Out of the darkness a quiet voice mocked. “And these are the Rangers of the renowned Farstriders.” The three rangers paused mid fight, staring up at the unimpressed face of their Captain.<br/><br/>“C-captain!” They stuttered in unison, and with unusual grace disentangled themselves from each other with a salute. <br/><br/>Captain Dîr Fadeleaf stared at them with a stoic expression. He then pointed to the person standing beside him. All three heads swivelled to see who else was present. “Meet our new Ranger.” He looked at the golden blond man standing next to him. “Dagor Oron.”<br/><br/>“Well met-“ Dagor began.<br/><br/>“Ered!” Bainor shouted suddenly pointing at Fyn. “That was his name.” Haradrion put his face in his hand, shaking his head slowly. Fynnariel’s face just burned. <br/><br/>Dîr looked at Fynnariel and raised an eyebrow, he was clearly amused. “That city guard you took home last month? Yes please do something about him; we can’t have one of our rangers being stalked.” This was met with laughter, jeers, and bickering from Bainor, Haradion and Fynnariel. <br/><br/>The Captain took a seat around the fire. “Duty calls…tomorrow we protect some nobleman’s homestead.” <br/><br/>“That’s our mission?” Dagor asked quietly, clearly he expected something more adventurous.<br/><br/>“Dargin.” Bainor grinned. <br/><br/>“Dagor.” <br/><br/>“That’s what I said.” Bainor blinked once before continuing. “We’re going Troll hunting.”<br/><br/>“Trolls?”<br/><br/>“Put your man pants on rookie…you’re about to find out what it takes to be a member of the Farstriders.” Bainor laughed a hearty laugh, then after a moment asks. “Have you ever been to Silvermoon Dag?” <br/><br/>Fynnariel tossed another log into the flames. Sparks shot into the air, floating gently up into the sky. The group laughed and chatted long into the evening… </em><br/><br/>These memories had been pushing their way to the surface ever since she met the Fellowship. Ever since Fyn let others back into her heart…

The shadowless does not speak empty words about me. I do not shy away from my nature, what I once was. And it will never leave me. My mind was broken through, everything torn apart. And that is what I now do to others. How I reach into their inner sanctum and begin to destroy all sense of safety. The revolted feeling of being violated seeps in at first, I can feel it in the way they shiver. The way that they try to jerk away from me, as if that will do any good. The cold realization that anything they could do to fight me is for naught.<br/><br/>Some of them have abilities. But I have the endurance. The upper hand. I am the captor, the guard, the interrogator. And they are my prisoner. I have no problem with starving a man, denying him sleep. Then the defenses grow weaker. They do not like what I do to them when they sleep. The screams, I well remember.<br/><br/>I will not speak beyond that. But it is in my nature, now. To find weakness, to pry into it. Attack it like a ravenous shadow, feasting and growing, spreading like a disease. I would do this to any who stand against House Firehawk, even if no rumor could ever begin to guess what my calling used to be.<br/><br/>The whispers know me as the Matron of House Firehawk. Lord Tyrael's favorite. The wagging tongues speak about how he met me in Booty Bay and fell for me. A noble who made coin bargaining well with the Trade Princes. I made him chase me, I have him wrapped around my little finger. But he is still Lord Tyrael, a wh*re of a man. Much like his late father, Aserius, who had many a mistress on the side.<br/><br/>Some of them even speculate that Zari's child is Tyrael's. I couldn't laugh more at the rumors. Tyrael nearly killed Zari for teasing him, I could see it in his eyes. He would have none of it. And she backed away accordingly. She isn't scarred like I am, a woman with appeal, confidence, a magnet for trouble. <br/><br/>He would have loved her more than me if she had met him once before. But she is a horribly dominant personality, as is he. I can't imagine what they would have done to each other, how much they would have hurt each other. Those kinds of people need a partner who can be patient, and neither of them know much about patience when it comes down to it.<br/><br/>I will protect Tyrael, his family. His bastard son. I know well about my lover, I know that he is the type most likely to hurt me. But I also believe that he has learned from his mistakes. If he hurts me, he will never have another chance. The fact that I gave him one after he attacked me once before is a miracle in and of itself. Because I made a promise to do what I could to bring him back. To fight against the Sorcerer with him. Now I stay because I trust him. Not because I am obligated.<br/><br/>If this woman does not return his reply, his offer of aid for his own child, I will hunt her down. I will separate her from her family. I will destroy her, for she is by far the guiltier party. Taking away any chance he had to own up to his mistakes, to be a man. She ran away to her second pick and relied on him like the weakling that she is. I do see Tyrael in his son, I do know that if she tries to cling the boy to her bosom, she will create another monster without a prayer.<br/><br/>He needs to know his father. Not as a father, but as a mentor. Someone who will understand him. Tyrael would die if he was forced to see his son destroy himself as he once did. <br/><br/>I will not let this b*tch who could not keep her own legs closed, who could not be responsible and ran away become a burden. I will see that this boy gets what he needs to succeed in life. To be happy and productive, to be strong and free. <br/><br/>Firehawks do not do well when confined.

<em> From the Journal of Zakia Sunblade</em><br/><br/><strong> Saturday</strong><br/><br/>Tonight, I have begun reshaping my destiny, something that, until tonight, I thought was to be a dark, and violent one. Tonight I met with my sister, Rhannah, she had requested the meeting, for she had noticed the darkness dwelling within, and she had grown worried. I was hesitant at first, I thought of standing her up, but I knew that however much this other me scared me, the thought of what Rhannah would do to me if I didn't show scared me more. The conversation started out slow, I was trying, half heartedly, to keep the conversation away from where I knew she wanted it to go, and she trying to gently coax me into talking about it. I must admit the thought of what she would think of me, when I told her, the fear that she would disown me as her brother crossed my mind, but it was a foolish thought.<br/><br/>Rhannah is not without her own dark secrets, so why, when we as her siblings accepted her dark secrets, would I think she would not still love me, and accept me for mine. Finally the conversation got to the root of the problem, and I told her everything, of the other me, the incident involving the mirror, everything. I am not ashamed to admit the tears I shed tonight, even now, I fight back tears of joy, and happiness, for I truly possess the greatest big sister in all of Azeroth. As I spoke, she simply listened, with growing concern, and fear, not of me, but for me, she feared what this other me might force me to do to myself. I admit that was not the reaction I had expected, I had expected her to become afraid <strong> of</strong> me, but no she feared for my own well being.<br/><br/>We talked for hours it seemed, by the end we had both become determined to beat this dark prescence that dwells inside of me. She promised me she would search through her alchemy books, and consult those more knowledgeable than she, and she said she would make sure the people she told knew what would await them, if they spread the story throughout the Fellowship. She also gave me a couple of leads on people who may be able to help me, first she mentioned the Pandaren, a people who had long ago conquered their negative emotions. She mentioned one in particular, one Ji Firepaw, who dwells in Orgrimmar, I plan to visit him within the next few days, hopefully he can teach me something to keep this darkness suppressed, until I can travel to Pandaria to seek out a more knowledgeable Pandaren.<br/><br/>The second thing she mentioned was something, an old family friend had mentioned to her, she told her of a particular Night Elven druid, who goes through a similar situation as I do. He too has a dark prescence inside of him, but unlike me his is not of his own making, to imagine a mortal could suppress a demon possessing him, he must be incredibly powerful, perhaps as strong as an Arch Druid. Not only that he has been around for thousands of years with this demon, and has led, acoording to Rhannah, a relatively normal life, I am sure he could give me great knowledge on how to deal with this darkness.<br/><br/>Unfortunately as powerful as he is, he is constantly on the front lines, fighting against undead, demons, and other creatures of darkness. Tomorrow I plan to begin my search for this druid, this Sammuroth Stormfury, I will ask after his whereabouts to the druids of the Cenarion Circle, surely one of them will be able to give me a clue as to where to start. I just hope with all of this, that this darkness will be defeated soon, and I will keep my promise to Rhannah, to give her her brother back.

I have solved a mystery, only to find that another, greater than the one before it was revealed. <br/><br/>I had been worried for some time about Zak. He had grown quiet and withdrawn over the past few months. Not like his normal self. He had even stopped teasing Medra. <br/><br/>I was concerned enough to insist on him talking to me about it. I half expected him to not turn up, to tell me there was nothing wrong and mind my own business. To give him credit, he actually turned up. Even better, he told me what had been bothering him.<br/><br/>He told me how he had felt this 'other' personality that was dark, lived only for the kill and was arrogant and ruthless. I remembered seeing glimpses of the 'other' the night he met Ratheron. That was the first time that I became concerned. The arrogance that he displayed that night was unlike him. I should have said something then, but I had other problems on my mind and didn't. I hope you can forgive me little brother.<br/><br/>As he talked, I started to fear for Zak's life. Such a dark personality could turn on itself if there was no outlet for its even darker desires. It appeared it already had. A few days ago, I was with Jen when we ran into Zak. He was killing wolves and had a bandage on his arm. My first thought was that he had been bitten by one of the wolves. When he allowed me to see the wound, the truth was much different.<br/><br/>His story then was that he had tripped and put his arm through a mirror while trying to stop his fall. I didn't believe the story, but let the matter drop. Fortunately, Jen was able to cleanse the wound and heal it. Tonight Zak told me that I had been right not to believe his story, the wound had been inflicted intentionally, during a time when the other was in control of his actions.<br/><br/>I cannot imagine the hell he has been going through. Watching from a distance while your own body was forced to do and say horrible things. The whole time being powerless to stop it. I still shudder now as I think of it.<br/><br/>I know I should be afraid of what this other can do to me if it gains control while I am around. I can look after myself, but I still have a lot to learn about the dark arts that is my calling. I may not be able to fight this other and survive. I should be afraid, but I'm not. The fear of what it could do to me is minor compared to the fear of what it could do to my brother.<br/><br/>It is that fear which drives me to find a way to beat the darkness, to help Zak regain control of his negative emotions. I promised him that I would do everything I can to help him, and I will. I've already pulled my alchemy books off the shelves and am going through them, trying to find something that could help, even on a temporary basis.<br/><br/>In the morning, I plan to seek out my teachers and see if they have any knowledge that could help me in my search. I had thought of approaching Ratheron, to see if the mediation techniques he uses could help. But Ratheron is a tough master, and I'm not sure if he is the right person to ask. So instead, I suggested Zak talk to once of the pandaren in Orgrimmar, to see if he could teach Zak the meditation techniques.<br/><br/>I was reminded of something Bryah had told me, about a druid that had been possessed by a demon but had learned to control it. I told Zak what she had told me, and I think I actually saw hope in his eyes for the first time that night. With the two of us working to solve his problems, I'm confident we will come up with a solution. However, I fear that he may not be able to defeat this other by himself.<br/><br/>He may need the help of the Pandaren. Ones more skilled and knowledgeable than the ones in Orgrimmar. But that would mean a journey to Pandaria, and he is not yet ready for such a difficult journey.<br/><br/>This mystery with Zak, does have one peculiar benefit though. It has given my mind something to focus on. Something to take away the ache I feel without Rian by my side. I miss him so much it hurts. But he has made his choice and I must live with the consequences.

Eastern Plaguelands<br/><br/>I work hard. I put on a bold face, and find myself slashing and slaying Scourge over and over again. The blood of marauding animals leave a trail for others to find me and I slay them too. <br/><br/>These paladins I find myself working with are almost laughable. But then they have been friends for a long time. Paladin Pals. What I find interesting is one is a Sindorei and the other a dwarf. They give me hope that our differences are not so severe that we can work together.<br/><br/>My skills grow, my muscles and talents are at their peek, and yet...I miss my Leon. I work hard so that I may run by his side, and we could be a paladin pair, terrorizing the lands as we fight alongside each other. The Alliance will soon hear of our might, and fear us!<br/><br/>The night's are cold and lonely. Though I have had offers, I decline them, for they are not my Leon. They would be pale substitutes of what I really and truely want. I have felt his warm strong arms about me, and I have tasted his lips. I have been spoiled, I want only the best.<br/><br/> I want Leon.

Dear Journal,<br/><br/>I find myself following in the footsteps of another Sindorei, a female paladin from the sounds of it. She has left her mark, and there are others here seeking my aid based on how efficient and quickly she handled the jobs handed over to her. Someday I hope I will get to meet her, and thank her. I only heard one name given to this one who goes before me, Jen'tira.<br/><br/>They say the land here is coming back after a terrible Scourge incursion. I have had many encounters with some of them already. I find they do not care for the flames I send their way. Pity, but I care not, they are the Scourge and deserve the purification and destruction that fire can bring them.<br/><br/>I learned that I am close to New Dawn, and I look forward to laying my eyes on it shortly. I cannot help wonder how I will be accepted, but then, I am merely a seamstress and an enchantress. I look for a place to quietly sew and create things of beauty, and taste.<br/><br/>I leave my guildstone on all the time. Sometimes I hear chatting going on, but none are my Kreindis. I await his call to see him once maybe twice before he leaves to fight in Pandaria. I miss him already, and it has only been a few long days. I will be strong, and I will write to him, to let him know my love burns hot within me, and I look forward to seeing him again.

<em> From the Journal of Zakia Sunblade</em><br/><br/><strong> Monday</strong><br/><br/>Two days ago I began my search for the druid Sammuroth Stormfury, in hopes that he may be able to help me with this other personality. I knew finding him would be difficult, according to Bryah, and old family friend who told Rhannah about this druid, he is always in his feline form. Not only that, but my estimation of his strength among the druids tells me he is most likely constantly on the move. In hopes of finding a place to start I traveled first to Thunder Bluff to consult the druids there, after speaking to them, I believe my guess at his power was coorect. Many of the younger druids spoke his name with awe in their voice, the older ones spoke it with great respect, it seems this Sammuroth Stormfury is well known among the druids.<br/><br/>However it seems it is only stories of his exploits they had heard of, only one druid had any clue as to his whereabouts, apparently rumors had been circulating, that Sammuroth was searching all of Azeroth for someone. Who it is the rumors didn't say, but this druid told me that last any had heard from the cat druid he was in the vicinity of Silithus. Slithus even today that place invokes fear, and danger, still predominantly crawling with the bug like silithid, who could this druid be looking for in such a place. The why didn't matter to me, all that mattered was that I had a place to start, so I quickly set out for Tanaris, from there I would travel to Silithus, to find this druid. I spent last night in Gadgetzan, though the goblins disgust me, I had little choice, and I set out this morning heading towards Silithus.<br/><br/>As I neared one of the few active silithid hives in the desserts of Tanaris, I came upon a strange sight, one I hadn't expected so soon. Before me I saw what appeared to be a great white panther, an animal that should not be able to survive the harsh conditions of the dessert. I also saw two more people with the cat, one was clearly a death knight, based on the rune blades he carried, the other was a young kal'dorei girl, who appeared to be a druid.<br/>The three of them were fighting back a horde of undead, not the zombies of trolls, but what appeared to be Scourge, what were the Scourge doing here. What was even more frightening was what led the undead, a doom guard, a frighteningly powerful demon, and yet the cat had the monster on it's heels, while the death knight slaughtered the undead, and the young druid girl provided support.<br/><br/>I do not know how, but instinctually knew that the cat, was Sammuroth Stormfury, and as I watched the battle unfold, I saw why he was so respected. He easily fought blow for blow, with the demon, and as I watched I began to feel excited, excited at thr prospect of challenging this powerful opponent. Even when I was young I would pick fights with those bigger, and stronger than me, not out of any form of arrogance, but simply to challenge myself, and I felt the same excitement I felt back then. I also saw, to my horror, as my body began to move on it's own, the druid and the demon had fallen into the hve, and I knew the other me had taken over.<br/><br/>I cursed myself why hadn't I waited to begin my search until I had met with Master Ji Firepaw, in Orgrimmar, or at least until Rhan had found a way to suppress the darkness. I feared I may lose one of my few hopes of defeating this darkness, I watched through my eyes, but with no control as my body entered the hive. I saw the demon on it's back, it's throat ripped out, the cat standing triumphantly over it, I also saw one of the bug like silithid creeping up behind the druid. Faster than what should have been possible my body sprinted forward, and dispatched the monster, it's dying screams turning the druid around. Like this my body, and the druid faced off, I could see the thanks in the druid's eyes, but it was replaced quickly with suspicion, I imagined a wicked smile on my face, though I could not see it.<br/><br/>(1/2)

I saw the druid crouch down into a fighting stance, and I pleaded that this was simply a nightmare, and I was still asleep in Gadgetzan. The cold reality set in quickly as my body charged forward, blades leading in a complex formation designed to trap the opponent, and give them no avenue of escape. Amazingly the cat saw through the trap, and easily escaped, coming back with an attack of his own, one my body easily dodged, we continued back and forth like this for a few minutes. Our battle must have attracted them, but we soon found ourselves surrounded by silithid, and we simultaneously fought them, and each other, after what seemed like seconds, we were surrounded by dead silithid, some with neat, but vicious sword gashes, some ripped apart by the druid's teeth and claws.<br/><br/>I prayed it was over, but to my horror I heard my own voice, "This is no fun druid, come... come at me with everything you have," I heard myself say. Without waiting for a reply my body charged forward, and I saw the cat's mouth form words for the first time, "As you wish." He took in a deep breath and roared, the shockwave not only rattled the tunnel we were in, it also blew my body back, what power that roar possessed. As I recovered, the druid seemed to just appear right in front of, so fast did he cover the distance between us, before I could react he swiped down with his claws. My body, out of instinct jumped back, the attack only drawing a light line of blood down my chest, tearing my armor as though it were simple butter. The druid did not let up coming at me again, and again, finally battered, and bruised, and scratched up the battle ended. The druid standing virtually unharmed on top of my prone body, the rage in his eyes disappeared as his eyes met mine, perhaps it was the demon inside of him, but somehow he knew, he knew there was something different.<br/><br/>He climbed off of me, and asked, "Who are you, and why did you attack me," how was I to answer, I thought as I tried to catch my breath, I decided the truth was the best course here, so I told him everything. His eyes lit up a bit when I mentioned, Bryah, were the two that close, or was it simply a pride like that a father would have for his child, he was very old after all. As I finished he nodded, " I am sorry for your situation, but I fear I do not know how I can be of help," he said sadly. I pleaded with him to give me advice, I asked him how he dealt with his darkness, he frowned a bit at my inquiry, but he sighed, and spoke, "I control the demon through a mixture of prayer, and faith." My heart sank for we blood elves have no gods to have faith in, or to pray to, I felt a weight on my shoulder, and looked up to see the druid before me, nothing but compassion in his eyes. "There is more to have faith in than deities, is there nothing you have absolute faith in," he asked, I though for a moment before I replied, "The love of my family." <br/><br/>He smiled as father would to a son, "A formidable thing to have faith in, something I have lost, remember that love, and your desire to defend, and protect it. It will will help you when the time comes to face your darkness, that light no matter how small it may appear in the face of your darkness, may be the difference bewteen victory, and defeat." He removed his paw, and turned to walk away, "I pray you defeat your darkness, but know this, if you show your face before me again, before you rid yourslef of that darkness, know that I will not be as merciful as I was today, I will kill you, for your own sake. If however, you challenge me again as yourself, I would like nothing more than to accept your challenge." As he left I said, "Zakia," he turned to look at me, "my name is Zakia Sunblade," he smiled, " I am Sammuroth Stormfury, and I already look forward to our next encounter Zakia Sunblade." He walked away, and there in the doorway of the tunnel stood his companions, the druid girl huffed, and turned away, the death knight smiled, and gave me a thumbs up, apparently he approved of how the encounter ended.<br/><br/>He knew as I did that I would defeat this darkness, and I would challenge Sammuroth Stormfury again, and the next time we met in battle, he would find that defeating me was not going to be as esasy as it was this time. Now it is time for me to meet with the Pandaren, I only prayed that they would be able to give me the help I so desperately needed.<br/><br/>(2/2)

Rhannah tossed and turned in her bed. Sleep that night was being elusive and no matter how hard she tried, her thoughts kept returning to that wonderul, magical night she spent in Rian's arms. The images, instead of being remembered as a time of beauty, were becoming a source of pain. A pain that was proving to be far greater than the pain that she had felt on the night she discovered Micah's betrayal.<br/><br/>She sat up in her bed and hugged her knees close to her body. Tears streamed down her face, falling unchecked onto her blankets as she thought of the monk who had stolen her heart.<br/><br/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiiyq2xrSI0<br/><br/>Rhannah sighed as she tossed her covers back and placed her feet on the floor. There was no point in trying to sleep when sleep refused to come. <br/><br/>She took a stack of paper, a pen and tried to write. Jana has suggested writing a letter to Rian, but the words were stubborn in their refusal to move from her mind to the paper.<br/><br/>Two hours later, she crawled back into her bed, a pile of crumpled paper littering her table One, tear stained page remained. On it, was written the words "My darling, I miss you so much. Please come home."

The summer wind tickled the leaves of the grapes as they ripened in the sun. Rian moved along the rows of sturdy fencing where the grapevines grew. He had to stay busy to keep his mind off of things. <br/><br/>He looked north, the sky was so blue. Clouds were scarce and he knew there would be no rain for at least another day. He walked down to the lake and picked up the buckets. Balancing them on a pole with notches he had made to carry the water. Two buckets at a time he filled and labored uphill to bring water to the grapes. He knew he should probably figure a better way to do it. But for now it kept him busy and fit.<br/><br/>It was dusk before he stopped to get a small meal. His stores were getting low, he would have to go hunting soon. He satisfied himself with some fish and some of the vegetables he had grown in his garden.<br/><br/>As the sun set over the lake he sat on the dock and strummed his guitar. Humming softly he tried to find words to ease the ache in his heart. How could he ever forget her?<br/><br/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_DnSMJBsmM<br/><br/>It was midnight before he was able to bring himself to go into the lake for a refreshing swim. He needed to wash off the grime of the day anyway. Scrubbing himself clean using a handful of sand to get the dirt off his skin, he finished and climbed out of the water. Shivering slightly in the chill of the night air, he walked to the cabin and sat before the fireplace. Drying his hair so he could go to bed without a wet mess. <br/><br/>All night he dreamed of her. longing to see her smile. Ratheron was right, he was not a monk. He was a simple farmer. That is all he would ever be. Rhannah deserved a warrior, a noble who would shower her with riches, and give her a name to be proud of.<br/><br/>In the morning he set out for a hunt, there were stags nearby, a lot of meat to dry and preserve for the coming months. He wished he had studied more with Jana, she had brought him meat before using her bow. He would have to kill one with his sword. Getting close was the hard part.<br/><br/>He skirted the edge of the meadow, the yeti was far away, stomping on the ground and chasing yet another who sought to rid the area of the monster. He did not dare get close to it. He was afraid, he knew he was not strong enough. It had been beaten into him from the time he was very young.<br/><br/>He stopped and watched as lions attacked and killed a stag. He could not compete with them either. Sighing, he went back to the cabin and sat on the docks. Fishing would have to do. He had a feeling he was going to get tired of fish.

<em>Kreindis groans, waking up a little bit. His body hurt, but then again it had been hurting for a while. 'Cursed cousin. Just like him to take a damn argument too far.' Kreindis wore a gray shirt with bandages over his arms and chest. The bandages wouldn't be bloody - none of them that he had been given were.<br/><br/> He reaches over and grabs his journal and quill, before he begins to write a short journal entry.</em><br/><br/>Cursed cousins. I got in an argument about three days ago with my cousin Aenaril, which I admit to myself was a mistake, considering he doesn't have much tolerance or control in arguments, and the fact that he's a fire mage. Now, the result of that argument is the upper half of my body getting the !@#$ burned out of it.<br/><br/>I wish I could contact Zyss - let her know what happened, but the damn healers say: 'You need to rest, or you'll hurt yourself more!' Well damnit I don't want to rest anymore. I have to go to Pandaria in three days, and I want to see Zyss as much as I can in that amount of time...<br/><br/>Maybe I can try and sneak a guildstone call and get her to come visit me here at the Hall of Blood, and get these damn healers away from me. I'm a healer too - I know when I'll be fine. And what makes me even more angry at them - they're keeping me away from Zyss. I tell them that she's the only person I want to come and visit me, and why she is the only person.<br/><br/>But they wont listen to me.
