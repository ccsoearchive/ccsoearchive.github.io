<em>A black leather journal sits beside the bed with him and Zyss laying together in it. A new entry is written in the journal, which was the page the journal was left open to so that the ink could dry.</em><br/><br/> Today was good for.. most of it. The end of the day was... a lot less so. I was outside the auction house at the Royal Exchange, when a woman approached me. She kept trying to get up close to me, being very.. suggestive, while doing so. I kept stepping back, and I feel like an idiot for not just walking away.. I put Zyss through so much pain because of my own idiocy.<br/><br/> Whatever... I just want to forget that happened. I want to forget seeing Zyss the way she was. I want to forget hearing her tell me to go away, watching her turn away from me...<br/><br/> Its alright now though... I explained everything to her, and now we're back to normal. She's sleeping peacefully by me while I watch this - she's comforted knowing that I'm just by her, and that I wont leave her.<br/> <br/> She started kissing me before we fell asleep, on my face, on my neck, and on my chest a little bit too. She opened my shirt as well, before laying her head against it.<br/><br/> On another note, before I finish this entry, I believe I got seven kisses from her today. Two from our picnic at Stillwhisper Pond, the other five from a little bit before we came here, to the inn.<br/><br/> I enjoyed all of them.<br/><br/> <em>Kreindis kisses Zyss' cheek as she lays asleep with his arm around her, and whispers to her softly, "I love you, Zyss."</em>

I finally bought Tyri her own book today. After spending the entire afternoon trying to convince her to eat fruits and cereal, I found out that 'kitty' means cake. For some reason. It was extremely unnerving to have a two-year-old walk around after you, demanding to eat a kitty after you asked if she wanted something to eat. Probably most disturbing, only because when asked if she wanted to see goblins and Night Elves and Draenei (I think?), she responded by saying that they bled strange colors. <br/><br/>Lin is in love with her. I half wonder if he wouldn't wait until she was mature before trying to marry the girl if she keeps this up. A child raised by a violent Blood Knight (imagine my surprise when Kel said, "That's Ang's child." of all things!), and a Death Knight. From what I'd gathered through asking, the Death Knight fathered the child before his death, which makes sense in a manner.<br/><br/>Her violent upbringing shows, she chased me around all afternoon trying to hit me with her sword until I gave in and did what Tyrael does and played swords with her until she got bored, or simply tired herself out for a nap. I'm not sure which happened, the mood change was rapid and without warning. Maybe that's just part of her being a child.<br/><br/>The other disturbing thing that she talked about was playing the silent game. Where she would hide in a small, dark place and be really quiet until her father killed someone threatening them. I can't help at wonder what kind of life she was living out there. It's probably the reason that An'giel thought it wiser to leave her daughter behind as she went out to visit her lover. <br/><br/>I think I'll spend a little more time with Tyri and try to teach her some normal games and songs. I can't imagine that she would grow up to be a healthy, balanced individual if this keeps up. The only good thing I can think of is that she's very bright and very happy, treating many things as if they were games. An'giel did one thing right in that regard, though I can't say that she has been adapting quite well. Or maybe toddlers just think that everything is theirs to begin with. The more I'm around the little one, the more I realize I haven't a clue what's normal and what isn't. <br/><br/>I hope to learn a few things before Zari and Kel's children arrive and well before I'm expecting my own.

<em> From the Journal of Zakia Sunblade</em><br/><br/><strong> Friday</strong><br/><br/>I met some of the member of the Fellowship today, probably one of my older siblings doing, although I suppose they just happened to be meeting where I enjoy taking my naps. The reason, and circumstances do not matter however, for I fear I may have embarrassed my dearest sister Rhanna. I must admit things were going fine, until <strong>He</strong> showed up, Ratheron Firehawk((?)). The man does cut an imposing figure I must admit, but I take pride in not being intimidated by anyone, this man however, caught me off guard.<br/><br/>Asking me all sorts of questions, with Shadow chiming in with questions of her own, who is this Shadow to Ratheron, apprentice, lover, I am not sure, nor do I particularly care. Their questions, about who, and what I am did something I am not used to, they put me back on my mental heels, and as always I responded with my typical arrogance, and tried to dodge the questions. They were not fooled, and I fear that cursed defense mechanism caused me to embarrass Rhanna, I am glad Leon was not there to witness it, he would never let me live it down. <br/><br/>Oh, Rhanna why can I only be myself when it is just the two of us, why do I hide behind a wall of arrogance, and surety when confronted with new people, or uncomfortable questions. You dear sister are the only one who knows the true me, the kind, and compassionate man, the man who would sacrifice anything, if it meant keeping my loved ones safe. I have sighed for what seems like the thousandth time sense that meeting, and I find myself unable to sleep, and so I write my true feelings down.<br/><br/>I have respect for everything the Fellowship has accomplished, and yes I even have respect for Ratheron, but be that as it may, I cannot, and will not allow <strong> Him</strong> to catch me off guard again, I do not think my heart could take embarrassing Rhanna again. I will end this entry here, I must get some sleep for I head to the Ghostlands tomorrow, I cannot afford to be slowed by lack of sleep. I will prove myself to the Fellowship, I will prove myself to Ratheron, and Shadow, and hopefully will make you proud Rhanna.

Hammer on metal, it was a wonder Fyn hadn’t driven the druid’s crazy. The sounds echoed throughout Karnum’s Glade. Steam rose where she cooled several bar of iron. Sweat pouring down her face and arms. A combination of hard work and the serenity of the Glade soothed Fyn, she returned to this spot frequently. On a table nearby sat her journal, open to the newest page, a plate of untouched food sat beside it. <br/><br/>Fyn paused for a moment as rain began to drizzle down, it felt refreshing. She glanced over at her journal getting ready to cover it. Mir, the newest addition to her family took care of it for her, spinning a web like umbrella over top of the journal. This spider was highly intelligent, sensing her masters need to not be disturbed. Fyn nodded to Mir with a smile as the Spider scurried up one of the Glades trees, getting out of the rain. <br/><br/>The huntress took one last look up at the sky, feeling the rain fall on her face. She then returned to her work at the forge.<br/><br/><span class="underline">Caves, Elysium, and Frienship</span><br/><br/><em>Much has happened over the last few days. I’m unsure where to start. Perhaps with Eversong? <br/><br/>I went there looking for copper ore and instead I found an unexpected distraction. Unexpected perhaps, but not unwelcome. Leon, Rhannah’s older brother, was sitting near the pond chatting with a friend. Noralane? I think that was her name, she had the most amazing tattoos! I wasn’t there long before Kel showed up. Then Shadow and Daenith arrived. I have missed Shadow; it was good to see her again! Poor Noralane. Our Fellowship is quite loud and energetic; it’s hard to get a word in edge wise. Even I have problems adjusting to the chaos; I can imagine it wasn’t easy.<br/><br/>Daenith, Carinoth’s mother, questioned me rather thoroughly and threatened me as well. I struggled not to take offence; she is only a mother defending her cub. Even so I feel I survived that conversation quite well, considering she could’ve blown me away with fel magic on the spot. <br/><br/>Ratheron joined us, as well as Rhannah, and we met her younger brother Zakia. He wishes to be a Ranger, a Farstrider. Like Ratheron, I too am unsure of whether or not the boy has what it takes. Only time will tell. Zakia should take him up on his offer of having a teacher. I have heard great things about Rath’s brother and Zakia has much to learn.<br/><br/>We had some good conversations that night, though I had to excuse myself after a time for being around a group of people that long is exhausting to me.<br/><br/>Yesterday I met up with a few of the others in Stonetalon Mountains. The first time I officially joined in on the quest to find Elysium! Kel, Kreindis, and Lineron were there. I think I have finally met Carinoth’s entire family. The experience wasn’t completely unpleasant. I actually find Lineron hilarious in a scary sort of way.<br/><br/>((1/2))</em>

<em>Volunteering to help find a man that can only be found in cave? I am an idiot! Enclosed spaces bring out this irrational fear that I find hard to suppress. If I am focused on a goal and only present for short periods or time, the effects aren’t as bad. <br/><br/>We spent far too long in one cave in particular while searching Feralas. It seemed to be a dwelling for those who practice fel magic, cultists perhaps? It reeked of Yeti, death and foul energy. Rhannah joined us and we soon discovered that Fel Mana potions were being made there. Kel confiscated a few items to give to Ratheron. By this point the cave was starting to get to me. Thankfully I had Lineron’s antics and traps to set up for a distraction. I should ask Lineron if the traps caught anything other than Yeti… <br/><br/>Later we relaxed in the steam pools; the water was amazing! Though the garbage from tourists is something I could’ve done without. <br/><br/>Rhannah showed me the letter Rian had written her. It seems his training with Ratheron did not go well and now he is on the run. Being solitary, and abandoning those who care for him. Claiming that he is sparing Rhannah, but the truth is he is only sparing himself. Though I am fond of the both of them, I must confess to feeling anger towards Rian. The look of pain in Rhannah’s eyes, the sadness, sparked a protectiveness in me that I am unfamiliar with. <br/><br/>This Fellowship as become a family I never expected, and though I may not approve of Rian’s choices or methods, he too is apart of that family. I told Rhannah I would find him, and I will. He seems to frequent Eversong, perhaps if I set up a few traps…?<br/><br/>Later, I told Rhannah I would meet her in Silvermoon. Unfortunately I got distracted by training and by the time I arrived there she was gone. I met a huntress there, whose stories filled me with wanderlust! I cannot wait to go to places like Uldum and Pandaria! What was her name again? Kyetah? Also finally met Kel’s husband Cyaer. Bors is awefully fond of him. I do believe I am getting better at this, at socializing. Perhaps Cyaer and I convinced her to join the Fellowship? I hope so. I liked her. <br/><br/>My hand is sore from all this writing! Time to work off some of the cave tension by bending metal and planning Rians capture…<br/><br/>((2/2))</em>

Scars. We all have them. Some are evident and can be seen clearly. Some even have a story to accompany them. Others are not so clearly seen. Some are buried deep within us, and we forget them, or try to forget them. But we really don't.<br/><br/>I saw my Krie with a white haired woman up close and personal. She had her hands all over him, and I turned away with hot tears in my eyes. Old thoughts and memories came flooding my head with familiar feelings of abandonment and hurt. I ran away, and found myself weeping on an old familiar bench.<br/><br/>Then I saw him walking towards me, having the nerve to ask me what was wrong. The cad. I told him to go away, to leave me alone. I didn't want him to, but I was hurt, and I was angry at myself. I had allowed myself to be hurt again. Think, Zyss, think.<br/><br/>Then he told me what had occurred. She was a stranger! He had backed away instead of run away. He regretted it. And to have seen me so distressed about it, he apologized, and was genuinely sorry. I could hear it in his tone and in the look in his eyes. <br/><br/>I held him tightly, as his put his arms around me. I began to cry afresh, knowing that it had been a misunderstanding, and thinking I had lost Kreindis. I know better now, when he says he loves me, he means it. And I hold on to that more than ever. I asked him if we could stay at the inn, I needed to be close to him, and he said yes.<br/><br/>To say that the startling realization of possibly losing him, and then getting back Krie tired me out. I kissed him as I feel asleep. Next time I won't run away from something like that, I'll confront. I pity the woman that tries to go after my Krei. Ever.

(((posted on the wrong character, sorry))<br/>How can my life be so wonderful and then in a few short days turn into something so horrible? Perhaps my masters are right. Perhaps the calling of a warlock has doomed me to walk alone in life. I do not know. I only know that my heart is breaking for the second time.<br/><br/>I try to console myself with the thought that at least I didn't catch Rian with another woman. That he wasn't unfaithful. But to walk out of my life, leaving behind only a note saying that I deserved better than him? I would so love to shake some sense into him right now.<br/><br/>How can I tell him that there is no one my heart wants more than him? There is no one better for me than him. Those that Rian thinks are better than him are really worse. If they find I am a warlock, they usually do one of three things. Some try to beat me senseless, or worse. Some run as fast as they can, not wanting to be seen associating with one such as me. <br/><br/>Worst of all though, are the ones that claim they don't care, that me being a warlock doesn't matter. Those ones want to be my friend because of one thing. They are closet daemophiles. The men, and the occasional woman, who befriend a warlock just to get access to their succubus terrify me. They are sick, perverted and will stop at nothing to get what they want. Thankfully, I learnt very early to pick up on the subtle cues of a daemophile and make sure they know in no uncertain terms what I think of their perversion. The look on their faces is priceless. How much lower can you get than a warlock telling you you're perverted?<br/><br/>Occasionally I do meet people who genuinely don't care. People like those in the fellowship who can see beyond the stereotype and find the person. They are a rare and unexpected gift and I treasure each one. I feel guilty not telling Shadow or Fyn what I am, but I've had to guard myself for so long that it is hard to trust. It has been so long since I had friends like them, I don't wish to do anything to ruin it. I know that one day I will have to tell them, I just don't want that day to come.<br/><br/>To find a man that could accept me as a warlock, accept me for who I am, and still find room in his heart to love me was a gift I never thought I would find. To have that gift taken from me, is almost too much to bear.<br/><br/>How can I tell Leon what Rian has done? Worse still, how can I tell Zak? I love my brothers so much even though they are so different. If they knew how much I hurt, there would be no holding them back. Rian would not be safe, he would be hunted down mercilessly and dragged back to me. Leon's sense of honour would mean he could do nothing less, and Zak would do anything to see me happy again. They both would. <br/><br/>I hope that the time apart from me brings Rian to his senses and gives him time to think about what is really important to him. But I fear that he has decided on his path and nothing will change that.<br/><br/>I can't allow my pain to take control, I must stay strong. Even though my heart has shattered into a million pieces, I must pick up each one and carry on. The demons I work with will give me no lattitude. If they sense any weakness in me, I will lose my ability to control them and will become useless. If that happens, I will at least have my herbs and my alchemy, but a portion of who I am will have died. <br/><br/>If I cannot have the man I love in my life, that is as the fates will it and I can do nothing to change their minds. I will control what I can. The person I am and how I react to tragedy. Do I run or do I face it, allowing the pain to make me stronger? To help me become a better person? I did not run when my calling revealed itself. I did not run when my masters called me a spoiled brat. I did not run from my first battle. I will not run now. I will stay and face this and I will come through it a stronger, better person.<br/><br/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPj3GAYYZ0

<em> From the Journal of Zakia Sunblade</em><br/><br/><strong> Sunday</strong><br/><br/>My heart is torn, I had hoped to have a challenge in the Ghostlands, but all I found were mindless undead, and savage trolls. Neither group posed much of a challenge, my hope was that maybe my pride would be humbled by meeting an obsticle I couldn't overcome, alas it was not to be. Perhaps my skill grew past what was needed for the Ghostlands too quickly, or perhaps the Ghostlands are not as dangerous as the stories say. Regardless I find myself once again without a challenge, to humble my pride, sometimes it is as if there are two Zakias.<br/><br/>One is the one you know and love Rhannah, the kind, and compassionate man, who would do anything to see you happy, and safe. Then there is the arrogant one, the one that embarrassed you in my first meeting with the Fellowship. I want this other Zakia to be humbled, to be taught that he is not invincible, but how do you do that to yourself. I could walk into a lion's den, but even then I fear it will not be enough, for this other me, has an uncanny ability to accomplish the seemingly impossible. So what then do I do, oh Rhannah do you have the answer, because I do not, and I find myself more, and more thinking that perhaps I should just let this other me be the only me.<br/><br/>So with a heart in turmoil I headed to a small gathering of member of the Fellowship, on the way I wondered which me would show up. Fortunately it was the kind Zakia that arrived at that beach, the Zakia that was embarrassed of himself. I spent the majority of the time sitting on the beach practicing fishing, my faithful panther cub next to me. While I sat there alone, trying to keep my distance from the others out of embarassment, one of my companions approached, and asked to sit with me. I discovered that her name was Wyn, and we had a pleasant conversation, but I couldn't be sure if there was something off behind her smile.<br/><br/>If there was, fortunately I was saved from whatever she was plotting, by Fynnariel, perhaps the only true friend I have made in the Fellowship so far. She is the only one besides you my dear sister, who has a kind word, and friendly advice, the only other one I can truly be myself around. I admit after Wyn left, our topic of conversation turned to my first meeting with Ratheron, and I snapped out at her in anger, after which I sincerely apologized. I do not want to jeapordize this budding friendship, for she may be the one who can give me the answer to getting rid of this other me. I must admit I feel a deep caring for her similar to the caring I feel for you Rhannah, perhaps it is just my desire to protect those I care about, I cannot be sure right now.<br/><br/>The rest of our time was spent talking together, and meeting other members of the Fellowship, I enjoyed the night immensely, besides the good companionship, I enjoyed the fact that the other me stayed away for the most part. Although before I left the conversation took a strange turn, to someone named Riandron, who seems to be close to you Rhannah. I got the feeling everyone there knew something I didn't, and it frustarted me to the point that I excused myself, as I was preparing to leave, Kyetah, another new member whispered something strange to me, "Stay out of it, let them sort it out themselves." Or something along those lines, regardless of the exact wording, what did she mean, and who was she talking about, perhaps I should pay you a visit tomorrow Rhannah, but if I did would you tell me what is going on?<br/><br/> Tomorrow I return to my duties in Hillsbrad, will this once beautiful place give me the challenge that I seek, time will tell, but will I be able to focus on my tasks with this mystery hanging over my head, if not I fear the other me will once again take over.

Some weeks I feel like the fates are conspiring against me. This week is turning into one of those weeks.<br/><br/>Not only has Rian walked out of my life through some misplaced sense of inadequacy, but the next day, Micah turned up and tried to sleaze his way back into my bed. What ever did I see in that man? I have no idea. I sent him packing. I may not have Rian by my side, but there's no way I will let a snake like Micah take his place.<br/><br/>I made the mistake of telling Leon about Micah's visit and the next thing I know, Leon's racing off to find him. The two have always been rivals, although it was friendly rivalry when they were children. As they grew towards adulthood, something happened and Micah developed an intense hatred of my older brother. For my sake, they settled into a sort of cold war while Micah and I were dating.<br/><br/>It heated up however when Leon found out about what Micah had done and my handsome brother, so dedicated to the blood knight order, with his deeply ingrained sense of honour and justice, swore that he would make Micah pay for hurting me as badly as he did.<br/><br/>After Leon left to chase after Micah, I used the guildstone to see if anyone had seen him. They hadn't, but Jana and Fyn came out to the Enclave to help me find my brother. Fyn's bear was able to track him to the flight master at Light's Hope Chapel. From there we found he had flown to the Undercity. As it was getting late, we decided to resume the chase in the morning.<br/><br/>I wish I could take the men in my life and give them all a good shake to make them wake up to themselves. At least there is one small mercy in all of this. With Leon so focused on Micah, he's not chasing after Rian. That just leaves Zak. I'm much more confident that I can stop him from doing anything stupid, but then, I have seen hints of a darker side to my little brother lately. Perhaps I may have more trouble with him than I wish.

Silvermoon entry:<br/><br/>I haven't whispered it. I have kept it as secret in my heart for oh these past few short days. And now I must put it to paper so I never, ever forget that date with a dream.<br/><br/>It was special. So very special, Leon needed to escort me to the place he wished to be with me that evening. There were ogres and ogre magi, and we sped through it virtually unscathed. And we walked onto the beach of a resort. But even this wasn't the place, he merely picked up a basket of food and we found ourselves sitting on a long pier, alone with the stars just coming out as the sunset painted the sky in glorious color.<br/><br/>He has bought wine, and we sat and sipped on it and talked. I could listen to him for hours, and I found myself growing more comfortable in his presence. And the wine was good, and letting me be more open with him without so much restraint. <br/><br/>Dinner was delicious, and after, or were we still eating? I forced myself into his lap. I wanted his arms around me and I found I loved his kisses. It was hard for me to hold back, but he was trying so much to be the gentleman. Oh, my sweet Leon.<br/><br/>It began to rain, and we were soon soaked to the skin, however it was a warm rain, and still we kissed and held each other, keeping one another warm in our loving embrace. I'm finding him to be someone that could...does complete me. <br/><br/>Journal, hold this secret close. Let me live this again and again as I read the words and feel those lips upon my own. Never let me forget the desire and passion he fills my heart and body with. Light, journal, I want him so badly.

<em>A tropical storm was coming into the mainland where Kel and he called home. The rain came down in torrents, and yet Cyaer sat on the end of their wooden landing ramp. The winds whipped the rain about, striking his bandaged body and leaving small welts where small particles of ice struck him. Lightning flashed all around him as did the great deep rumbles of thunder, yet he did not move. His body was in deep meditation, while his mind focused on something more dire than a mere storm.<br/><br/>She had been lovely the noble Kal'dorei noblewoman, of this Cyaer had been certain. And she must have found him attractive, for several times she asked him to meet in private. He saw it in her eyes, the hunger and desire. And he told her no. He didn't explain himself, he was happily married to the mother of his children, Kel'tira. Kim'Dracon. He needed no one or anybody else but her.<br/><br/>Still she pressed him, while he focused on the matter at hand in Stormwind, the white stoned capitol of the Alliance. On that final night while all the others celebrated, Cyaer had prepared to leave, packing his things and resting. She had come in naked, and still offered herself to him. The sin'dorei had gotten up disgusted, and left. Leaving the noblewoman stunned that one would reject what she had to offer.<br/><br/>It had been months, since that night, and Cy had all but forgotten the incident. He was trying to reclaim that love of fishing he so wanted in the warm waters of the Wilds. And he had been focused on the fishing and not the surroundings. A near fatal mistake. There were five to his one.<br/><br/>They had told him that the Lady demanded his presence, there was no doubt that they were here to force him to come. Otherwise, they said something about his family, a bad move on their part. He fought them as best he could. One of the night elf assassins died to the snapping jaws of the indigenous crocolisks abundant in the area. They tried to subdue him, and he took several heavy hits to his body. But he saw something that might help. <br/><br/>He took as deep a breath as he could as he managed to get them all to fall in the water with him. He hoped the bleeding from their beating would draw the great white. And it came upon them like a nightmare. Cy knew one of them had been chewed on as the water turned red with whomever's blood. The beast drew their attention as he floundered to his small raft. <br/><br/>And he called for Imp, with barely a whisper. The large Pandaren mount could only watch as Cy tried to climb on. Once the rogue was on it rose from the raft, just as three pairs of hands tried to grab at it. With a great and terrible roar it took its near dead master to the last place he had come from...home.<br/><br/>Cy didn't remember how he got inside the house, but he fell injured and nearly dead on the floor. If it had not been for Kel'tira's fortuitous return to their home, he wasn't sure what would have happened.<br/><br/>As it is, Kel'tira and he have plans to go to find the Lady. In Cy's mind there will be no more threats from one such as she. His only concern - a pregnant Kel'tira alongside him.</em>

<em>The woman rested in her small apartment in the mage area. A small wineglass floated nearby awaiting the order to return as she looked over the new journal she had purchased. Wyn had kept one ever since she was only a slip of a girl. This would be the fourth one to be inscribed by her, detailing her life and the changes therein. She gently broke the spine to allow her to write without holding the backside down. The pen dipped into ink and awaited her command...</em><br/><br/>I have found an invitation into the illustrious Rising Sun Fellowship. I have long heard of them and some of their exploits, up to and including the most recent events. The Firehawks thing doesn't bother me, but the prestige of being in this guild will aid me in my career. Just as I will aid them as best as I can within my abilities.<br/><br/>Speaking of abilities, I have found a young apprentice that shows an amazing natural abilitiy for magic, particularly with fire, a man after my own heart. He has only learned specific spells from reading and testing what he has learned. It has worked for him, for he thrives and lives yet. In other words, he hasn't blown himself up so far. I am preparing a course of study for him to follow to aid him further. I think it will be most interesting.<br/><br/>I was fortunate enough to meet some of the members of the Fellowship. They all seem very friendly and outgoing, though I think the one named Fynnariel isn't quite used to the meeting in a crowd. And a young man sat a part from the rest, I went and talked with him briefly before I had to leave. He seemed reserved and quiet, it took all my skills to get him to speak at all. Pity really, he seems to have so much potential just as my new apprentice does.<br/><br/><em>Wyn blew across the page to dry the ink as she allowed the pen to settle beside the bottle of ink. Then with a gentle sweep of her fingers the journal closed. The wineglass appeared beside her, and she sipped it delicately. She settled back into her comfy chair and smiled. </em>

Her small button nose suited her, as did the sprinkling of freckles across it. <br/><br/>She stopped brushing as she gazed at her reflection. Zyss studied her lips. She had always thought they were her best feature. Full and delicious looking, not too red and a more like a blush of pink that suited her face. She stuck her tongue out at her reflection, giggling as she did so.<br/><br/>Kreindis was on her mind. He normally was. And as it was bedtime, even moreso. Zyss looked down at the soft comfortable shirt he had given her. His scent was still in the fabric, and she relished it's manly odor. Her reflection closed its eyes, as she thought of that night not to long ago.<br/><br/>His frame was strong and muscular as she lay with him in the inn. She found touching his face, his hands, and his chest comforting in a way. His face for the noble chin and rugged handsomeness of it. His hands for the gentle way they could wipe a tear from her eye, to enclosing her delicate fingers within it without injury. And his chest, well that was Zyss' secret sin. She loved to feel those tight firm muscles, and the warm skin. She felt secure and protected being held to Krei's chest. <br/><br/>She opened her eyes to see her reflection doing the same. She set down her brush, and stood, hugging herself, and delighting in his scent all around her. She stepped lightly to the bed and slipped under the blanket. She knew she would dream of him, and his strong arms around her, and his soft tender lips upon her own. It has become her favorite dream, a dream of her paladin, Kreindis.<br/><br/>As she turned and lay her head on the pillow, she whispered a quiet good night to him, wherever he might be, and closed her eyes.</em>

Plaguelands<br/><br/>I find it bizzare that I am working with a dwarf, a gilnean, and a fellow sindorei. And yet, I am finding going off on jobs with different races not only fun, but I am learning so much from them too. And they were moving in the direction I was headed - New Dawn. So why not earn a few silver and copper along the way?<br/><br/>While I fight across the Plaguelands, I seek to work myself to a point of exhaustion. So when I lay down, I sleep dead to the world. No dreams to haunt my mind. Yet, I can not stop it, it still washes over me in my slumber.<br/><br/><em>I am on that long pier, and Leon is holding me close. His lips are warm and tender and I feel a part of me falling away from me. A part that is hard and tough. I am left exposed, a woman falling in love with a good man. I find myself yielding to his kissing and his arms. and I want him to take me away. Away from the war and combat, and allow myself to be his and his alone. To give up all that I am to him, and to release these pent up passions and desires.<br/><br/>I yearn for his sweet touch to ignite those fires deep within me. And to allow me to release my feminine to his masculine. To heal me of the aching need I feel here in my heart. <br/><br/>I cry out to him...Leon, Leon...and he does not answer.</em><br/><br/>The dream leaves me anxious and bearing a burden I have never felt before. I need him, and want him so much.

I have had a lot to think over the past week or so. An'giel hasn't returned and Tyri often bounces around the Spire. Rath thinks we ought to buy her a puppy, though judging by his expression, I'm not altogether convinced that he simply doesn't want one. I still worry that she would be far too rough on it, as I have been trying to coax her to being gentle and playing nice. More often than not, she gives me a sweet, angelic little smile before smacking me with her little wooden sword.<br/><br/>I do not know how to approach my training with Mei, or where to begin. I couldn't do to her what Ratheron does. What he did to me, what he did to Rian. He believes in breaking someone down, then building them strong. It works, I'm certain. The veterans he had come and assist in the training certainly didn't seem put off by the entire ordeal, though I had to apologize to Ashok and Tai for their wasted time. <br/><br/>Secretly, I have to admit that I would have liked to be in the fray. Not to attack anyone, but to go through that training. I love testing myself. Even though I know I would fail, I would get hit, I would get hurt, I trust in Ratheron.<br/><br/>A student must trust their master. <br/><br/>I suppose I did from the beginning. I respect the Masters of Serenity Peak a great deal. They wouldn't throw me in harm's way. My own nature is a bit self-destructive, Ratheron had to pull me back more than shove me forward. To let me realize these things for myself. To let me be the one to approach him.<br/><br/>Every day is a new lesson.<br/><br/>But I am not Rian, and he is not me. Mei is not like either of us. I suppose I will need to earn her trust, first. There is no need to break down what doesn't exist.

Kyetah sat upright in her bed, the last images from her nightmare still haunting her vision. She rubbed her hands over her face in a futile attempt to rid herself from the nightmare's hold and bring herself back to the land of the waking.<br/><br/>The window near her bed bathed her with the light of the false dawn, heralding that the true dawn was moments away. She sighed and threw back the covers. There was no point in trying to sleep any longer. The breaking of the day signaled a time when the inn below her would be coming to life and there were just too many memories associated with that time of morning.<br/><br/>The huntress dressed in her armour and made her way to the stables. Perhaps some hunting would banish the last remnants of the nightmare. But she knew she was kidding herself. Nothing would.<br/><br/><em>The dream was a mixture of all the elements of her past. The time she had run away from home as little more than a child and spent her first night on the streets crying, alone and so terribly frightened. The time she had turned her first trick, all the time repulsed by the naked lust in the man's eyes. <br/></em><br/><br/>Kyetah shuddered at the memory of the things she had been forced to do during that time of her life.<br/><br/><em>The dream had continued as she was forced to watch a younger version of herself dragged to a brothel by someone who had actually become concerned about her welfare. She may have been doing the same sort of things as she would have been if she was still on the streets, but at least that time she had somewhere warm and safe to sleep at night, she had plenty to eat and she was actually able to learn skills that would help support her which had nothing to do with giving men pleasure. </em><br/><br/>The huntress smiled as she remembered Jorel and his patience with her as he taught her how to use a bow. She knew he had a sadistic side, she had seen it with the other girls, but with her, he was kind and patient. His weekly training sessions were often the only break she got. He always made sure that when they returned to her brothel he made it look like she had been doing her job, not learning how to hunt so that she could leave.<br/><br/><em>Her dream shifted again, moving to the time when she had become the madam. Thankfully, that time was short. She had encouraged the girls to learn other skills, find other ways of supporting themselves. The few that actually enjoyed the work, she found places for with other brothels and slowly, she took the brothel and turned it into a tavern, restoring to it, and her a measure of respectability that enabled her to hold her head high in public.<br/><br/>After a few years of her running the tavern, all but a few of the Dalaran residents had forgotten that it ever was a brothel. Life was good. Then came the day of the purge. the day when the Silver Covenant turned on the Sunreavers and kicked them out of Dalaran. She was lucky. One of her former clients had managed to get word of what was happening to her in time and she was able to get out of the city with most of her belongings and her animals. The tavern had to be left behind. Kyetah had woken from that dream turned nightmare with the sound of her friends screams ringing in her ears.</em><br/><br/>Kyetah found her dragonhawk Zephyr and took him hunting. The graceful way he floated in the air was always soothing and helped her shake the last of her nightmare from her mind.<br/><br/>She walked in the light of the dawn thinking about her life. What was she to do with herself? She couldn't hunt forever, and she refused to go back to her old ways. She snorted at that thought. The years of hard living on the streets had taken their toll on her and she knew her body wasn't able to handle that sort of life any more. <br/><br/>She could start another tavern, possibly one in Silvermoon City, among her own people but she couldn't stop the past from haunting her whenever she thought of trying. Even when others said they didn't care about her past, she couldn't shut out the voices, the accusations of her own mind. She couldn't shake the feeling that she was never going to be good enough. That life would be easier if she just stuck with hunting. At least animals didn't judge the way people did.
