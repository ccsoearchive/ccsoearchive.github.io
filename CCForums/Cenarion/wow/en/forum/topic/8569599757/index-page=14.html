I struck out at him, jumping into the air and diving with the point of my left-handed sword, he dodged to the right and deflected the second strike with his blade as pushed up against me, forcing me to the ground as we stood toe to toe. I was taller than him yet he matched me strength, outmatched me really as I was forced to spin to the right, yet he was there when I stopped the spin. He launched a flurries of blows.<br/><br/>From my mind's eye I watched them from the position of a spectator, the first came in from the high angle of the right, a crosswise slice yet it was a feint that led to his next attack which was a thrust, it forced me backwards as I blocked it with crossed blades. But he did not let that stop him, using my own force against me he put it into the momentum of his next attack, letting the blade slide into the dirt and the extra force helping push him forward with his right fist launched at my chest.<br/><br/>I didn't expect it, I had not expected a man who appeared to be fighting with the one-handed swordfighter's style to use his fist and I found myself on my back for a brief moment before I rolled and swept out his legs from under him. He landed on his back but then brought me down again with him. Our weapons had been lost and now it was fists, my specialty. Yet this man launched a flurry of attacks, using his entire body to help position himself into better striking positions.<br/><br/>I found that while I might be the master of hand to hand combat when standing, this man knew how to fight on the ground. I did what I could, pulling my knees to my chest and pushing them against his, to keep him back, yet he was still able to find ways to strike at my kidneys and face. I blocked many of the blows but soon they were coming faster and faster. I did not let my annoyance at this show on my face as I launched a blast of Chi energy directly into Striker's face, the man reeled from that, pulling away and rolling backwards onto his feet. He was kneeling in the dirt, looking over at me.<br/><br/>I was now on my feet and lowered into a fighting stance. I did not need my weapons. I would fight without them. They would simply hinder me and slow me down. He didn't go for his, merely charging straight at me, but I saw it out of the corner of my eye. His blade, coming to his hand and so I moved without thinking. I launched myself at his left arm and caught the blade and arm before they reunited, the blade I batted to the side, letting it spin off away from us but the arm I attempted to break but the armor held fast even as I brought heavy elbows and palms against it. But I had accomplished what I wanted and so I retreated.<br/><br/>I stepped back and again launched a blast of Chi energy at Striker, but this time the man met it with one of his own. I was in shock at this point. How could a man who did not train as a monk use energy like a monk! It was maddening. I moved back into close quarters with him and one our feet we were evenly matched, I blocked most of his attacks and launched many blows against his armor. But it held fast, I could not penetrate it and thus I knew that while I might hold my own in this fight. Eventually he would win.<br/><br/>Simply through attrition. But then the unexpected happened. He caught my right hand against the side of his body as I went for a kidney shot, as if he had left an opening specifically for this and his left enclosed my neck with the strength of an ox. I tried to break free but there was nothing I could do. He slowly picked me up off the ground and then released my right arm. I used both to try and break the armor, to do anything I could to break that grip.<br/><br/>I felt the hot steel of his blade against my neck and knew I was defeated.<br/><br/>"Well fought monk. The mistake you made was discarding your weapons. The mistake you made prior to that was in not learning about the armor I wear. The mistake even before that one, was in your own self-confidence that you could beat me in a fight."<br/><br/>Striker said this as I was tossed like a rag doll into the wall of the ring. Tyrael howled with rage and launched himself at the man, that fight lasted a mere minute as Tyrael and Striker traded weapon blows, the ring of steel was all I could hear, but I was later told that Tyrael threw everything he had at the man.<br/><br/>He launched overhands, underhands, feints and ripostes but he didn't break through Striker's defenses. Striker gave ground before the Elf warrior but it was merely to let Tyrael's rage play out. As I feared Striker knew how to defeat Tyrael and when Tyrael mistimed a strike, his opponent struck out. Launching a pommel strike to Tyrael's chest, but he did not stop there, grabbing Tyrael by the scruff of his chainmail he through the elf down onto the ground.<br/><br/>((2/3))

Discarding his weapon Striker grabbed Tyrael with both hands and threw him into the air, pulling out a whip-like chain that he caught Tyrael with some thirty feet in the air. Striker pulled down and Tyrael came crashing into the ground but not before Striker caught him and started to pummel the Sin'dorei with fists. He then had Tyrael barely standing on his own strength, throwing a back kick into Tyrael's chest and letting him land next to me in the dirt against the edge of the ring.<br/><br/>"Anyone else want to test my fighting prowess?"<br/><br/>It was the last thing I heard before I blacked out from the pain.<br/><br/>((3/3))

I do not believe I could, for she is not the only one that brings out these feelings, there is another, Kyetah, the first person I even let into my turmoil over my other personality, the one who helped me find the courage to tell Rhan. Who would have thought that such a first meeting would lead to this, but again I thought, it is impossible for her to love me any more than a close friend, but again I may have been proven wrong. After she contacted me I immediately made my way to the guest house, Shade was coming as well to deliver some meat, but she came a little after me. I arrived first, and apologized that I was so late, she simply smiled, and said, "Well you are here now, that's all that matters," could this have been the first clue to her feelings? Of course I did not comprehend that possibility, so I set to work to make up for arriving so late, Shade arrived not long after, and went in to help Kye with dinner.<br/><br/>I do not know what they talked about, what was said, but Shade left before dinner, claiming to be sick, she did look pale, but I am not entirely convinced, that there wasn't something else that caused her sickness, oh to have been a fly on the wall in that kitchen. I wished Shade well, and I admit I watched her leave with a hint of sadness, soon after she left Kye, and I went down to the docks for a swim. I think Kye was surprised that I agreed to join her this time, but we enjoyed the cool refreshing wtater, and even played around by splashing each other. It was the most fun I had in ages, it was stopped cold, when Kye tickled my sides, though she seemed to not care if I got her back in the same way, I just couldn't bring myself to do it. Yet another sign, I believe, of Kye's feelings that I was too stupid to understand. <br/><br/>By that time dinner was about ready so we went back to the house, and the most delicious smell entered my nose, I knew before even tasting it, that the food was going to be the most delicious thing I had ever eaten. Before we ate however, we shared a drink, Kye sitting on the bar counter me standing there not knowing what to do with myself. Again the situation took a strange turn, as she asked me why I blush around her, and Shade, and not around other women. I told her honestly that both of them make me feel differently than other women, and that my feelings are confusing me to the point of madness. I expected advice, but was surprised at the advice she gave me, which was to talk to Shadow, the fiance of Ratheron. Shadow seemed like the last person I would want to talk to about this, could I even hold her attention long enough to get all the words out.<br/><br/>She is a monk, so I do not doubt she has a serious side to her, but I have never seen it, she seems to like to tease, and play pranks, more than she likes to sit, and listen, and of course there is always the possibility of running into him, if I talk with her. I trust Kye's judgement though, so I think I will attempt to get the monk to listen to me, and perhaps she can help me sort out my feelings, and help understand, if Kye's, and Shade's feelings are really there, or just my heart wishing for something that isn't. The two women's feelings seem so obvious to me now, but is it true, or just my heart wanting it to be. If your feelings are true Kye, I am sorry again that I am too stupid, and naieve to see it, and to understand my own feelings.<br/><br/>If both of their feelings are true, who should I choose I don't want to hurt anyone, but I also cannot have them both, fel damn it what has my heart gotten me into. I plan to speak with Shadow tomorrow evening, tonight I stay in the guest house, as far away from where Kye sleeps as possible. I think it best for tonight that we both have some space to sort out everything that is happening, I have taken another day of abscence from my duties in Northrend, I am not sure putting myself on the battlefield in my current emotional state is the wisest choice.<br/><br/>(2/2)

<em>Hurried penmanship written in the pages of Fynnariel’s Journal:</em><br/><br/>I spotted him today…the Forsaken I am hunting. I know him only by the fact that he carried a jewel adorned box. The box was the only detailed thing the High Executioner saw fit to share with me. Using my eagle eye to spy the surround area, I discovered him peeking into the box near the Giants Run. My prey then looked up, as though he sensed me watching. He is heading north and east, towards the frigid ocean and the treacherous cliffs nearby. Soon I will come upon the location where I spotted him, there my pets will have his scent and eluding us will be most difficult.<br/><br/>What troubles me most about his actions is that he was clearly standing in the open. The Undead was waiting to be discovered. This prey is most certainly leading me into a trap. It excites me, but I will observe caution with this one…

The day was warm and Rian was determined to get his work done and go back to be with Rhannah. He made no secret of his journey to his winery. He had daily tasks that had to be done. Watering being the biggest part of it. <br/><br/>He had to figure out a way to get water to the vines easier. This was backbreaking labor. Walk down to the Lake, fill the buckets, walk back to the garden. Water row after row of vegetables and the grapes. He finished by early evening and stopped to grab a bite before calling his wolf for the long ride back to the settlement.<br/><br/>By the time he was back to New Dawn, it was near dusk and he had no idea where she was. He would be there for Rhannah when she returned from her work. He had promised her he would be there for her. He was too tired to even bother hiding his walking into her house. There was time for him to set a pot of stew on the stove and add some fresh veggies along with the rabbit he had snared in his garden that morning. <br/><br/>As tired as he was, he made sure to bank the fire so the stew would cook slowly. He sat on the bed fully clothed, too worn out to undress. Laying back he decided to take a nap.

<em>The two women were browsing the shops of Silvermoon City, and stopped at a women's apparel store. They were looking at dresses and assorted sundries, when Wyn asked, "Darling, what do you wear to bed each night?"<br/><br/>Zyss shyly spoke, "I wear a shirt that Krei gave me, it carries his scent and I like to hold it against me at night." <br/><br/>"Oh, dear, that may work when you are with him, of course," as Wyn rolled her eyes, "However a lady should wear a nightgown to bed away from him. I cannot see how you could have been wearing a man's shirt for sleepwear out on the road. My goodness!" The mage searched through several shelves and racks of items but could not find one that fit her taste or rather would wear well on Zyss.<br/><br/>"I do believe I have just what the tailor ordered at home. It's one of my older ones, but should fit you well, and will be very comfortable for you, my dear. Did you see anything else you liked, Zyss? Really, It's my treat."<br/><br/>Zyss shook her head coyly, "No, Wyn, I don't see anything here. And I don't want to put you out for a gown to sleep in. I'll find something somewhere else, alright?"<br/><br/>Wyntar smiled warmly at her newfound friend, "Pish posh, it's no trouble, dear friend, and you would be doing me a favor in taking one or two, I barely have enough closet space as it is, really, you would be helping me in taking a few quite honestly."<br/><br/>Zyss nodded silently. And the two women left the store to search for a few more things as they shopped and looked at the various stores. and vendors. Finally, they decided to rest in a nice cool place with a bit of shade. Wyntar had purchased a pleasant aperitif that was light and fruity, and they sat and enjoyed the brief respite.<br/><br/>As they were not far from her apartments, Wyn persuaded Zyss to come and to pick out two or three sleeping gowns to take with her. Zyss was taken in by how large the mage's apartment was, and all the fine things she had collected and had on display. Several walls were filled with books on all matter of subjects. She felt very out of place here, much like the country mouse at the city mouse's home.<br/><br/>Wyntar invited Zyss into her bedroom, and Zyss was astounded by all the satin, and lace. "Oh, this is my sanctuary from the world outside, Zyss, I like to think it is an extension of myself. Please, have a seat as I search for the gowns."<br/><br/>Zyss noted that the room had the mild fragrance of the perfume she wore, only different. Then she realized it was the scent that Wyntar wore, and she smiled. It was a very light and delicate scent, and very feminine. She hoped the same thing was thought of when her perfume was smelled.</em><br/><br/>(1 of 2)

<em>Wyn came out with several beautiful gowns that made Zyss gasp at the beauty and delicate stitching of the slender garments. The mage laid them out on the bed, spread out so Zyss could pick and choose the one she thought she might like to have or use.<br/><br/>"Oh, Wyn, I can't! They all are so beautiful, they must have cost a fortune. I cannot accept even one of them..."<br/><br/>Wyn stood and came over to take Zyss's hands within her own. She looked into the pretty warlock's eyes, and smiled, then whispered softly, "Oh, please, I already said you would be doing me a favor. Besides, many of these were purchased by anxious suitors and those trying to win my favor. So they cost me nothing. Please, for me, won't you try on a few, and maybe take one, or two, or four?" Wyn then giggled lightly.<br/><br/>Zyss nodded, and her eyes lit upon several that she fancied, then turned to Wyn, "Are you sure?" And Wyn nodded. <br/><br/>There were four that Zyss found simply amazing, and so beautiful. She picked them out, and Wyn congratulated her on having such good taste. Zyss blushed at the compliment, and wasn't sure what to do.<br/><br/>Wyn told her to take off her robes and to try them on, to see how they fit. Even as Zyss started to make an objection, Wyn shushed her. "I'm a seamstress, and you are my customer, would you hesitate if you were in a shop? Besides we are friends, so take it off!? Again she giggled, and Zyss joined her.<br/><br/>As Zyss placed the first one over her head, she could smell the heady fragrance of Wyn's perfume on the gown. She straightened it out, and turned to see Wyn's reaction. Wyn directed her to the full mirror on the wall. As Zyss stood before the mirror, she didn't think she had ever worn anything so light and airy as this gown. Wyn stood behind her, looking over Zyss' shoulder. She had a warm smile as she looked into the mirror. <br/><br/>She whispered softly into Zyss' ear, "Now that's how a lady dresses for sleep. Look at how it forms to you, Oh, Zyss, you look so lovely. So lovely..."<br/><br/>They all fit Zyss nicely, the last one was a bit more risque, but as Wyn whispered into her ear, it was for her, to let her feel feminine and pretty for herself. Zyss nodded, and looked into her reflection. She did look pretty, and she felt pretty in it. Wyn looked over her shoulder, and nodded. And Zyss detected something in her friend's eyes. She thought she saw a desire there, a hunger. And blushed at her thoughts.<br/><br/>After redressing in her robe, the two of them had dinner, and several times Zyss felt the same thoughts as Wyn looked at her through the dinner. She was flattered, and even a litte tempted, but she had Kreindis...didn't she?</em><br/><br/>(2 of 2)

[I] From the Journal of Zakia Sunblade[/I]<br/><br/><strong> Thursday</strong><br/><br/>Anger, fury, vengeance, these are the foremost emotions, and desires right now, I never thought anything could make me feel this way again, after Micah’s death, but I was wrong. I thought last night, would be a time of peaceful reflection, after I spoke with Shadow about my current situation, surprisingly, she had some good insight into the subject, I guess Kye was right she isn’t always so flighty. After she left, I had intended to stay at the beach for the remainder of the night, perhaps do a little fishing, and reflect on what she had said. Apparently fate had other ideas, soon after Shadow left, I heard Shade’s faint voice over the guildstone, I had never heard her sound like that, so I immediately deduced something had happened. She wouldn’t tell me over the guildstone, she just asked that I bring her the bandages she gave me, I immediately set out for Ashenvale, hoping beyond, hope I would get there in time.<br/><br/>I found her, on top of a small rise near Azshara, barely moving, trying to staunch the flow of blood, when I saw her in that state I could feel my fury blazing up. For her sake I kept it under control, and helped her dress her wounds, she tried to sit up, after the bandages were in place, but the blood loss caused her to collapse forward, where I quickly caught her. I had to prevent her from laying on the ground, no matter how well dressed a wound is, there is still a chance it could get infected, so I held her, and talked with her. She doesn’t want to be alone, and I told her she wasn’t alone, that I was there, and that she had better not die on me, we both still have so much to learn about each other. I will not let fate make my decisions for me, I will learn about these two women, Kye, and Shade, I will learn everything there is to know about them, and I will make my decision, no one else.<br/><br/>I stayed with her until she finally awoke, I made sure she would be ok, and offered to take her wherever she wanted to go, she waved my offer off saying she would be fine, and I hoped she was right.<br/><br/>Still even after I knew she was ok, my fury would not abate, and so I returned to Northrend, and I killed, I killed undead, I killed leftovers from Malygos’ forces, I killed animals, anything that crossed my path died. This time it wasn’t my other personality, it was me, me playing out my fury, that I couldn’t protect Shade, my fury at my own worthlessness, for if I couldn’t protect Shade, how could I think I could protect anyone. How could I protect Rhan, Kye, Fyn, the members of the Fellowship how could I help them, and protect them, if I couldn’t protect one person, I do not think my heart could bear it if Kye were to be injured as well. So I killed, and slaughtered everything in my path, looking for some relief to my torment, eventually I came upon a small camp of magnataur, and they to met my fury, and were slaughtered. As I stood in the midst of their corpses, laughter turned my head, to see a man sitting casually on a small outcropping of stones.<br/><br/>He was laughing, and clapping his hands, as though he approved of what I had done, next to him stood a succubus, and the look in her eyes as she stared at the man, was one of complete devotion. The man stood up and spoke, “Well, done I like your ferocity boy, but any novice can kill magnataur, let’s see how you fair against this,” he snapped his fingers, and a felguard charged out form behind the rocks. I barely had time to react, to jump out of the way of the demon’s attack, and it came on relentlessly, but much like when my other personality takes over, my senses were at their peak, and my reflexes honed to a razor’s edge. The demon couldn’t touch me, not in my current emotional state, for the first time, I was channeling my fury, and no lower ranked demon could match me. I dodged, I parried, I counterattacked, until the demon was covered in it’s blood from all of the damage I had inflicted, the demon gave one final half hearted swing, which I slid under, and came up with my sword leading in an upward arc, cutting the demon from groin to chin.<br/><br/>(1/4)

Needless to say the demon was dead before it hit the ground, I looked back at the man with a superior look, but my confidence vanished when I saw he was still laughing, cackling would actually be a better word to describe it. Still laughing the man spoke, “Very impressive I can see why my brother has taken such a liking to you.” I looked at him strangely, his brother, to my knowledge I have never met anyone the resembles this man, who had, “taken a liking to me.” He continued to laugh at my expression, “Fool boy you wouldn’t recognize me by a family resemblance, for you see my brother, is Sammuroth Stormfury,” my eyes widened, Master Stormfury? A man who kills demons without a second thought, who is possessed by a demon, much to his chagrine, has a brother who is a warlock, it didn’t make any sense. Not only that, but this man seemed quite insane, the complete opposite of Master Stormfury, as I watched him the man jumped down, or more specifically he floated down.<br/><br/> He smiled at me, “My brother always did have an eye for talent, but even though you are quite skilled, I know you can be better, darker, a pure killing machine, who care nothing of who he hurts.” Again was surprise was evident, how did he know, the man chuckles, “Fool I have been following your progress ever since you met my brother, and can I just say I loved what you did to that Micah fellow, quite cold hearted, though if you really wanted to punish him you should have taken him to Acherus, and let them raise him as a ghoul. That’s what I would have done, well minus the taking to Acherus part, I would have done it myself.”<br/><br/>Just who was this man, not only did demons seem to follow his every order, with zealous devotion, but now he tells me he can raise the dead, like a necromancer. His laugh is beginning to annoy me, “Child I have been alive for almost twelve thousand years, and I have studied every form of magic known on Azeroth, and mastered them, I am a sorceror of the highest caliber, and I have taken a great interest in you. You should feel honored to be approached by a member of the Moonfury family, once a well respected noble family of Zin’Azshari, but my brother saw to the dismantling of our house, so the Moonfurys are no more. Now I am Iliisadel Shadowfury, and I want you to lead my hordes in battle,” the man was mad, and the look I gave him after his speech conveyed as much. He chuckled, “Well not you, you, the other you, the darker you, yes he is just what I need to lead my minions into battle, to slaughter, to destroy, to sow chaos you shall be my greatest weapon.”<br/><br/>I had heard enough, and I charged forward, Illisadel absently sent a wave of pure death at me, but I easily dived out of it’s path, and continued my charge. He was unarmed, so as soon as I got in range it was over, but as I neared he smiled, and as I cut, my sword clanged against something solid. Looking on in horror I witnessed a sword appear in his hand, seemingly out of thin air, I quickly jumped back as he brought the word up in an upward slice, not only was he a sorceror, but he could fight hand to hand as well. It was obvious to me that I was outmatched, even if I hadn’t been exhausted from my earlier fights, there was no way I could compete with this man, but I had no choice, if I turned, and tried to flee, I had no doubt he would catch me<br/><br/>(2/4)

Illisadel held out his other hand, still smiling, and another weapon appeared this time a staff, and by the way he handled it I had no doubt he could use it in conjunction with his sword perfectly. Still I had to do something, I had to find a way to escape, but he didn’t give me time to think, as he blinked forward, and appeared right in front of me, I barely parried his sword, but the staff caught me in the stomach. He must have enhanced demonic strength, because the force of the blow, I could tell cracked a few ribs. On he came every attack he connected again with his staff, the battle lasted only a few moments before I was on my knees, with him laughing over me.<br/><br/>“Foolish boy, did you really think you stood a chance like you are now, now if you let that darker part of you out, you may be able to stand a chance, but I must say I am impressed, that you have kept it under control this long. Apparently those monk’s techniques are more formidable than I thought, it’s obvious beating you up will not bring you dark side out, but I think I know what wiiiiiill.” I looked up at him blood almost completely covering my face, but my eyes still showed defiance, and he laughed at it, “Oh, you can look at me like that all you want, but I know the one thing that will bring your darkness forward, tell me how is your sister doing, or better yet how is your good friend Fynnariel?” My blood froze, and I screamed at him, “Leave them out of this, this is between you and me!” He laughed that cackle that now makes my blood run cold, “Oh, but it’s so much more fun bringing in those you care about, it gives you an incentive, still after I slaughter your Fellowship, I wonder what I should do with them. Hmm, oh I know maybe I can give them to my succubus to play with, don’t like that idea huh, sorry Zara, oh, oh I know maybe I will just kill them and raise them as my own personal undead servants, how does that sound?”<br/><br/>I stared daggers at him, “No good either huh, oh wait I know, maybe I will corrupt your sister, and turn her into a true warlock, and as her final test I will have her kill Fynnariel, yes, yes that is perfect.” I could feel my rage building as he made his threats, and he could see it to, “You are close to losing it, good, just a little more, and I think I know the two perfect subjects to threaten, to push you over the edge.” My eyes widened in horror, and my eyes pleaded with him to not threaten who I knew he was going to threaten, once again he laughed, “He he he he he HA HA HA HA HA! Now that look is priceless, yes you seem to be in quite a pickle with two particular women, you sly dog, I must admit it’s impressive to get two such lovely ladies competing for your attentions. Still I feel that those emotions of love, and caring are holding you back, so I think the best course of action should be to remove the problem, or problems as it were. Still they are too pretty to just kill, oh I know I will have my succubus break their will, break their minds, until they are nothing more than mindless puppets, that will serve my every whim, then at least you won’t have to worry about them competing for you anymore.” <br/><br/>He laughs madly, but I barely hear it, all I saw was red, and it wasn’t from the blood, I roared out, and charged, I felt nothing, not even the strain such a burst of speed put on my muscles, vaguely I think I hear some of the tendons tear, but I felt nothing. Illisadel’s surprise at my sudden charge satisfied me, and the speed, and precision of my strikes, put him fully on the defensive, but even he could not last long against my onslaught, I swept his legs out from under him, and pointed my sword in his face. He smiled, “Do it, complete your journey into the darkness, don’t just stand there do it!” I raised my sword to do just that, but before I could complete my attack, a white streak of fur collided into me, and pinned me to the ground.<br/><br/>(3/4)

Everything is a blur, but I could faintly hear someone calling my name, finally a blow to my face snapped me out of my rage, and everything cleared there pinning me to the ground was Master Stormfury. Seeing I was myself again he got off, and I sat up, horror, and shock clear on my face, the thought of what I had almost done, I couldn’t stop them, tears poured down my face, and I started to collapse, someone caught me, and looking up I saw the kal’dorei girl from my first meeting with Master Storm fury ,who looked at me with displeasure then, but now I only saw compassion.<br/><br/>That look was the last thing I remember, when I woke up, I was back in Warsong Hold, covered in bandages, when I asked what happened no one could tell me, they had just found me laying outside half dead. I knew instinctively that Master Stormfury had brought me back here, I didn’t even get a chance to thank him for keeping me from almost killing a man in cold blood, the fight was over, and yet all I could think about was killing Illisadel. I told the people at Warsong, I wanted to be returned to Silvermoon, and I am on my way back there even as I pen this, and I can’t help but wonder if this is the last I will hear from Illisadel Shadowfury, and I know if he does go after those I care about, those I love, I know I can do nothing to protect them.<br/><br/>(4/4)

My project moves forward slowly but splendidly. We went shopping, just the two of us. And I made a simple suggestion of offering her several of my sleeping gowns. She of course refused, but I enticed her and made her see it my way.<br/><br/>The aperitif was delightful, and was just what I wanted her to taste and grow fond of. Of course I had set the bottle there several days ago, and for a few simple coins, the shop keeper was more that willing to allow it to be there. I don't think she suspected a thing.<br/><br/>When we returned to my apartment, I could see Zyss was impressed. But it was my boudoir that seemed to catch her fancy. A woman needs a place to be herself, to be a woman, and she listened to my voice raptly. I do believe the alcohol and drug was beginning to have an affect on her. I made sure to whisper soft suggestions in her ear, and touch her lightly under the pretext of seeing how any of the gowns fit her. <br/><br/>I'll admit she did look lovely, so sweet and soft, and I like how her eyes glowed from the drink, and finally seeing how lovely she was in the mirror. I want her for my own. Screw the goblin in Booty Bay, I would treat her so well she would forget that paladin of hers, and become my little concubine. Perhaps its the perfume I gave her, she smells delicious...but whatever it is, I want her. <br/><br/>And whatever I want I get.

<em> Kreindis sits down exhausted, leaning his head back on the chair in his room at the Silvermoon City Inn. The last two weeks had been spent in Pandaria - a very long two weeks without his love. Even so - Pandaria was a beautiful place. Full of life, and such... interesting inhabitants. Kreindis took a deep breath, relaxing. He was done for now, and he was at home.<br/><br/> His thoughts drifted to Zyss. Immediately, he became worried. "I've been gone for so long... I hope she didn't...." His thoughts stopped. "No... she wouldn't do that. I can trust her. Remember, Kreindis, shes not like -her-..."<br/><br/> He reached for his bag, and fished his guildstone out of it, tapping it on, and setting it down on the table next to him. "Zyss, love..? Are you there? I miss you so much, please answer." He waited patiently for her to answer. Hoping she would answer. Hoping she still loved him.</em>

The inn is progressing nicely. I have the basement and kitchen cleaned out and functional again. It actually feels great to be able to cook again in my own kitchen. Too long have I relied on the kindness of innkeepers that would allow me to use their kitchens late at night, after their guests had eaten.<br/><br/>I am fortunate that the chimneys are still in good condition and that time and the scourge haven't ravaged them as much as they could have. That is one less task that I have to worry about. The rest of the ground floor is almost done thanks to Zak's hard work. He has been helping me when he can with the clean up of the inn and I am pleasantly surprised with how much faster the work has been going when he is around.<br/><br/>Once the ground floor is finished, I will be able to start on the upstairs. My original inspections of the building revealed that the upstairs floor wasn't as badly damaged as the ground floor so I'm not expecting that to take as long. With any luck and if the Light is with me, I will be finished the clean out within a week. <br/><br/>After that, the real work begins. I have such plans for the guest house. If even a fraction of them come to be, it will become a valuable addition to the Enclave and a potential source of much needed income. But I am getting ahead of myself.<br/><br/>This morning I woke to the sound of footsteps near me. For a moment I was too dazed to place where they were coming from. A few seconds later, I worked it out. It had been late last night when Zak and I had finished eating so I had offered him a chance to stay the night. He agreed and went to find a place to sleep in one of the upstairs rooms. I stayed downstairs in the kitchen, close to the fire for warmth.<br/><br/>I could have pressed the advantage I had gained. I probably should have, but I didn't. I gave Zak the space he wanted and needed. He had told me a little of the confusion he felt, of being attracted to two women at the same time. It can't be easy for him, and I certainly didn't help matters when I tickled him. Even as I did it, I knew I was asking for trouble if he chose to respond in kind. Or worse, if he got offended and left. He did none of those things though and I was grateful that my momentary lack of control didn't push him closer to Shade.<br/><br/>I could see what she means about him looking good without a shirt though. But she was wrong. He doesn't just look good or even great shirtless, he is magnificent and the tight leather leggings he wears promise that the rest of him is just as good. I still blush at the thoughts that ran through my head last night. They even entered my dreams! Light! I haven't had dreams like that in a very long time.<br/><br/>As I watched Zak leave the old inn, heading for who knows where, I hoped that he would take my advice and talk with Shadow. The confusion he was feeling was something that he needed to sort out and even though I wanted to help him sort it out, I couldn't. Not only would I be unable to be neutral in the matter, but I was part of the problem that was causing the confusion. If only my own problems could be dealt with the same way.<br/><br/>I sit next to the dying embers of the fire in the kitchen and stare at them rather than stoke them and build the fire again so that I have hot water for the cleaning that I have to do. It's becoming painfully clear that I will have to tell Zak about my past, of how I came to be an innkeeper and a huntress and why I ran away from home.<br/><br/>My fear is that it will push him into the arms of Shade permanently. If I want to have an honest relationship with him, and not one that is built on half-truths and secrets however, it's a chance I'm going to have to take.

Blood spattered the snow and rocks North of Giants Run. Light tracks led away from the scene and disappeared into the white snow as though no one had ever been there. Farther north, a frost wolf sat vigilantly on a nearby rocky outcropping. Close by, a giant black bear paced back and forth looking restless and growling occasionally. They were protecting their companion, who sat sheltered by rocks. <br/><br/>The Huntress was hastily wrapping frostweave bandages over her right hand. The hand was badly mangled, and broken. Using her mouth and free hand she created a sling, then pulled the hand into a comfortable position with a slight moan. The medic work was not ideal, but it would have to do. Reaching into her bag she pulled out a journal, and began writing in a somewhat unreadable manner with her left hand.<br/><br/><em>The Forsaken caught me in a trap! He foresaw my plan to ambush him with Bors and Galahad. The only decent sniper position in the area was rigged with some sort of timed trap. While my pets closed in on him, the trap went off. I noticed it a second too late and my hand was crushed between rocks as a result. I was foolish. I should’ve known better than to take the easiest position available. <br/><br/>My right hand is now useless, which will make shooting my bow impossible. This leaves me with two choices. Turn to Winterhoof, or carry on. He expects that I will run and mend my wounds, so that he can get away to the Grizzly Hills. This Forsaken is wrong; I will find him and take his head with my dagger if I must! I will not lose time because of this minor set back. I.Will.Not.Fail.</em>

He came out of nowhere. <br/><br/>The rusty dust of the Barrens kicked up under his feet as he launched an attack on me from my concealed position. Had a low growl not warned me of his approach, I wouldn't have known he was there until his blades were buried deep into the chinks of my armor. Giving no order for my beast to leap from the shadows, I tucked myself into a roll and watched his blades strike into the overturned caravan, sending broken wood flying. <br/><br/>At a glance, he didn't look like anything special. A stereotypical mixture of reds and blacks with a silver lining to his armor. His blades were an inferno of darkness though I could detect a faint trace of serrated edge beneath the churning shadows. He turned his masked gaze upon me, eyes shining blue, and I knew that he wasn't playing with me. My attention shifted momentarily to his thick red hair, a dark auburn shade, and how he wore it over his shoulder. Easy to grab, I thought to myself. It's why I had kept my own hair short for so long. I grabbed my bow and he moved inward again, trying to keep me from stringing it.<br/><br/>His next strike was towards my left arm, a strike that forced me to duck to the side to avoid, but he followed through with a second blow that caught me in the side. I choked in pain and used the force of my own movement to strike him with the foreign metal of my own bow across the side of his face. He grunted, but hardly budged, as if he didn't feel the depth of being hit. He twisted the blade and ripped it through me, but I already knew now that he wasn't some upstart trying to play games with me. This Quel'dorei, I could only assume, knew well that I was picking his kin off during the war over the Barrens and was seeking revenge for his comrades.<br/><br/>I jerked away as blood began to spill, the cut was deep and I knew that I would be in danger of bleeding out rapidly if I didn't get it tended to. He had already won the fight with that one move, as he knew that I couldn't use the bow offensively and stem the flow at the same time. I swore and tried to make a run for it. But he was faster, and cut into my right arm as I turned. But I kept moving and roared a command. It was nonsensical, the word that I uttered. As if part of some made up tongue. But it had the desired effect, and a large rustic tiger leapt, his coat having allowed him to blend into the shadows of the cart well enough that he slammed into the assassin well as I reached for my bow's string and hooked it taut. I drew my first arrow and fired, striking into the man's left shoulder as he struggled with Ru trying to rip his leg off with deep claws raking through his leather armor like butter. <br/><br/>Again, he only gave a minor sound of discomfort, as if I had slapped him across the back in friendly greeting, something which made my blood run cold as he drove his blade at the animal. Golden eyes observed the movement, the flow of his body, and the muscular beast ripped free, taking chunks of flesh with him as he darted to the side. The assassin's attention returned to me as I kept retreating towards the tree line of Ashenvale, notching another arrow in case he got too close.<br/><br/>What I didn't expect was for him to nigh step out of my own shadow in the blink of an eye and drive his blades towards me again. The best I could manage was to deflect his blades by shoving my bow in their path, causing them to ricochet and slice through my skin at varying angles. Not fatal, but the cuts were tallying up. He moved as if he didn't have an arrow embedded within him and watched as I continued to move away, leaving behind a trail of blood. He began to walk at a slow, leisurely pace, his absolute calm pressing into my already straining mind, trying desperately to figure out a means in which to escape.<br/><br/>Watching him as he chased me, it was like watching a predator stalk his prey. He didn't seem to mind me anymore than a wolf would mind if a rabbit bit him during a hunt. He believed, wholeheartedly, that he held the advantage. And a part of me truly believed that he did. I had killed so many over the last weeks. An arrow to a mage's throat, a blade in a priest's spine. Assassins, once unveiled, held nothing against me. But this one had an aura about himself which unnerved me, and the fact that I had grown cocky enough to underestimate exactly what he could do lead to my downfall.<br/><br/>(1/3)

My head spun as I heard water flow, and I knew this was my only chance. Ru had kept close the entire time, stalking the man, ready to strike at my command. I barked another word, and the assassin's ears perked for the tiger's strike, but it never came. He could read my tongue already, he knew that my alien words meant something to the beast, but he didn't know what. The fact that he had picked up on it after only one blow made my stomach sick. Many didn't even figure it out until after the battle was over, they were too caught up in what they were doing. But his calm wasn't a mask, it was true and cold and calculating. He was analyzing everything and was a master of this fight.<br/><br/>Except that he didn't seem to know me well enough. I threw my bow to the ground, it wouldn't be of help at this point, and I reached for a chain full of trinkets and toys and I grabbed two. A stone and a gem, which I popped into my mouth and bit lightly. The first turned my skin ashen, even the color of my blood was stained as I threw myself into the river. I could feel his dispassionate stare as I faded into the water, the second, a gem, activating as well. I inhaled sharply and grabbed at my side with one hand as I swam, trying desperately to keep from bleeding out from the deep wound. My entire body faded into the water, I could breathe and see perfectly well, and my blood wasn't tinted in any particular cover to give it away. <br/><br/>If he had known me, he would have known that I, too, could deceive. That I enjoyed it immensely and practiced on how to use what I could do not only as a prank, but as a part of my day to day life. He wouldn't be able to follow as I swam beneath the current and remained underwater for some time, the rivers washing my wounds clean of any potential poisons. Or, so I hoped. I picked a spot that I felt would be safe, near a mountainous patch within Ashenvale, and finally pulled myself out when I couldn't breathe any longer. It was a gamble, but I prayed that he wasn't near this side of the river as I climbed out.<br/><br/>I had lost so much blood, there wouldn't be much of a telltale sign against the ground as I quickly climbed up the hillside and into the nook sheltered by a giant tree. I pulled out the stone and made sure that it was turned on. I had used it once or twice before simply to call to Zak, and I prayed now that he wasn't bedding Kye, if only because I needed someone. Desperately. To my relief, he answered and brought the bandages I had given him. At first, I tried to wrap my own wounds, but my hands were shaking. I was still slightly damp, despite the lingering enchantment which worked to help make me one with the water, and the numbness of blood loss was getting to me. He helped bind my wounds and I fell into him.<br/><br/>Resting my head on his chest, I wondered if he would have held me like he did that night in any other situation. It felt nice, he was warm as he tried to shelter me and entertained me by talking to me. Even though I was barely staying conscious, I tried to maintain a calm expression for him. Though as I began to drift, I wondered if I was asking for him to stay in my mind, or aloud. I didn't know, but as I closed my eyes, I didn't know if I would open them again. How sad, a small part of me whispered. That I would get my wish answered of watching the stars with someone else on my death bed. <br/><br/>Morning came and went, and it was by the afternoon that I finally stirred. I was surprised to find that I wasn't alone. He had stayed with me the entire time. Part of me wanted to do something stupid and rash, but I didn't let it show, simply smiling and offering my gratitude. But I didn't want to move from my position. This was my fault that I had scared the life out of him to begin with. But even if I had brought my own bandages, they would have been soaked by the swim and useless. I still needed stitches and an actual healer to cleanse any signs of infection, and I was surprised that he went as far as to offer to escort me.<br/><br/>I prayed that he hadn't seen the depths of the wounds. My confidence shaken and the fact that the assassin might still be around pushed me to decline softly, but instead, I didn't let him take his leave immediately. I stepped closer and hugged him tight, whispering my thanks to him. My lips wouldn't seek his cheek, but I buried my face into the side of his neck and sighed softly. I would have died, I realized. I had been so stupid, and I knew the strain I had put him under. My mind replayed the events of last night, and I knew that he had been highly upset by the entire ordeal. Something in his face, in his eyes, when I had managed to glance at him.<br/><br/>(2/3)

I didn't let it linger, I didn't try to make it more. I couldn't bring myself to try or suggest it, even if I hadn't been deeply wounded. Even if the bandages weren't tinted by soaking through with blood. I told him that I wanted to talk to him again, very soon. I had another secret for him as a reward for him saving me, protecting me as he had. But I told him I would leave it up to him, when he would be free next. When he would call for me, I would come and tell him. But it was also a ploy, for I needed for him to not be charged as a runaway because he had stayed with me. I needed to not cause him anymore problems. And, in that moment, I forgot all about Kye and our competition for his heart. I simply thought of Zak as I said and did what I did, my gestures less bold and more of a true affection. <br/><br/>I doubt he could tell the difference, but as I told him I would be fine and let him leave, I was already plotting my route to the nearest camp where I could find medical treatment. I would be fine, once I crept out of the enclave and found my Hawk, I was well on my way. But only one I knew he had parted. I didn't want for him to see how slow and painful my movements were. <br/><br/>It seemed I wasn't the only one who was cocky. The assassin's blades weren't poisoned. But my stomach churned, for I knew I would have died last night if they had been.<br/><br/>(3/3)

Their fighting came in a desperate whirlwind which left only one victor. I was surprised, and yet not at all shocked as I rushed to Ratheron's side and summoned the energy from within my body to pour a healing energy into him. It was meant to stabilize him as well as check for damage as Tyrael roared in outrage. I didn't quite grasp why he was so infuriated, this wasn't something that had befallen Ratheron. It was a battle to learn, to challenge and push the man, to discover secrets kept locked away. We can learn much from each other through words, but much more is revealed through combat. Things I had seen, but only Ratheron had experienced. I wondered what his answers would be when he came around.<br/><br/>That wouldn't be for some time, however. He was hurt bad, but he still breathed. He would live, and I watched how everyone reacted with great dismay. Demon roared, though I couldn't tell if it was approval or laughter. Lei was shaking her head and Shae, to my surprise, leapt from Ashok's side and came to mine. The blonde haired woman was surprisingly quick and nimble when she moved, though I had taken her as a mage or a priest. She didn't often talk about what she did, unless one counted her fascination with the ancient dig sites were historic discoveries were found. Particularly anything elven. A strange hobby for a druid, but even stranger still was how a green light pulsed from her hands, strong enough that it seemed to almost bleed through Ratheron and the grass around him seemed to become a bit greener.<br/><br/>"Don't break the elf," Demon called in rough Thalassian at Striker, as if he would understand her. The spat with Tyrael wouldn't last long, but I had to make sure that he was alright as well. These things left me with a lot to think about, but after he had been taken care of, we moved him to a more comfortable place to rest.<br/><br/>It would take weeks for him to recover fully, though I wasn't as upset as the last time we had been in this situation. Primarily because Striker wasn't going to try to kill Ratheron, or anyone of our group. He seemed to tolerate Tyrael's outburst like a parent would a spoiled child's tantrum, hardly phased by it. I am doing my best to keep Ratheron's pain to a minimum, and yet, still, life moves forward.<br/><br/>A dispute began over the stupid plague cauldron that no one had bothered to touch since Honi and uhm… that other guy who left had tried to use it as a weapon and were shot down instantly by Ratheron. Lineron, I feel, could use it to brew stronger plagues, but not let them leak everywhere, necessarily. He could contain and control it. It is his job as a Death Knight. But Ratheron will have none of it. Once again, they're fighting, and I'm getting tired of mediating everything that goes on between them.<br/><br/>They're like brothers in that annoying way where only one side can be right and they'll both be damned if it's not them. Light forbid they both decide that they want something, I can already imagine them playing tug of war and screaming "Mine!".<br/><br/>It wouldn't be a problem, except for the fact that Ratheron is the leader, and whatever he says goes. Lineron can never win points. Lineron can never be right. Rath thinks that I 'get' some way around Lin and that I can't do my own job effectively in making sure that we're all safe. I just won't volunteer anymore. <br/><br/>Beyond that, Zakia, to my surprised, asked me for help with something. I'm glad I apologized to him for letting him lead me on an assumption. It allowed him to at least believe that I could help. Unfortunately, it was something I had experience with. Love, relationships. I advised him as best as I could, but I'd never been in his situation before. So I simply told him that he has to think of this on a logical note, not emotionally. Who is the best mate is not determined by how much you want to… to…<br/><br/>It's by trust, how you complement each other, what you need in your life and what you can give them. What matches best.

<em>Shadow read over the last line in her journal and waited until daybreak across Azeroth, waited until she knew that most everyone would be awake, including Lineron and Ratheron. She picked up her stone, not caring if Striker was listening again, or Ares.</em><br/><br/><strong>"We are the Fellowship. We are the hope of the Rising Sun. We are friends and family, and we do not always get along. I will not ask for everyone to get along, I want for you to have your opinions and argue and cry into your pillow at night. But wake up each day with a fresh start, a smile, and look at your friends and family around you, and please. Be thankful. Please, don't forget the Founding of New Dawn and those who were injured and what we've been forced to endure. Please, consider your words carefully, they're impacting us too much of late. This animosity doesn't need to exist if we communicate. <br/><br/>I love all of you."</strong><br/><br/><em>Shadow set her guild stone down and closed her eyes. It was the only thing she could think of. Last night's spitting at Zakia hadn't gone unnoticed. The tension in Lin hadn't gone unnoticed. And she wondered, sadly, if people were forgetting what was important. She would repeat the words twice more that day. Once well into the afternoon, and once more during evening. Everyone needed the reminder. They were scaring her.</em>
