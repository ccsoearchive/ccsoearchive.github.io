The trout was just about to grab her bait as the guildstone crackled to life. Jana cursed softly under her breath as she tried to tease it back with a few casual flicks of the line. How could a fish hear the voices? It was pointless as the trout lazily moved upstream away from Jana.<br/><br/>Reeling in the baited hook, Jana set down her pole and picked up the guildstone. "Good morning Shadow. You do realize that each individual will hear this and react in their own way? How is Ratheron, by the way? Are we still searching for Elysium? I do hope we find him soon."<br/><br/>The subtle stirring beside Jana materialized into her golden cat. He settled beside her and began licking his chops and then his paws. The self satisfied look on his cat face was testament to the fishy odor coming from him as he purred. Jana looked at the cat and shook her head. "Just because it's easy for you to swipe your paw into the water and grab yourself a fish does not make you a better fisherman!" she grumbled.

<em> From the Journal of Zakia Sunblade</em><br/><br/><strong> Friday</strong><br/><br/>Frustration, helplessness, worthlessness, these are my main emotions right now, all of it caused by one man, Illisadel Shadowfury. I am frustrated because everyone in the Fellowship won't let the matter drop, I guess I should feel fortunate that they care about me enough to want to kill the man. Still the fact that even Ratheron, and his family are even offering their help, aggravates me, they are the last people's help I want, I would rather ask Lineron, and his crazy family for help than the Firehawks. Damn it, why did Master Storfury, have to send that letter to Rhannah, I was laying low, until I recovered, I didn't want to make everyone worry, but that damned feline took it upon himself to inform Rhannah. She in turn informed the whole guild, when she asked Shade, and Kye over the guildstone to come talk some sense into me, needless to say I was bombarded with questions after that.<br/><br/>Which was exactly the reason I didn't want anyone to know, if it had just been Kye, and Shade, I would have been happy to know they cared, and I must admit the thought, of both of them nursing me back to health was a pleasant one. That is not to be however, for now I sit here in the Spire's infirmary, with medical personnel coming in, and out to check on me, I am about to throw a dagger into the wall to scare them off. I don't need any of the Firehawks people checking in on me, it was bad enough I was forced to accept the help, of their new... acquaintance, I guess you might call him. This Striker fellow, has a lot of strange toys, including talking armor, of course I have heard stories of something called an A.I. found in Titan ruins, and from what I have heard they seem similar to to this man's armor, just on a larger scale.<br/><br/>I am not so proud, that I was above saying thank you to the man for his help, I wasn't really worried about myself, but Shade seemed worse than I had originally thought, but with his help I think she will be back on her feet before me.<br/><br/>How helpless, and worthless I feel as well, I can barely move, if I were attacked like this I would surely be killed, and I am not used to such situations. I write this late at night because I cannot sleep, every time I close my eyes I am plagued by nightmares, of Illisadel torturing the people I love. Most of the nightmares involve Kye, and Shade, which doesn't surprise me anymore, they have taken up a bigger place in my heart than even Rhannah. Being forced to watch as Illisadel tortures them, or any other number of horrific things in my mind, and unable to do anything, that is the focus of the nightmares, and I know it is true, if Illisadel came for them, despite my bravado to Kye, I know I could do nothing to stop him. Am I really so useless, that I can't even protect the people I love, I feel my eyes getting heavy, but I cannot sleep, sleep brings the nightmares, and the nightmares brings back my feelings of helplessness, no I will not sleep, this night, nor perhaps for many nights afterward.

Fyn, who says she was like Zak, said that two men chasing her would make her pull away from both.<br/><br/>Kye wanted for me to have my chance.<br/><br/>Zak remained silent all the while, never encouraging me or telling me to stop. Indifferent. Ignoring me.<br/><br/>Striker, the rotten bastard, turned out to not be so rotten at the core. Though I mocked him and tried to pick fights with him to distract myself from the pain, he remained patient. He even talked me through what I had already figured. <br/><br/>Kye is much farther along in her path than I. She has recovered. She is ready to move on with her life. She can offer him things that I can't. She can be there for him in ways that I can't. If he picked me, it wouldn't be fair to anyone. I can't give him what he needs. <br/><br/>I would only hold him back. <br/><br/>I would only hurt him.<br/><br/>But I need to talk to him. I need to let him know why I have changed my path. Because once I had started something, I didn't want to stop. Because I had started with him first I didn't want for Kye's decision to also chase him affect our relationship.<br/><br/>But there is nothing there. He gives me nothing and anything I could give is inferior to Kye. I want to be able to give something good. Something solid. Everything I've offered, save a shirt and some wraps, have gone ignored in the long run.<br/><br/>At least I helped him. At least I got to know her. <br/><br/>At least they might still be my friends after I talk to them both. <br/><br/>Fel, it hurts. I want to be able to be so much, to give something. To be a part of something. To have someone here with me. <br/><br/>Especially now. Something scary happened. I don't know what'll happen anymore.<br/><br/>I'm scared to sleep… I'm even more afraid to ask for someone to stay with me.

<em>She had heard, she had little enough to do besides listen these days as it was. The twins were growing well, and in three months, life would change yet again...</em><br/><br/><strong>Kel'tira Sunblaze</strong><br/><br/>The quiet here is nice, but at the same time, the rains of Krasarang and the cool breezes are lonely. I spent today in and around the House in Silvermoon, being visible, being present.<br/><br/>It is nice to sit in my own study again, letting the memories wash over me as they are want to do. I miss the Fellowship, the people that, from what I can gather over the guildstones, seem to be tearing themselves apart. I miss Shadow, and all the others. But especially her, and her incorrigible humor. The lighthearted, yet sometimes serious, friend that I have found.<br/><br/>And Auxi, but there is worry that goes along with Auxilia's name in my mind. She lost Sol, and while she's taking that better than I ever did when I lost Nic...? I can't stand to see her alone, and she is alone.<br/><br/>Life is a strange thing.<br/><br/>I met Shade today, we shared tea and scones and interesting conversation. The Firehawk infirmary was home to a Human, as well as Zackia. Shade and I talked about... most everything, quite honestly. It was nice to just sit and talk with someone else. Make a new friend.<br/><br/>And now I feel one of the twins kicking, it is time to seek out food once again. I've eaten more than I ever have before in the past six months.<br/><br/>Three to go...

North of Giants Run, the Howling Fjord:<br/><br/>The wind howled freezing the air and chilling the bone. Wind was the only sound that could be heard in this place. Fynnariel could smell him though…the Forsaken. Rot and decay waited upwind. The man was headed towards the Grizzly Hills pass, and Fyn had left a little surprise for him there. Snow crunched under foot, the wind drowned out the noise. Just a little further…<br/><br/>Between worgs, yeti, elementals, Alliance and Vyrkul, the huntress’s patience had grown thin. Of course the events of the past few days within the Fellowship did not help her mood. Everyone Fyn worried about, Zak and Lineron and this Striker fellow…all of it she pushed to the back of her mind.<br/><br/>The hand that had been injured in the last confrontation had been healed by a young Sin’dorei by the name of Linthsong. It gripped her bow tightly as though no break had ever transpired. Fynnariel was ready to face this unknown man.<br/><br/>“You set this trap just for me?” The Forsaken was giggling manically and staring at the rubble that blocked his path. It appeared as though a landslide had occurred, with the help of a few explosive traps. The huntress had succeeded in blocking his route. “Coming for me with a fury like hell hath no?” His laughter was high in pitch and sickening. “Retribution for damaging your hand? A Farstrider should know better.” He made a ‘tut tut’ sound. <br/><br/>Fynnariel stopped, leaving a few feet between her and the Undead man. Bors and Galahad were on either side of her and by an unspoken command the two fanned out slowly advancing on the Forsaken. The Ranger pointed her bow at the enemy; this wasn’t about rage or pay back. This was about getting the job done. “You took something that does not belong to you.”<br/><br/>The man’s eyes were cold, and glinted with malice. “Everyone takes what does not belong to them.” He placed the jewel adorned box on the ground at his feet and removed what looked to be a walking stick off his back. “Did Anselm ever tell you my name woman?” Fyn did not respond. “I am Wilhelm. Wilhelm Morne.” He began pacing back and forth still giggling and making incoherent sounds. “I guess an Elf like you would not know that name….but I was once a great battle mage when I was living…who dabbled in trap making and explosives…” The latter he said as almost an after thought. He stopped pacing and the air began to crackle as though it was charged. “Go back to the pretty parlours and spires of Silvermoon girl. Death awaits you if you face me.”<br/><br/>The Ranger stared him down, bow raised. She felt a tingle run down her spine, a mixture of fear an excitement. What took place next would happen in only a matter of minutes.<br/><br/>((1/3))

Wilhelm dropped low to the ground; ice spread from where his hands touched the frozen landscape. Large spears of sharpened ice shot up out of the ground causing the three to dodge. Bors roared in fury and was forced back along the mountain side of the pass, blocked from combat with a wall of jagged ice. Galahad nearly fell of the edge of the cliff in attempt to escape being skewered, the wolf recovered quickly and ran at the mage. At that same moment Fynnariel dove to the side, she felt the ice scrap against her mail. She narrowly missed falling off the cliffs edge. While in motion she shot off several arrows hoping to silence Wilhelm. He incinerated then with a fire blast, and stopped one with his staff.<br/><br/>Mirror images of the mage appeared, all giggling with that same maniacal pitch. <em>Damn him…</em>Fynnariel had silenced the wrong copy; it ran at her and she put an arrow through its eye socket. Galahad tackled another to the ground, ripping and snarling, trying to grab his throat. Bors, still trapped behind an ice wall, threw his entire body weight at it all the while roaring in frustration.<br/><br/>An icebolt caught Fynnariel in the chest, she dropped to her knee. The affects of the spell made it difficult for her to move. Wilhelm had already summoned a water elemental, the Mage was much faster than she. Galahad now finished with the copy; his white fur matted with his own blood, howled in fury and attacked the elemental. <em>So this is plan…to keep me distracted and move in for the kill….</em><br/><br/>“I will finish you slowly…” Wilhelm smiled evilly and the Blizzard came. Ice fell from the sky pounding Fyn, cutting her skin, breaking through her mail. It pinned her down; unable to get off shots or disengage she took the pain with a look of defiance. <br/><br/>Bors crashed through the ice wall in a mass of fur and blood. The giant bear knocked over the mage and charged at the Elemental. Wolf and bear, soaked in blood and water, attempted to tear the creature to pieces. Fynnariel seeing her chance went for the jewel adorned box. Wilhelm rose to his feet with a roar of rage and unleashed a cone of cold. Fyn rolled to the side and let loose a barrage of arrows. Two hit the Forsaken in the chest and just as she released the third arrow he pressed a device in his hand. The last arrow struck him between the eyes, but it was too late Wilhelm’s last trap had gone off.<br/>((2/3))

Explosions riddled the pass, fire rock and snow poured down the mountain side. Fynnariel froze when the explosions went off, something inside her turned off. For a brief moment she forgot where she was…in that moment she thought she was fighting back in Quel’Danas. Then the snow hit her, jarring her back into the present. <br/><br/>Waves of rock and snow washed Wilhelm’s corpse over the cliffs, and in her moment of hesitation took Fynnariel along with it. Rock and tree battered her body, but eventually she came to a stop. The avalanche had deposited her on an overhang. The huntress struggled to maintain consciousness but failed…<br/><br/>Fynnariel regained consciousness with a start; the Ranger carefully took in her surroundings. She was sitting on a small ledge the pass high above her. Below her the cold ocean churned against jagged rocks. Somehow the jewelled box was sitting next to her. An attempt to move proved futile. Pain rattled Fyn’s body and she began to take stock of her injuries. <em>One broken left leg, numerous abrasions and bruises, possibly broken ribs and a dislocated shoulder. Also if left untended these cuts from the battle will likely become infected... </em><br/><br/>Fynnariel was going to have to call for help; with some effort she reached into her pocket to grab her guildstone. The wind almost blew it out of her hands. She remembered Shadows message on the guildstone earlier and knew what she had to do. Swallowing the shame and embarrassment she clicked it on. <br/><br/>“Uh…hello?” Her voice sounded distant, the wind almost over taking it. “Is anyone…on here?”<br/><br/>((3/3))

Oh boy. Life has become more complicated and yet more wonderful at the same time. Zak loves me! Me! The best part is that he not only doesn't care that I was a streetwalker when I was younger, but he wanted to track down every john that had mistreated me and give them payback. I managed to convince him that it wasn't worth it. Those men would get what they deserved through the whims of fate. Zak didn't have to put his own life in danger to get justice for me.<br/><br/>What was he thinking? Trying to leave the infirmary the day after major surgery? Zak had been ambushed by a powerful sorcerer that left him almost dead. He wasn't listening to his sister about seeking treatment, so she called over the guildstone for me and Shade to talk some sense into him. Shade and I raced to find him. As I travelled, I could hear the fellowship talking over the guildstone. I had to grin, Zak was not going to like that. He has a tendency to keep to himself and to have others want to help him would be difficult for him to accept. <br/><br/>Shade had beat me to finding Zak, but when I got there, I could see that she was in bad shape as well. It was decided to take the both of them to Firehawk Spire for treatment. Rhannah went on ahead to warn the infirmary that they would be coming, leaving me to get them there. Given that they both were in bad shape, I had to call out for help over the guildstone. <br/><br/>Imagine my surprise when Lord Firehawk himself answered me. He appeared moments later and would not take no for an answer. Zak allowed himself to be taken to the Spire for treatment and I followed with Shade a few moments later. <br/><br/>While they were being treated, I couldn't stay in the room. I had to get out of the Spire and control my fears. Seeing Zak and Shade so badly beaten up brought back a lot of bad memories of times I has dragged friends to the free clinic after a john had gotten nasty. Their treatment went well though and I was allowed in to see them both. It was hard to see them like that. I often wished I had healing skills, and that time was one of those times. <br/><br/>Zak was tired so I left to do a few errands. I couldn't help sneaking back though to check on them both. Shade was still awake and we talked for a while about a lot of things, but trust was a big part of our talk that night. I had to get tough on her to get her to trust me enough to help change her bandages.<br/><br/>I told her about my seer friend that helped me get on the track of getting my life back. It feels strange to say that by helping me get a place in a brothel and taking me off the streets he placed me on a path that led to me being an innkeeper and on to the fellowship. But that's what he did. By helping me get into a brothel, away from the constant struggle to survive, he helped me. For the first time since I ran away from home, I didn't have to worry about whether I would find enough to eat. I didn't have to worry about where I was going to sleep or how I was going to stay warm. <br/><br/>I was able to clean myself up and because I wasn't spending half my day looking out for my basic needs I had time to learn skills that didn't rely on my ability to please men. I served drinks and food in the bar while I was between clients. The madam even allowed me to learn about the business side of the operation. When she decided to go straight and leave the escort business behind, I took over. A few years after that, the last girl decided to get out of the game and our little brothel became a tavern with me as the innkeeper. <br/><br/>All through that time, my seer friend visited me, encouraging me to dream, to reach for where I wanted to be and to become the person I was meant to be. It still saddens me that the only person who saw beyond the dirt, beyond the streetwalker, beyond the distrust and anger, is gone. He died in his sleep three months after I turned the brothel into a tavern. I miss his wise counsel, his acceptance and his friendship. I miss him more than I miss my real father. I just hope that wherever he is now, that he is proud of the person I have become.<br/><br/>Perhaps that is why I want to be Shade's friend. I can see myself in her. She is where I was the day the seer found me. I hope I can help her become the person she was meant to be. With the help of the fellowship I might have a chance at succeeding. Or at least I did have.<br/><br/>The way of the world is that nothing stays the same, everything changes and I am not exempted from that. Zak loves me and I should be delirious with joy, but I can't help but be afraid that when she finds out, Shade will turn from me and the fellowship. If that happens I fear that no one will be able to reach her again. At least there is one thing that might help prevent that. I never tried to stop her seeing Zak or get in the way of her chasing him. Perhaps that will be enough, I don't know. Only time will tell.

<em> From the Journal of Zakia Sunblade</em><br/><br/><strong> Saturday</strong><br/><br/>Another night of little sleep, I had hooped the nightmares would fade after a few days time, but it seems I was wrong. Though they have changed, whereas before they showed me visions of Shade, Fyn, Rhan, and Kye all being horribly tortured, now I only see Kye. If not for these fel damned dreams, I would be drunk with happiness, I finally confessed my love for Kye. I admit I think I always knew deep in my heart that she was the right one, but my own stupidity kept me from seeing it. I also admit, I felt I didn't deserve her, even after she told me of her past as a streetwalker, somewhere in my heart I felt I didn't deserve a woman like her, and I feared that she would not return my feelings. <br/><br/>It was a foolish worry, for as I said the words, "I love you," I could see her eyes brighten with joy, and needless to say, she told me she loved me as well. How my heart skipped for joy, it had been my first moment of true happiness in the last few days, still because of my love I wanted to hunt down the men who had hurt her, but she convinced me they were not worth my time, and were beneath me. Thay may be, but I swear if she ever sees one of those men on the street, he will not live long, I know I do not have to prove my love to her, by killing all the men who had mistreated her. Still my sense of justice demands they pay, and if she ever points one of them out, pay he will.<br/><br/>Still with as happy as I was, I thought I could lay down, and sleep, and dream of nothing, but our future together. Fate it seems had other plans, for as soon as I closed my eyes the nightmares started, now with only Kye the focus of the torment. It seems my nightmares have only adapted to my new found love, and is using her to terrorize me, damn that Illisadel he is the cause of these nightmares. I can't continue like this, perhaps I will talk to Kye about it the next chance I get, perhaps she will know of way to help me, because at this rate, even after I am healed I will be too exauhsted to move.

We've been granted private rooms, and privacy was something I needed after tonight. But I'm not alone. Half wish I was. But Striker, who has been taking care of us, joined me. He helped set my armor up in my room and Kye went with Zak. The two of them alone... My stomach turns with jealousy. But I tried so hard to not think about it. Striker sat with me, and rubbed my back as I wept. Held me as I tried to hit him. And then laid with me as he told me a story about what had happened in his own life. <br/><br/>I don't know what to think anymore. For he told me many a flattering thing, all words which fell upon deaf ears. I told him that he, too, should find someone to love one day. I'm not the only one who deserves happiness. I didn't know why he stared at me the way that he did after that. Perhaps because I had told him I have probably been alone for as long as he's been alive. At least, I thought as much at first. <br/><br/>Until he kissed me.<br/><br/>It wasn't like the last time, before I had confessed my abandonment of the chase. For I had told Striker that, as far as I can remember, I've never been kissed, or have kissed anyone. And he did it to give me a memory of it. Though it wasn't unpleasant, he is a human, I don't know what he expects, considering I spent a good chunk of time ridiculing and mocking him even as he helped us.<br/><br/>I didn't know how to react, my cheeks were still wet with tears, my heart hurt, and my stomach rebelled. But still, he looked at me. Still, he seemed almost as uncertain as I was, though it was all I could do to not pull away as he did it a third time, though far more brief.<br/><br/>I turned away, until I decided that I didn't quite want to be alone. It would be better to give him a reason to stay, for I feared loosing this friendship as well as my chance at love, today. I've lost enough. My lips found his neck, but he simply settled with me, told me to sleep. I shudder at what I've done. I don't know what I'm doing, but tonight will be another sleepless night for me.<br/><br/>I can't say the words, but he seems to know that I would give anything to have someone stay with me. At least he isn't wearing his armor tonight. He did last night, and my neck was stiff when I finally woke.<br/><br/>I do not love him, I feel nothing but pain and sickness. These memories aren't very pleasant, but at least they're memories. Should I be grateful or push him out of my room?<br/><br/>I'm trapped.

<em> From the Journal of Zakia Sunblade</em><br/><br/><strong>Sunday</strong><br/><br/>My heart hurts, and the shame I feel only exacerbates the pain, do not misunderstand, I do not regret my decision in choosing Kye. Still I know I hurt Shade, and I am ashamed of myself, looking back she tried everything to make me look only at her, but I just couldn't see it for what it was then. She hates me I know she does, and who can blame her, I broke her heart, something she did not deserve, but what was I to do my heart was split between two women. The choice was impossible to make without someone getting hurt, maybe I should have at least responded to Shade's feelings, but my mind could not comprehend the possibility that someone could ever love me as a man. Not as a friend, not as a brother, but as a man, I did not think I deserved to have such a thing, a woman who would stay by my side no matter what.<br/><br/>I know in my heart I still love Shade, just not in the way she wanted, I love her as a sister, and frankly I am not sure we would have been good together anyway. We both are too secretive, and that is no way to begin a relationship, Kye told me everything about her past, something that she was afraid would drive me away, she bared her soul to me, and I did the same to her. Yes, Shade, and I would have only ended up hurting each other, it is what I have to believe, for if I don't then there will always be that what if. As I told Kye I do not want our relationship to be based off of what ifs, what if I had chosen differently, what if I hadn't chosen at all. I will not dwell on those things, my life is filled with too many what ifs, so many that if I dwelled on them all I would go insane, no it is better to push the what ifs out of your mind, and focus on the future.<br/><br/>As I look beside me, I smile at the sleeping form of the woman I love, she stayed with me last night, nothing untoward happened, but I needed her to stay, I needed her prescence, I bleieved to chase away the nightmares. For the first time in days, I slept, I rested, no nightmares plaguing me, all I needed was the prescence of the one I loved. It is why I want to move out of the spire, and into the guest house, I cannot ask her to stay with me every night, nor am I sure the staff at the spire would allow her to. I feel trapped in this place, I feel as though I am in a jail cell rather than a luxurious private room, I can't bear to be here anymore, for I know when Kye is gone the nightmares will return. I hope beyond hope that she can convince Striker to let me move, because I would sooner cut off my brace, and sneak out of this place, than to remain one more moment here. There is too much pain here, knowing Shade is just a few doors away, and I am sure she would prefer me to be gone from the spire as well. There is only a few more hours until dawn, and I want to lay down next to the woman I love, and get some more sleep, she is my everything, and I will die before I let those nightmares come true.

Dear Journal,<br/><br/>I cannot believe Wyn would try something so dispicable as to steal my attention and love from my handsome paladin. Did she forget what I am? Who I am? Well, she won't forget for a very long time now. Silly mage, warlocks eat -you- for breakfast!<br/><br/>One of my many strengths is my willpower. I must constantly be exerting my willpower over those that I have defeated and call upon for aid. Demons are tricky and subtle, much more subtle than Wyn will ever hope to be. Tsk, tsk, tsk...she didn't recognize that I too am an enchantress, and checked and nullified her simple feeble attempts to take control of my emotions.<br/><br/>Now I am the mistress, and she is the slave. I turned the tables on her, and she only knows love and devotion for me. Oh, and the pain of my dear succubi's lash. Yes, I will free her eventually, when I tire of her, but for now...it is good to have a powerful mage under my sway. Besides, she will keep me entertained while Kreindis is in Pandaria, very well entertained.<br/><br/>Krei, I long for your embrace and warm loving kisses. I work diligently to join you to fight by yourside, and to hold you close each evening. Please, beloved, come back to me safe and sound.

I was mistaken to believe she was as naive and innocent as I thought. And that proved to be my downfall. I also underestimated the love she shares with the paladin, Kreindis.<br/><br/>It was early morning, I had only been asleep a very short time, and my mind was still in a sleepy fog when I answered the door to Zyss' plaintive plea to let her in. I wasn't worried, nor was I really aware when she came in, however she didn't come alone. <br/><br/>Before I could react her succubus had my hands clamped in a vise like grip behind me, and Zyss had placed a well scented cloth in my mouth. And then my indoctrination began. She stripped me, my mind and my soul of everything. And now I am her's to do with as she pleases.<br/><br/>I suppose I owe her a debt for not having me simply killed, and I am allowed to be myself, more or less. However, I cannot harm her, nor seek a way to come out from whatever she has done to me. I actually find this very exciting, and find the subjugation delightful. I wonder if this is part of her plan, nor do I care. The subliminal orders are hidden in the lashes of the succubus' whip, and in the sublime treatment she gives me. <br/><br/>She satifies all my needs, and I will serve her willingly. I find myself craving her praises, and touch. She is a gentle mistress. And I think I love her more than I did before.<br/><br/><em>Note: I have allowed her to write this in her journal. I think it will imprint the orders I have given to her, and she will find herself more inclined to yearn for my attentions and my voice. I am not a cruel person, but she will be submissive towards me for quite some time, as payment for what she had planned for me - Zyss </em>

I cried. <br/><br/>I never cry, happy moments or sad. Not when the Farstriders found me in the woods as a child. Not when my tactical unit was destroyed by the Scourge. Not even in my deepest moments of despair or guilt. Not one single tear has been shed. Until that moment, that moment I realised there is one person I would do anything for. One person whose well being means everything in the world to me, whose love is everything…<br/><br/>Carinoth. He used the Light to heal me. I know how he despises it for not being there when he needed it the most. I begged him not to do it. Broken, bleeding and lying on a cliffs edge, I begged him to not worry. I promised him that the wounds would heal with time. He didn’t listen. Pain tore through my heart watching him concentrate, feeling the Light run through me and mend my broken bones. The effort it took him was immense, and it made me ache for him. I never truly realised how much I cared for him until that moment. Knowing what it was costing him to do this I again pleaded with him to stop…and much to my relief he did. Carinoth claimed it only gave him a headache. Headache or no, I threw myself into his arms content to stay there forever to stay with him forever.<br/><br/>But a cliff’s overhang is not exactly a safe place, or comfortable. Carinoth and Nethers took me to Camp Oneqwah so I could rest. Bors and Galahad were no where to be found. Drained from the effort it took to heal me, Carinoth still went looking for them. Bors he found near where we battled the mage, in good spirits and happy. Galahad he found at Camp Winterhoof, wounded and well…stoic as ever. They both made it back to me alive. Words can’t even begin to express the emotions I felt in that moment, the relief, the love…it was all so…so very exhausting.<br/><br/>Carinoth left me to rest. I slept for a time then returned to Vengence Landing too finish my orders and hand in the box. I am glad Carinoth was not there when High Executor Anselm opened the jewel adorned box. My blood still boils with rage to think of it. All that trouble, all that time, energy and emotion spent on a teddy bear. Yes a teddy bear! A family heirloom Anselm said. My commanders have my report and I cannot imagine they will be pleased. Farstriders being used for petty errands? Ha!<br/><br/>Unsurprisingly I have been put on leave for a time. I took a brief stop at House Firehawk, I heard they had an infirmary and thought it might be useful for my wolf. There Zakia was still recovering with Shade. Kye and Kel were there also. That stranger was there too. I let him look at my wounds. He uses gadgets of all sorts; to be honest it made me uncomfortable. Striker seemed impressed that the light could heal so much damage. He gave me some sort of painkiller. After that things get a little…fuzzy.<br/><br/>From what I remember: Striker has many weapons…he may have said he would make a gun for me…and I think I may have called him bulky. I’m also fairly certain Zak ended things with Shade….or maybe she ended things with him? I think the human may be carrying a torch for Shade. But fel, what do I know? Anyway, things get a little mixed after that. I awoke in a tree in the court yard today. I slept for an entire day then escaped to the beach. I needed to get away. That minor painkiller Striker gave me awoke a hunger inside of me that I need time to quiet…

Kyetah stirred in her sleep, her arm sliding over the person beside her. She woke fully, looking into the sleeping face of the man she loved. Even though he couldn't see it in his dreams, she smiled as she brushed the hair from his eyes and placed a small kiss on his forehead. She stretched her legs, stiff from being in the one position for most of the night, and climbed out of the bed.<br/><br/>The pre dawn light shone through the window as she moved about the room. She dressed quickly, choosing her regular clothes instead of her armour and hurried out into the street. A sharp whistle brought her riding tiger to her side. She climbed on its back and pointed it towards the city gate, stopping only to by a bunch of wildflowers and a single white lily. These were placed in her saddle bags as she continued on her way.<br/><br/>A short time later, she stopped at a small graveyard next to the wall surrounding Falconwing Square. Her tiger was tied to a post and she made her way to a corner of the graveyard containing two simple graves. One grave was the size of a boy that had almost reached adulthood, the other was only slightly longer than her arm in length.<br/><br/>She placed the wildflowers on the larger grave and laid the lily on the smaller one. She stood slowly, resting her hand affectionately on the gravestone of the smaller grave and brushed a single, solitary tear from her eye. “I can't stay, but I promise, I'll come back later and tell you both about what's going on in my life.”<br/><br/>She untied the tiger and climbed on its back, hurrying back to the Spire and hoping that she wasn't gone long enough for her to be missed.

The past few days have been the strangest that they've ever been in my life. Though, to be fair, I never appreciated just how odd my life was until I began to think about it. The more I think about it, the more my mind and the world around me seems to unravel. But the fine print remains ever the same.<br/><br/>I am meant to be alone.<br/><br/>I think I told Kye what it was that one night that we had gone to the bar, when I had gotten drunk, when this had all started coming together. It is my destiny, though I do not know why. I think I am beginning to realize things. Faults. Gaps.<br/><br/>Sometimes, I do not know what is a memory and what is a dream. What life I have led, what is just an illusion. <br/><br/>I know I've seen this man's face before. The one who attacked me lurked within the Spire only a couple of days ago, and I tortured my mind trying to find out when and where. But the deeper I dove, the more I questioned if I really had ever seen him before.<br/><br/>I know it was me. I know it was my memory. But I cannot grasp it.<br/><br/>I cannot grasp the memory of my first kiss.<br/><br/>Of being kissed.<br/><br/>Where have all of these early memories of my life gone? Why have I never questioned this before? The more I think about it, the worse it gets. My head spins, I feel sick, like I'm unraveling. If I found the answer, I think I would lose my sanity. <br/><br/>Striker... does not help. He has dedicated himself to my recovery. Full time. He has chosen to leave me alone, for now at least, in other aspects, and things seem to go back to the way that is best between us. A fierce exchange of snappy, biting comments and deranged humor that only two people who have rolled around in death and blood and corpses can appreciate.<br/><br/>Don't believe me? I think I've inspired him to create a statue garden of those he has slain, bleeding real blood from their wounds. <br/><br/>Though I am quickly regaining my strength and recovering from the blood loss, I haven't seen Zak since I had confronted him that night. Nor Kye, when she helped me to my room. I've screamed, I've cried, I've tried to beat the life out of pillows and the ever patient Striker. Slowly, the wound in my heart grows numb, but I am still all too aware of it.<br/><br/>Particularly because my companion has begun to talk about relationships. He thinks I should have one, but I don't think we see eye to eye exactly. I don't think he realizes that all I really want from a relationship is a companion of the spirit and mind. Someone I feel I can open up to and trust. Someone I can tell my secrets to, and who can tell me their secrets. I had that with Zak, I was beginning to believe I could tell him anything and he would support me. That I could do the same.<br/><br/>That he wouldn't pressure me for more until I had learned to trust enough.<br/><br/>But it is inevitable. A man will want something more than that. Something I know I may be years away from being ready to give. Even thinking about it makes my skin crawl.<br/><br/>But, at least I am clean. At least I have a bit more space, now. At least I'm not completely alone, this time. I think tomorrow, I will try to convince Striker to leave the Spire with me. Though we would have to be careful, he would be killed as not even neutral factions are allowed within Horde capitals and the tensions are too high to risk it, I think he ought to see something.<br/><br/>He is always the one to be marveled over, who can talk about so many things that he knows for a fact about this world and the universe. I think it's about time that he saw something beyond even his grasp. <br/><br/>It will give me something to look forward to, give him something that will perhaps humble him. And it will distract me from some of the harsher truths of life.

<em>Explosions. Fire. Then it all went black.<br/><br/>Ashok woke up groggy and groaned as he rolled onto his stomach. "Son of a..." He trailed off as he saw what had happened. The Legion's End was a mess. The tables and chairs were destroyed, as was the bar. Suddenly he started to remember what had happened. They had been attacked. It had happened all so fast he didn't know what to think.<br/><br/>Silver, Shivvy and Fenris had been out on the boat finishing putting all the gear away as well as getting the rest of the men situated. He and Tai had been sitting here in the Tavern directing those that came to the ship. Alexander had joined them, deciding it would pay better to fight with them than with anyone else. It was after Alexander had walked in that it happened. Small metal contraptions were thrown in through the windows and then they were on the floor. At least Ashok was.<br/><br/>Alexander somehow kept his feet and started swinging his sword and shield around like a mad man. Tai for his part was unaffected, but the Death Knight was outnumbered. Normally not a big issue but these guys were professionals. They made it look easy, they surrounded Tai and took him down. But they didn't kill him, they left him incapacitated, a dagger stuck into the back of his neck. Ashok swore as he got up and felt himself knocked back down. He struggled but there wasn't much he could do.<br/><br/>They were talking to each other, but Ashok couldn't make out the language. It sounded gutteral and made his skin crawl. But that was all he got before he saw them lugging the case out. He started to get up again but was kicked in the stomach and then smacked down again. That was when it all went black. He didn't know where Alexander was or what happened to the big man, but as he looked around he saw that Alexander was chained to the wall, his head hanging before him and blood dripping from his lips.<br/><br/>"Guys!" Ashok shouted and his voice was hoarse, he hadn't been shouting had he? What the hell had they hit them with? He looked around for a weapon, for anything but all he saw was the comms device. He picked it up and started talking into it.<br/><br/>"Anyone there?! Anyone?!" Ashok slowly felt himself slipping back into unconsciousness but he didn't let himself yet. He held on for a bit longer as he crawled over to Tai, he had to help his friend. He reached the big Death Knight and pulled the dagger out, the gasping sound of Tai tasting the air was all he heard before he passed out again.</em><br/><br/>***<br/><br/>((1/2))

<em>Silver saw the smoke and heard the bang before he realized it was coming from the Tavern. He swore and sprinted off with Shivvy and Fenris right behind him. They saw the men leaving the tavern and it was all Silver could do to stop the others before they were under fire. Fenris snarled and tried to jump after them in his worgen form, almost getting to all fours before Silver kicked a leg out from under the man. "No stupid !@#$!" He growled at the worgen, the fire they were under was accurate.<br/><br/>They'd kill Fenris before he got three leaping bounds. Silver was wondering where the Booty Bay Bruisers were for they were nowhere in sight and then he knew they'd been paid off. "Let em go, no way to catch em now. We got bigger fish to fry anyway." He said, checking to see that they were clear and leading the way to the Tavern. He had Shivvy and Fenris stop to collect the spent round casings and the arrows that had been fired at them first though.<br/><br/>He wanted to know who had hit them. He then walked into the tavern and saw Tai starting to groggily get to his feet, cursing and swearing and shivering with hunger. Someone had put the big man down in a hard way. He moved first to Alexander's side to help the big man down. "Easy does it kid..." Silver murmured, Alexander grunting in response.<br/><br/>When Shivvy and Fenris entered they moved to Ashok and Tai's side helping the two up into sitting positions. "Oi! Ashok! Wake the %^-* up!" Fenris said, slapping the man and getting choked out in response.<br/><br/>"Ashy! Quit it ye dolt!" Shivvy responded from where he was next to Tai, the dwarf inspecting the Death Knight's eyes and wondering if he'd make it even 5 minutes without killing something.<br/><br/>"Entreri, Tai's hurtin' ina bad way. Gotta ge' 'im somethin' ta kill."<br/><br/>"Send 'im after the !@#$tards. He can cut a swath an' I know he ain't gonna catch 'em, so it won't matter if'n he goes alone." Entreri made a flippant gesture towards the door and Tai was a blur of motion, howling his rage which sent chills down all their spines as the Death Knight stormed after the attackers.<br/><br/>"%^-*heads gonna regret the day they !@#$ed wit us." Silver said with a quiet laugh as he moved to Ashok's side to see if the man could speak. "Wha' happened brother?"<br/><br/>"We were hit, some kind of disorientation devices. They were good, took Tai down in a matter of seconds, I was out cold... I don't know how Alexander went down. But Silver... They took the chest. They took the research and the weapons." Ashok had grabbed Silver's arm at this point and it was obvious that he was distraught.<br/><br/>"%^-*."<br/><br/>"!@#$ is right comrades... I recognized what little of them I saw. They were Darius' men. And good ones at that." Alexander spoke up softly and then they all started to swear like drunken sailors.<br/><br/>"%^-* jus' got super real..." Silver muttered as he stood up and pressed the button on his comm device.<br/><br/>"Everybody who's listenin'. We jus' got hit. Sha !@#$ is gone. Darius lookin' to be the man behind it."<br/><br/>"This is Alaric, get on your boat and get to Stormwind now. Darius has left the city with his men. I don't know where they went and it appears no one else does. We need to group up and move forward."<br/><br/>"Silver. This is Striker. Where can I meet you to discuss what happened and some other things?"<br/><br/>If any of them were shocked by the fact that Striker had the communication device they didn't show it.<br/><br/>"Stormwind, get yer %^- there fast. Ain't got no time for *!@#." Silver said and then he started packing the last few things up and heading to the ship.<br/><br/>Things were definitely not going according to plan.</em><br/><br/>((2/2))

<em>Kreindis sighed. Zyss wasn't answering her guildstone. He was starting to worry... despite how much he loved her, and how full well he knew how much she loved him. Still, memories that should have been long forgotten bought worry and doubt into his mind.<br/><br/>Kreindis shook his head, clearing those terrible thoughts. "No, Krei. Don't think like that.. she's different. She won't betray me..." He sighed once more, deciding to try again at the guildstone. "Zyss, are you listening, my love? I miss you so much..." He waited, and decided to write a short journal to pass the time. </em><br/><br/>I have finally returned from Pandaria after two hard weeks. Zyss was on my mind every minute.. and now doubt and worry fill my head. I try to shake it off - but how long I can keep doing that I don't know. I need to see her... to renew my confidence. To know she still loves me.<br/><br/>I know deep down she will always love me - but it's hard when I have these terrible memories plaguing my mind... I need to learn to trust her... I HAVE to. Before I am torn apart by these memories and worries. <br/><br/><em>A single thought of how he could do that crosses his mind. "Should I...? Would she say yes..? That's.. the only way we could be bound forever..."</em>

<em>Ratheron had just left Tyrael's office and their discussion was fresh on his mind as he walked the halls of the Spire. He had many things to take care of before the day's end. He first had to set up the trials and then he had to get everyone back to New Dawn for them. From there it would be a nightmare to get everyone to the coast of Quel'thalas to board their ship to Durotar.<br/><br/>He realized why his nephew was good at this kind of thing. He knew how to delegate tasks to those who appropriately filled the role. That and his no excuses mentality led to a group of underlings who didn't push back or make excuses, who did what needed to be done and moved on to the next objective.<br/><br/>Rath was thinking all of this as he changed the message on the Guildstone to let everyone know what was happening.<br/><br/><strong>"To all members of the Fellowship. Due to the approaching deadline for our departure for Durotar and the Siege I have begun setting up a series of tests to assess where we stand in areas of combat, leadership and tactics. All members are to begin their immediate return to New Dawn in preparation for these tests and our departure for Durotar."</strong><br/><br/>He nodded as he re-read the message and put his Guildstone away, now he had other things to take care of. Like informing Lineron and his family what happened in Booty Bay.</em>
