Raine'ka 'watched' the scene, her feet pressed firmly into the dirt. Her eyes had been removed years ago, but her connection to the elements allowed her to see through them. She felt the vibrations of the earth when one took a step, felt the curve in the air as one's body moved through it. Because of this, even from a distance she was able to 'see' what was happening. She allowed the scene to play out until the general began to shout, only then taking action. She charged forward, pulling the old, worn skull she wore down over her face. She was garbed in a mixture of plate and leather, protection and movement. For now she kept her sharp spear in hand, closing in the distance between her and the militia quite quickly. Each forward step she took allowed for her to pull the wind beneath her feet, allowing her to move further with each step. She 'watched' as the first few Frostwolves were executed, snarling beneath her skull of a helmet as she sent the bottom of her spear into the dirt, the air beneath it suddenly swirling into wind strong enough to launch her at her foes. Luckily the militia had been too busy bashing in skulls to notice a single Orc's advance, but caught on the moment she landed behind the first of many. She swung her spear around, aiming not to smash the sharp edge into the Orc's armor, but instead to send a powerful wave of air at his legs. The blackrock was trained and had rooted himself, but the blast was enough to send him off balance mid-bash, allowing Raine'ka to follow-up her swing with a swift plated kick to his leg, sending the armored Orc to his hands and knees before her.<br/><br/>The others turned, their attention drawn from the execution to her instead, the general himself glaring at the masked Orc. " A Frostwolf, alone against the might of the Blackrock? Kill her! " The general shouted with a dark chuckle. Raine gave them little time to advance, swinging her spear around to bash the fallen Orc's exposed head with the sharp tip, effectively knocking him unconscious with a hard enough bash to the temple. She stayed silent, charging closer before spreading her legs out to root herself in a defensive stance, knees bent. The earth at her feet reached up, allowing her to dig her boots into the ground, rooting herself further. The first Blackrock wasted little time in charging the frostwolf, snarling himself as he raised his mace high, only to bring it down at her skull when she made no attempt to move out of his way.<br/><br/>Raine held her ground, gripping her spear with both hands as the mace was brought down towards her skull. She raised her own weapon, held sideways, to block the attack. - The mace came in contact with the hard shaft of the spear just at the end of the handle, inches from the mace's thick metal head. Normally this would do little more than block the incoming attack and damage the spear, but Raine knew what she was doing. The moment the two weapons collided the mace's shaft all but shattered from the impact, to the surprise of the orc wielding it. He had no time to recover before the blunt end of the mace suddenly took a turn and flew through the air, bashing into his forehead with a tilt of Raine's head in his direction. The dazed Orc stumbled back, giving Raine the chance to swing her spear around and jab his plated chest with its pointed bottom, blasting his dazed body back with another strong burst of air, which sent him tumbling into the crowd.<br/><br/>The other Orcs were shocked at the sight of one of their weapons being broken by the shaft of a spear, but it only halted their assault for a moment. The next two Orcs rushed in together, one wielding a sharp axe while the other used a mace similar to the first. Raine, still holding her ground in silence, waited for the larger of the two to reach her and swing his massive axe before making a move. She brought her spear up, tilting it and bashing its strong shaft into the sharp edge of the axe, redirecting its strong swing off to her side with a burst of sparks from the contact. But, there was more to the attack than that, something the Orc did not expect. - Not only was his swing deflected, but his axe acted almost as if it had a mind of its own, using the force he put in to the initial blow against him. His swing continued further than planned before twisting upwards, the sharp edge ripping through the flesh and bone of the Orc that had advanced with him, decapitating him in one fatal blow.<br/><br/>One Orc fell dead while the axe-wielder backed away, looking down at his axe in shock. She was turning his own weapon against him.. But his mind was drawn to more pressing matters the moment he heard the loud rip of rope, his gaze lifting from his weapon in time to see Raine, still rooted, swinging her spear and sending a flurry of wind along the still living Frostwolf capitives, tearing through their bonds. Time for an execution.<br/><br/>( I would continue, but I got cut off! BLARG. Hopefully enough? x3 )

Kargris looked over his shoulder from the boulder he was laying against, peering over its edge into the clearing below, and sighed at what he saw. All he'd wanted to do was find a portal to Mulgore (even though traveling via magic often gave him a head ache), order some deep fried Kodo ribs from the nice Tauren gal in the inn, and pass out in the grass while stargazing. Theoretically, he could leave, he could shuffle away, and turn a blind eye to the whole spectacle.<br/><br/>However, he knew his pride, his honor, and his sense of duty wouldn't survive the scathing of his conscious. So, he did what any battle hardened Warrior of the Horde would do, one that was an Orc as well. He leapt over the top of the boulder, crashing into the earth below, and let out a bone shaking roar. The fourteen - well, fifteen if you counted the big one - Blackrock Orcs turned with wide eyes. Only seven prisoners left. He'd have to make quick work of this if he wanted to be back in Mulgore in time for the ribs to come out of the oil. What? He liked his food, and anyone who tried to spoil it for him could kiss his green !@#.<br/><br/>Kargris pulled his blade off his back, taking several steps backwards as at least seven of them advanced, and realized quite quickly that charging in without a plan might not have been the best idea. Ah hell... He put his sword on his back and ran. Yes, that was right, he - a battle scarred, hardened, and strong willed Orc of the Horde - ran like an idiot across the clearing cursing under his breath, and scrambled around a corner. The ease with which he clocked the first two Blackrock Orcs, decapitating them in one blow, was almost pathetic. What was even more pathetic was him continuing his jog around the camp, and picking up a bottle of boiling oil to throw on three others. Right, he'd taken down five. Five? Yes, that meant nine left as he watched the oil sizzle, and eat away at the flesh of their faces. He shook his head, his nose wrinkling, and snorted at the smell.<br/><br/>"Oops." He turned his head, frowning when the remaining eight goons came barreling around the corner, and stared. They snarled, growled, roared, and foamed at the mouth at the sight of their four dead comrades. Kargris, to his credit, simply smiled, and waved... Before bolting around the side of a caravan. Bad idea, bad idea... He checked his watch. Damnit, twenty minutes! Why did he have to be so honorable? He knew he should have been a Rogue! At least he could have smoke bombed and shanked all these idiots to death if he was!<br/><br/>The red haired Orc dove through a thicket of three grey skinned Blackrocks, their blades scraping over his armor, but none of them managed to penetrate. He kicked himself back to standing, bringing his sword out in one move, and parried a quick succession of strikes from all sides. Kargris felt one of them nick the mail under the plate of his shoulder, slicing through, and he grit his teeth in pain. Two to the right of him leapt and he chose to make a move that would either doom or save him. He rolled backwards, slicing upwards, and split open both of their stomachs. Their intestine splattered in the dirt, blood spraying over his face, and he faced the last seven of them.<br/><br/>They looked nervous almost, their eyes darting between each other, shifting stances, and weapons still bared. Kargris wiped the sweat from his face, frowning at the feel of the sticky grime from the dirt. He flicked off the debris, rolling his shoulders, and smirked. "Who's next?" A shadow loomed over the men before him, causing them to make room, and the general stepped forward with a snarl.<br/><br/>"You killed seven of my best men."<br/><br/>"If those were your best this is going to be easier than I thought."<br/><br/>"Stand and fight coward!" He practically screeched. Kargris rubbed at his ear in annoyance.<br/><br/>"$%^- off, I'm not in the mood."<br/><br/>By the end of the night he was sitting cross legged in Bloodhoof Village with a very cold platter of ribs, his armor dented, and gouged. The mail would need to be restrung, the grill of his helm screwed back in, and his sword needed to be sharpened. The Blackrock General's tusks, however, had been added to the necklace around his neck. He grumbled, munching softly, and started bandaging a deep cut on his arm. Oh well, there was always tomorrow...

Lurking beneath the shadows, Zed watched painfully as the Wolves fell before the Blackrocks. A sickening feeling growing deep within him as he watched the massacre unfold "Like sheep to the slaughter" he muttered. As more and more Frostwolves fell, it would not take long for the last to fall, a hasty action was needed. Taking a feline form Zed's eyes glared the battlefield, smirking, as the General seemed unguarded by this point, having most his men's attention focused on the slaughter. Bolting from the shadows and weaving his way around behind the general as he looked on with a sinful gaze of glee at his work. I growled low, soon he would fall silent as I crept close, his men much too distracted with their fun to notice. As I approached, my forepaw clinked a helmet "!@#$.." I exclaimed, just managing to leap backword as the general spun around with such speed I barely had time to react as he brought his huge mace down in front of me, splintering the helmet in to sparkling shards of metal. He cackled manically at my attempt to sneak up on him and I stood ready. Unfortunately for him, he had struck the ground with such force, that his mace had become wedged in-between the floorboards, he grunted and tugged at it with such force that the mace was ripped from the ground, splintering wood chips down on me, doing so, he had lost his footing. I growl rumbled in my throat as he fell to his %^-*, and with a single bound I was on him, sinking my fangs deep within the throat of the mortal beast, my claws, tearing flesh from his wretched body. <br/><br/>I still remember the taste, and the sight of his men as they turned to see their general fall, Orc blood covering my fur and flesh dripped from my fangs. They were shocked, scared even. With the moments distraction the Wolves seemed to be filled with new vigar, outnumbered they fought back bravely against the Blackrocks, I stood by their side for the remainder of the battle, with their general gone, the Blacks moral was diminished and so they fled, or died trying

The massive Orc huntress crawled up the ridgeline, staying mostly hidden behind the rocks infront of herself. She had been tracking them for quite some time at this point, eyes narrowing as she gazed from the Blackrocks, to the Frostwolf Orcs bound behind them; Her clan members. The woman was indifferent to the Shattered Hand. Her pale green ears perk as she heard the Blackrock general speak, a quiet, rumbling growl escaping her as she raised from her sitting position to crouch behind one of the large boulders, silently drawing her ivory bow and pulling an arrow from her quiver. She had just moved to draw her bow, but was a moment too late! As the generals' mace came down on the Shattered Hands' head, she winced and took in a quiet breath. Just as the general gave the command to set the prisoners free, a lovely ivory arrow would bury itself between his eyes and he would crumple to the ground. Vish'qah grinned triumphantly, but her victory was short-lived as she seen a Frostwolf orc take a mace to the face. The woman let out another low growl as she began to pull arrow after arrow from her quiver, her movements each fluid and graceful. Every arrow she loosed found its' mark, either plunging between eyes or burying itself into a throat. The Frostwolves would begin glancing around curiously as the Blackrocks started dropping like flies. One of the Orcs finally manages to spot the huntress, who had been perched upon a rock nearby. He'd let out a ferocious roar, smacking a fist over his heart and pointing at Vish'qah. The huntress only smiled broadly, her form slowly vanishing. <br/><br/>(These things have never been my strong point, so I apologize if it is somewhat crappy.)

Grel'kar, having watched this scenario from afar, considered it with a slight narrow of the eyes. His lips twitched back, baring a fang-displaying sneer in the direction of the slaughter. His gaze settled on what had appeared to have been the commander, giving the distant figure an idle once over. Simultaneously, his right hand adjusted it's grip on the simple steel spear he wielded, his left hand idly padding to assure that his axe remained strapped just over his left shoulder, and that his twin knives where still at the back of his belts. <br/><br/>"Lok'tar Ogar." The monk huffed under his breath, and with one last quick check, broke out into a sprint. <br/><br/>The position he'd picked had kept him just out of view from the group, which now seemed fully engrossed in their slaughter. His sprint was sounded off with a dull smack of his boots against dirt, but was certainly not enough noise to overpower the jeers of the attackers and the ever distinct <em>CRACK</em> of metal and the <em>SPLAT</em> of brain content. A stealthy approach, therefore, had been abandoned in favor of a speedy one. <br/><br/>Rushing in, Grel'kar drew on a small amount of chi to seep into his muscles, pushing away any concern for weariness and rushed through with a calm, sharpening certainty. <br/>The commander, the general of the little militia, perhaps out of instinct a sixth sense the more experienced gained when it came to danger, or just the need to stretch his neck, turned his head just enough to catch sight of the orc bulldozing his way towards him. Grel'kar, noting the movement, did the first thing that came to his mind. <br/>Hefting up his spear mid sprint, he threw the spear towards the general's head. <br/><br/>He knew the throw was !@#$ the moment it left. Thankfully, the General didn't seem to catch that fact as he turned to face it and lifted his mace up to swat it out of the air. <br/><br/>Ripping the axe from it's sheath as the spear was knocked away, Grel'kar barreled into the commander with a hungry snarl and an overhead slash, backing it up with the power of is arms, shoulders, and the forward momentum of his body. The weapons slammed together, a screeching parry of metal on metal. Whatever next move the General sought to make was interrupted as Grel'kar's right hand, free of the spear, rushed forward and jabbed into his neck. The fist slammed into throat, crushing the windpipe like a fleshy can that just found itself between a boot and the floor. It folded with a sickening crunch and bloody shout from the General, which was composed with about 95% blood and 5% shout. <br/><br/>It was enough, at least, to catch the attention of the nearest Blackrock militiaman, who released his own surprised shout that caught the attention of the other nearest Blackrock, who repeated the process, which only seemed to confuse the two Blackrock nearest them, whom had gotten very invested in their skull bashing. <br/><br/>It was amidst this sudden confusion of communication that Grel'kar leapt at the original shouter, dropping his ax in the process. This earned a surprised raise of the brow from his target and a cocky, toothy grin and a blood thirsty roar. The orc lashed his club out at the advancing monk, whom ducked underneath the strike with surprising agile, accomplished with a mixture of his own height, and a simultaneous effort of bending his knee and leaning forward. Pushing out in more of a dive than a charge, he rushed beneath the orc's arms and into his range, sending a quick series of short ranged jabs into the Blackrock's abdomen and lower ribs. <br/><br/>Each blow landed with a meaty thump, doing just enough to sound bruising. The small blasts of chi that rushed out, though, pierced through the leather, skin, fat, and meat and even struck through to ring against the bone. The last two blows resounded with a very distinct mixture of a crack and a pop, accompanied by a pained roar from the orc just before he crumpled to the ground. Not wasting a breath, Grel'kar. Turning on his heel, he was met with the sight of a new opponent rushing towards him in the midst of a club swing. The monk bared his teeth, lifting and bracing his forearms together to create an impromptu meatshield in front of him. The club slammed across them, the pain lancing up each limb to momentarily scream into the monk's mind. Pushing it out, he stepped forward, pushing the club back with his left forearm and lashed out with his right hand. He wielded it like his own club, answering the orc's strike with a vicious backhand across the jaw that released a small blast of chi, giving just enough power to cause the orc's head to snap to the side at the blow and gain a dazed look. This dazed effect, mixed with the speed of the follow up, allowing Grel'kar to follow the backhand up with a quick jab straight into orc's face, feeling the cartilage of his nose snap beneath his fist and sent him reeling back. <br/><br/>With a throaty snarl, the monk pushed forward without pause.

"Blood and Honor...Nazguroth, where did we go wrong?" Kurtog growled in a low whisper as he gently rested his hand upon the back of the large boar who'd been his lifelong companion. The hunter stood alone, but not unseen, by the Blackrock orcs and their prisoners. As a matter of fact, in this moment they were allies under the banner of the Iron Horde. He had willingly followed his Warchief here, and before, when all the world turned against him, Kurtog lifted his bow in aid. His belief in the dream that drove him to the acts that would forever brand him as "The Fang of Dranosh-Ar" still burned as brightly as they did in the beginning. <br/><br/>This went against those dreams, those ideals which he held so dear. As Kurtog watched silently while the Blackrocks cut down the helpless Frostwolf Orcs one by one, he felt his stomach churn uncomfortably. Orcs killing orcs, it was counter-intuitive. He understood the necessity of it, in wartime, but not like this. If these were men, or even elves, Kurtog might have never even spared them a thought, but these were Orcs! Give them axes and let them die with honor! His mind screamed out in tandem with each blow of a hammer or mace against Orcish flesh.<br/><br/>His warchief had brought them here, he had promised a new dawn for his people, and he had signed it all in an oath. The oath of every warchief. "Blood and Honor." He growled out once again, the timber of his voice raising ever so slightly, though it was still drowned out by the laughter of the executioners. The hunter's mind was at war with itself. He had walked through fire and iron, braved the dangers of armies and an impossible war, all on the back of a belief which was inspired by a single Orc. His Warchief.<br/><br/>"Not my Warchief..." <br/><br/>He heard himself say the words, and the levy broke. The Blackrock orcs were setting themselves upon one of the few remaining prisoners, a den mother, when suddenly there was a soft click and one of the Blackrocks dropped in a heap. The rest jerked their heads in unison to the hunter, standing alone with his crossbow trained. Another click, and a second body crumpled to the dirt. Then, chaos erupted as, with their attentions occupied by the turncoat hunter, the Blackrock unit had no defense as the boar came crashing into them like cannon fire.<br/><br/>Two shots from the crossbow was enough for him, and as he let it drop to the sands, Kurtog gripped a long spear and stalked forward. The first orc was nothing, and as he raised his muscled arms up for an overhead swing of his maul, the Hunter's spear slipped in between the grooves of his armor like a serpent, and he cut the soldier down like a dog. The next took a more defensive posture, raising his shield before Kurtog, but a swift kick into the center of that heavy metal bulwark sent the orc spawling backwards, off his footing. With that, it was but a quick-step in and a powerful thrust to send the orc to his grave.<br/><br/>Then his path opened, and his eyes settled on the leader of this little warband. He saw the Orc's grip tighten on his warhammer, and saw the fear and anger mingling in his eyes. "Traitor!" He spat. "You turn against your own, against the Iron Horde?! Against your Warchief?!" To this, a slow growl began to emanate from the Hunter, one that set the Blackrock leader back on his heels. "...This." He pointed the blade of his spear at the Frostwolf bodies laid low in the dirt. "...This is not my Horde." He growled, jerking the blade of his spear back to face the Orc as he stalked in for the duel. "...And Hellscream...Is not my Warchief..."

Lorhiia's eyes seem to tremble in sight of each of her pack members fall. A low, unusual growl escapes her lips. This Orcess is usually very peaceful, and doesn't interfere in battles. But this.. this was different. <br/><br/>Lorhiia quickly jumps down, taking off toward the battle. Armed with her axes Peace and Honor, she hopes to accomplish those two things. Her blades seem to slice through the air with little to no effort, letting anyone who challenges her defensive stance fall before her as well as to her hands. Her throws differ, as well as the placement of her feet. She moves quick; not even one with a quick eye could judge where or how she was going to move. Soon after the throw or pin occurs, Honor would fall upon the designated Blackrock's neck.<br/><br/>As the last Blackrock falls to their knees, Lorhiia kneels and prepares each of the bodies to be rightfully burned. <br/><br/>Even demons deserve eternal peace.<br/><br/>This is a philosophy Lorhiia has lived by for a long time.<br/><br/>As the rest of the surviving Frostwolves head home, one stays still. Lorhiia is attending to the fire, the smell of burning metal plaguing the air. <br/><br/>Lorhiia sighs, gentle words escaping her lips. "Another day."

May watched as the Orcs were slaughtered. Fears gripped at her mind for a moment before she snapped back, a slight guilt tugged at her as she contemplated simply leaving them. Having decided she'd do what she felt was right, she quickly thought of a plan, taking a moment to observe the area. She noticed a lone Cannon not to far from the Fighting pit. She quickly way over, trying her best to not be spotted. She took a good look at the Cannon and an idea sparked. <br/><br/>May crouched in front of the cannon and gripped it by the lip, calling on the elements she widened the entrance of the barrel, it would come to resemble something like the end of a blunderbuss. she came around to the back and turned the cannon around, and with a little elbow grease, pushed it up near the Fighting pit, The General quickly took notice as the cannon had just gotten into place. May pressed her palm against the Coarse earth and churned the sand and rock into a smoldering molten pool, drawing on it, she filled the cannon with the slag and lined up her shot. The General Called out "GET DOWN!" And he lept from his perch to take cover. The Cannon sprayed a wave of hot slag cover the Fighting pit, many were quickly brought down to the ground, either dead or smoldering. May quickly reloaded the cannon once more and just before on of the surviving orcs could reach the edge of the pit, she fired once more and another spray took out the rest of the Blackrock. Many of the remaining Frostwolves had been slumped over or on the ground and managed to survive the blasts.<br/><br/>The General peaked his head from his cover and found his target, He sprinted with deathly speed at the Cannon and brought down his massive mace onto the barrel, shattering it into pieces. He'd quickly give another swing, this time at May who fell back in her evasion of the swing. May quickly began to scramble away from the furious Warrior and tried her best to regain her standing. the General took swing after swing chasing after her, but the moment May had regained her balance, she drew her mace, the second her grip tightened on the handle it burst into a plume of fire and Molten Slag, delivering a quick parry to the Generals next swing, knocking it aside. May took this opportunity to deliver a devastating blow to the Generals left side, one of the spikes of her mace digging deep.<br/><br/>The orc was tough though, and he pushed her off of him, the spike tearing up more of his side, he knew he was likely dead, but was certainly going to kill the person responsible. He Did his best to ignore the wound, letting out a harsh roar as he let out a fierce series of swing, several missing, but the last two being a graze and then a direct hit, respectfully. The Hit was right in her left arm, and it sent her spinning, The orc grappled her by the head and slammed it into his knee. Her vision shot black as it made impact, a red haze filled her mind as pain surged violently. She gave a pained growl and began to swing blindly, they clashed, swing for swing. Miss, miss, miss, Parry, miss. The flurry did little, and a savage rage filled her as she went in for one more swing and molten slag surged once more in her weapon, she landed a direct hit into the orc's right side, cutting deep once more. <br/><br/>The General, Staggered and wounded, dropped his weapon. May dug out her mace and raised it High and brought it down on the orc's head, digging deep, blood trickling down his face as life was instantly snapped from his body.<br/><br/>As the Generals body fell tot he ground May would breath heavily. She'd turn looking over the fighting pit, most of the Frostwolves were dead, but the remaining ones had already made their escape. May figured it was time she made her own, and took her leave.

Gugror's hands trembled on the shaft of his axe as the soft , warm Draenor rain tapped on the crown if his helm creating a quiet and calming beat that enveloped his mind. He had gotten used to doing that, shifting his focus from reality. This time was like any other, he thought as the Troll captain made his way through the shadows behind the trench that they were settled in. The orc could hear the feint sloshing of the mud under his captain's heavy footsteps slosh the thick, disturbed ground underneath the regiments' entrenched position. "Take it easy now, Gugror." the Troll said, laying his hand on the Orcs shoulder as a show of support. The orc turned slightly to catch his captain just on the periphery of his vision. He said nothing, just gave a soft grunt and a nod to acknowledge the Troll. As the captain removed his hand and moved away, he whispered to the seven Orc Beserkers, including Gugror, that made up the auxiliary unit they called the 'Gnasher squad" the Troll said to them in his low, accented voice " You boys be ready for dis'? We know da plan, and we know what to do. Ready you Axes Gnashers, when de first Axe falls on da shattered hand, we move to free da' frostwolves." Gugror tightened his grip and let out a long, drawn out breath through the face-plate of his Helm. He didn't like wearing a headpiece, he found it very restricting.He focused his thoughts on his youth, of the days he spent chasing down wild boar and cleaving them with a swing of his mighty axe. He remembered the smell of blood and he could feel his rage boiling inside of him. As his training prescribed, he knew how to let it amalgamate and pool in his mind's eye, letting his ferocity lay dormant until the time was right.<br/><br/>They were about 50 paces from the Blackrock Courtyard, face down in a creek bed that they had fashioned into a small ridge of cover. Gugrors eyes barely reached over the wall of grass and dirt, now turning into slick mud and beaded blades of grass. He could see the Huge Blackrock Orc lean down to the shattered hand and whisper something. The Troll captain stood upright and raised a fist in the air, signaling the Gnashers to ready the strike. Gugror looked to his right, as he was on the far left side, to the Veteran Orc next to him. Thhe old orc was still and silent, not even making a sound as the breath escaped his scarred lips and chipped tusks. The Veteran turned slightly toward Gugror and offered a little smirk before turning his attention back towards the camp. They were still, all of them, only the relentless pitter-patter of the rain could be heard. The Blackrock executioner let out a loud chuckle and heaved his heavy axe down upon the chained Shattered hand, splitting his head from his body and sending a shower of viscous red blood spurting and mixing with the mist of the rain. The trolls hand seemed to drop in slow motion as the Beserkers, with the speed of a charging Gronn, scaled the mudy shoreline and began screaming and roaring violently while charging toward the unsuspecting camp. The Blackrock executioner turned in their direction, and hastily yelled to the other Blackrocks at the ready by numerous bound frostwolves " Free the prisoners! Quickly, before their allies arrive!" Gugror watched in horror while he trampled through brush and mud as the enemies axes fell one by one on the prisoners, cleaving and smashing the souls from the frostwolf allies. His rage welled up tenfold, until he could not contain it. He ripped off his helmet and threw it to the side. He reared his head back and roard louder then he had every before. He then took off towards the camp again, passing his squad mates and flipping up chunks of mud and vegetation underneath his feet. He closed the gap almost instantaniously and was on the first executioner before it could remove its axe from the healess corpse before him. Gugror's howl drowned out the Blackrocks cries as the Beserkers axe rended him in two from the collarbone to the hip. Without losing momentum, gugror plunged through the split orc while a shower of blood covered his face and armor. As he ran through the body, he grabbed the executioners unused axe with one hand and transferred his own to weapon to the other. Still charging at full force, he descended upon the second orc who, although he was prepared with axe in hand, there was no use in trying to defend against the whirrling dervish before him. With two swift motions, Gugror knocked the defenders axe from his way and with the other, brought the executioners axe down on the orc skull, splitting it to the nose. The orcs scalp peeled back in a gory mess of brain and blood. Gugros second axe cracked and shattered skull bone as he yanked it out with a *crucnch* Gugror stood there as the lifeless body fell before him and twitched for a few moments before falling still. He watched as the thick red substance leaked out from the once proud orc. He stood still as his allies ran behind him and engaged the other Execution

ers in fierce combat. Roars and screams rose to a deafening reverberation as axes collided and sent sparks sizzling from the hot metal. Gugror watched the battle take place while still standing in the same spot that he had watched the very soul leave one of his own kinds body. He then turned his attention to the massive Executioner Commander, who was locked in combat with the Troll captain. Although the troll was a ferocious warrior, and his speed gave him a great advantage over the lumbering, heavy orc, one misplaced footstep gave way through layers of slick mud, causing the troll to lose his footing as the Giant Orc thrusted downward harshly, his axe finding its place in the gut of the displaced troll. The blow was so fierce, that it sent the trolls lower guts exploding through his back and splattering underneath him. Seeing this, gugror snapped back into his blood rage, and wielding his two axes, he charged once more towards the giant orc. The executioner readied for the brunt force attack, raising his axe defensively. Gugror saw his shift in posture, allowing the Blackrock to effectively become a cemented mass. Gugror knew that the orc out-strengthened him, so he assessed his options and found a solution as the gap between the two closed. The blackrock grinned as he saw the little orc rushing towards him, he had no fear of this puny thing, as he had destroyed more than his share of even greater enemies. But, as he was reminscing on battles past, he wasnt paying attention and the Beserker slid to his back on the blood-thickened mud and slid between the legs of the orc. The Huge orc looked down just as Gugrors axes sliced the insides of his thighs down to the bone. He didnt have tome to process the pain before the small orc was at his back, hacking and slashing into the orange flesh, sending chunks of muscle and sinews flying behind him. Gugror carved even faster as the blood drenched his face even more, he eventually started hearing the crunch of bone and spine as he dug deeper into the executioner. The other Berserk had to pull Gugror off of the emaciated corpse that lie, indistinguishable from a pile of mashed and mangled meat. Gugror calmed himself and sat in the mud, the sun peeking from behind grey clouds. A beam hit his face and he felt the warmth on his blood encrusted mug. The battle, was done, and the mission, was lost.

The large Orc scowled at the spectacle before him, taking care to stay out of sight for the time being. As the Shattered Hand Orc was killed, Brutok would grit his teeth. The armor they wore was nearly identical to his - meaning one thing. These were Blackrock. These were -his- people. What honor is there in slaying a bound foe on his knees, however? Absolutely none. Just as the order to 'set them free' was given, Brutok would take a deep breath and step into view.<br/><br/>"Hold, brothers! You think you can just kill this lot without letting me crack a few skulls?! Besides, I have a personal quarrel with THAT one." He'd bark, jutting a plated finger towards a cowering Frostwolf. Approaching confidently, he'd stride right up to the commanding officer. "Brutok Spineshatter, reporting for duty. Permission to end my quarrel?"<br/><br/>A few more hushed words were spoken between the two before Brutok gave a slow nod. "Excellent." Pulling his battleaxe from his back, he'd slowly stomp over to the bound Frostwolf. Now surrounded by a mass of Blackrock, who were eagerly waiting for the Orc to prove himself, he'd grip the weapon with both hands and raise it high above his head. Silence hung in the air for what seemed like an eternity as Brutok closed his eye, readying himself.<br/><br/>Quickly whipping around, he'd bring the weapon down and bury it into the unarmored area between the unsuspecting officer's neck and shoulder. Catching them all by surprise, Spineshatter would rip the axe from his victim and charge the next closest enemy - swinging his axe upwards in a diagonal fashion. With two Orcs down and three more to go, he'd turn to meet them all eye to eye.<br/><br/>"Remove the bonds from these Orcs and walk away! Nobody else has to die!" He'd roar. Rather than being met with conversation, he was met with the remaining three orcs charging towards him. Bellowing a deafening warcry, he'd move to meet them halfway.<br/><br/>After the final three on one battle, a single, battered Orc remained. The armor adorning him was dented and sprayed with blood. Several bruises and cuts covered what parts of him were not-so-amored, leaving the Orc exhausted. Sluggishly trudging over to the remaining prisoners, he'd pull a serrated dagger from his waistband and cut the ties from one of them. Placing the small weapon into the prisoner's hands, he'd only offer an exhausted groan and nod. Holding a wad of cloth to a wound on his chest, he'd begin making his way to the nearest tavern. "This is why I don't leave the city..." he'd grumble.

The pair of binoculars were withdrawn, and the smug frown of dissatisfaction hung heavily over Nak'shor's features. The deep voice rumbled out from his chest, the dissonant sound of his voice dragging along his gullet like gravel shifting down a hillside in an avalanche. "So much for death before dishonor." With a sigh, the large orc slid soundlessly from his perch in the canopy of a nearby tree, swinging along it's branches towards the ground with unparalleled dexterity and haste. The branches bent and groaned in protest at his weight as he maneuvered among them, before he settled to the dirt, leather soles conjuring a small cloud of dust underneath his feet as he landed with a 'thud'. Swiftly, the brown-skinned Bleeding Hollow made his way through the underbrush, silently approaching the Blackrock warriors.<br/><br/>In another time, the Bleeding Hollow wouldn't have even batted an eye at the unceremonious slaughtering of another clan. It mattered little, the politics among the Clans, when you were struggling to survive in the jungles. The gloomstalkers and ever-encroaching threat of Arrakoa gave little time to ponder the many intricacies of honor bound death and war. Times change. Nak'shor grew steadily closer to the band of executioners, each fell hammer swing bringing forth it's macabre resonation as the skull of another Frostwolf orc was caved in. After the fourth swing, Nak'shor roared with primal vigor, if anything, attempting to halt the sound of the fell blows. The force of his yell sparked the curiosity of the elements that so readily awaited the Bleeding Hollow's call. The smoldering edge of an axe blade sparked magnificently as the elements responded to his vigor, flames beginning to lap at the weapon's edge in anxious waiting of the coming storm.<br/><br/>The first Blackrock had little time to react, and was slain immediately as Nak'shor emerged from the brush. The axe in his right hand found home in the warrior's shoulder, sizzling as the wound hissed viciously at the touch of fire. Without time to grunt, the Blackrock fell, and the blade was ripped from his chest, the armor melted around the wound. The momentum continued, and Nak'shor endured, and the resulting chaos was astounding. With the arrival of the Bleeding Hollow, the Frostwolves found their own fury invoked, and stood against the shackles of the offenders. With the Blackrock focus split, Nak'shor easily wove between the dozen or so warriors, axes whirling magnificently as they sliced through the air, singing their songs of death as the weapons felled the Blackrock. With each executioner slain, Nak'shor allowed his axe to come down upon the chains of the Frostwolves, steadily turning the tides of battle until none but the General remained.<br/><br/>The venerable Blackrock sneered as the Bleeding Hollow approached, pulling an axe of his own free from a leather holster that kept it readily at his side. He tested it's weight, tossing it between his hands a few times before taking a practiced battle stance. No words were needed, and Nak'shor stepped forward. With a deep breath, the Bleeding Hollow drew in fury of air, and bellowed a roar so earth shattering the spilled blood on the floor rippled in it's wake. The directed gale towards the general was strong enough to blind him temporarily, long enough for Nak'shor to bury his axe into the ground. The dirt split cleanly, giving way to the axe, before the elements spewed forth from the blade. The ground shattered, and gave way as the tremors overtook the earth, cracking and rumbling as the rock beneath shifted. The sunder continued, until the split opened beneath the General, swallowing his right leg into the newly created sinkhole. The axe was wrenched from the ground, and the hole closed once more, the earth snapping back to position, clamping the Blackrock's leg into the earth. <br/><br/>Pushing past the pain, the General spat out at Nak'shor, "Finish it, you jungle pig!" He struggled against the earth in vain, unable to move anything below his waist. Nak'shor approached slowly, and truthfully exhausted, from the previous skirmish. Standing just outside the swipe range of the General's axe, he knelt, picking up a small bit of dirt in a pinch and rubbing it between a thumb and forefinger before wordlessly casting the fine powder into the General's eyes. The Bleeding Hollow stood and looked to the silent, and now-freed Frostwolves, before nodding to the hammers on the ground. "Take your prize, Frostwolves." He began to walk, the sound of metal sliding across the ground as the severed chains moved towards the weapons. The General called out in a shrill voice, "Now, Frostwolves.. I'm sure we can reach some sort of-.." But the voice was cut off as the first hit of a hammer connected with his head. Nak'shor looked to the horizon, sundown was fast approaching, and the trek back to Orgrimmar would be lengthy.

Tumira was not new to bloodshed; she was not new to the sight of her own kin slaughtering one another, torturing one another, betraying one another… how easily it could’ve been to just walk away. Just walk away from all of this and never look back. She didn’t need to save all of these Frostwolf orcs; she didn’t even need to care. But the smugness of this orc – this Blackrock worm – the assassin didn’t like him, she didn’t like how his tactics worked. It reminded her of the time she was trained as an assassin, a spy… it reminded her of that dreadful orc that had tortured her into the assassin that she is now.<br/><br/> She would see to it that he drowned in his own blood, just like she did to <strong><em>him</em></strong>.<br/><br/> From the shadows she struck, any and all Blackrock orcs met their fate from the deadly edge of her daggers, poisoning their blood streams, letting them die a slow, or quick death. It was easy; these orcs cannot catch her slender frame, so agile and quick, almost like a ghost haunting their very presence. The bloodlust was always so easy, how it tempted her like a succubus’ dark spell. Ah, but she was not under any control, for she willingly enjoys the thrill of gutting her foes. But her work would not go unnoticed.<br/><br/> The Blackrock commander barked at his troops, pointing at the orcess that dared to slaughter his men, lowering the numbers of his troops within these prison walls – the Frostwolves were retaliating against his distracted forces, in a matter of minutes, he would be outnumbered. It’s best to take care of the actual problem – if only they could catch her.<br/><br/> The assassin was no fool to be overwhelmed, she would not be taken prisoner – never again would she be behind bars. With great ferocity she slayed the orcs that dared to get in her path, making her way to the commander as the Frostwolf prisoners overwhelmed the rest of the Blackrock troops, making the worm a stray pup within a pit of angry wolves. She was now face-to-face with the Blackrock commander, her grin very much visible upon her features.<br/><br/> He would only laugh at her. <br/><br/> “You’re so <em>frail</em> for an orc, pup.” He taunted, readying himself with his heavy axe, his confidence glowing upon his features. “You’ve made a great mistake facing against me, for you have no shadows to hide now.”<br/><br/> He was right, but Tumira does not need to hide to kill her target.<br/><br/> The Blackrock commander lunges at her, giving a powerful swing with his axe, and of course the assassin dodges his attack with great ease, almost as if she wasn’t even trying. But the commander did not stop there. He gave no time for Tumira to attack, giving the orcess a lesser opportunity to bring in any offensive strikes. He’s only delaying the inevitable, she thought as she jumped away from another heavy swing of the commander’s ace. He was becoming tired, exhausted even, hearing the yells and roars coming from the background, he’s becoming unfocused, side eyeing his fallen men – doubt plagued his mind.<br/><br/> That is when she struck.<br/><br/> He did not feel it at first, the assassin’s daggers were so sharp… it wasn’t even seconds until blood began to poor from his neck, and fill up his mouth. He could taste his own blood. In a futile attempt to perhaps stop his bleeding, he pressed his palms against his neck, his knees feeling heavy, making him crumble to the ground. His crimson eyes wide open in shock, his lips trembling – those eyes looking up at the cause of his death. This frail orcess, with daggers so sharp – the last thing that he sees is that grim upon her face and his own blood that had sprayed along her face and armor.<br/><br/> She would be the haunting of his afterlife.

Nazgorn would quickly unsheathe his mighty swords and charge up the steep cliff until he got to the cliffs edge, were he would jump in the air holding both his swords high above his head until he came within arms reach with the Orc's. As Nazgorn landed on the ground he impaled both his swords into the chest of two Blackrock Orc's that were about to sacrifice two of the Frostwolf Prisoners. He yelled *Go now!* to the Frostwolf Prisoners while he held off the rising tide of Blackrock Orc's that would soon surround him and overtake him but Nazgorn is no pushover and he easily evades the clumsy Blackrock Orc's reckless strikes that left them open to Nazgorn's attacks, which Nazgorn used to his advantage by striking relentlessly at the Blackrock Orcs at the areas on their bodies that they left un guarded. One by one the Blackrock Orc's fell at Nazgorn's feet and his war cry was enough to send the lesser Orc's running in fear which thin'd their numbers greatly. After a good long time of fighting the waves of Blackrock Orc's that once moved against him were nothing but broken corpses lying on the ground. Tired and wounded from minor strikes that the Blackrock Orc's were able to inflict on him Nazgorn dropped both his swords and fell to his knees while breathing heavily. Two Frostwolf Orc's would approach Nazgorn and would pick him up and carry him away from the battle field to the nearest encampment to were he could be given food, and bandages for his wounds and also some much needed rest. (The End.)

As the other prisoners were shaking in fear, Eragoth only peered foward to the Blackrock Orc, accumulating what he needed to do next. The orc was almost victorious, and in any situation, a smart prison keeper wouldn’t have waited so long to execute the Frostwolf. But this wasn’t the case; The Orc let himself open, as he allowed the prisoners out, and it was this action alone which sealed the Shattered Hand Orc to his demise, distracting him for a moment to allow Eragoth to strike.<br/><br/>With only a moment to open on the Orc, Eragoth took the opportunity and came out of hiding, fiercly ambushing him from behind. Eragoth attacked, using the same emotion that drove Eragoth to fight for the Scourge, and the same emotion that allows him to represent the Banshee Queen; because it certainly isn’t the fear to keep his own life that motivated Eragoth to strike, nor was it to simply help the other Frostwolves. <br/><br/>It wasn’t to help bring down a new threat brought by the the Blackrock Orcs, and it wasn’t to prove to others his skill as a fierce warrior-- It was hate--This, and only this, is what drove Eragoth to impale the back of the Throat of this Blackrock Orc. This, and only this, is what drove Eragoth to allow the orce to live just a few moments after the blade sliced through the hollow esophagus. This, and only this, is what made Eragoth grip the orcs head upright and force the Proud orc to watch his fellow Blackrock Orcs witness his very own execution. The orc would struggle, but the blade was deep within the neck, pinning him to any position Eragoth wished, and with a bit force from his grip, Eragoth pulled at the head and the Shattered hand saw it rip cleanly off the Orc’s body. Head in hand, Eragoth peered forward at the Militia as his new target. As he dropped the Orc’s head, Eragoth would swing his blade to his side, splashing blood on the ground. Eragoth would say nothing as he jumped into the militia-- this, and only this.

Kirmali sits on the little hillside perch she had set up, glancing down at the scene momentarily before going back to her rifle. She opens the breech mechanism on her rifle, and dug a handful of shells out of her ammo pouch. She began to press shell after shell into it, before closing the mechanism and cocking her rifle. Resting her rifle against her shoulder with one hand, she uses her free hand to dig into another pouch, pulling out a little lollipop. She clumsily pries off the paper and pops it into her mouth. She grins devilishly, using her tongue to push the lollipop stick to hang from the corner of her mouth.<br/><br/>Bringing her rifle up, she aimed down the sights at the general and let off a single shot, the bullet soaring across the field with a faint whistling that was silenced as it crashed through the general's skull. Knowing her position would be found out soon, she ejected the spent casing and fired off another shot. Shell after shell began to rain down on the Blackrock Orcs in rapid staccato, the bullets filling the battlefield with a glorious 'song' from the whistling ammunition. A Blackrock Orc screams and points towards her position, allowing the remaining Blackrock Orcs to charge up the hill at the marksman's nest. As they began to charge up the hill, she grinned, pushing the lollipop stick to the opposite corner of her mouth and turning to flee. <br/><br/>The first orc would stop dead in his tracks as he came over the side of the hill, the marksman having fled a small distance away would wave as a miniature iron star rolled up to them with the words "LOKTAR OGAR" painted sloppily on the front with red paint. By the time they realized what was happening, the little iron star exploded, showering the hillside with blackrock body parts. <br/><br/>Happy with her work, she headed for the Frostwolf Prisoners only to be stopped as she felt a hand around her left ankle. Glancing down she noticed a Blackrock crawling on his belly, his legs missing as he weakly held onto the woman's ankle. With a resounding crunch she finished off the lolli, pulling it from her mouth to place the depleted lolli stick against his forehead. She then promptly stood back up, shook her ankle from his grasp, and continued down towords the Frostwolf Prisoners.

The hush of the day had been all but erased as the scene had evolved before her vibrant amber eyes. The slaughter, the blood-shed, everything just drove her primal instincts to the brink of a fully born lust for blood. Yet she stayed, steadying herself until the time to strike was nigh!<br/><br/>The echoing sounds of the chaos below only further rumbled into the swirling frenzy that was Ta'zela's mind. A soft snort, rolling into a sick chuckle, and the beast was rolling her shoulders to push her closer. Melding herself to the scenery, she was able to make a quick advance upon the falling prisoners. Without so much of a sound, she was entering the fray. Ta's maw quickly snapped down as she escaped the shadows, crunching into the neck of the unsuspecting Blackrock. A twist of her head and his neck was snapped. The broken orc fell to the ground, a display of the woman's might and ferocity to warn the others. Release the tiger's fury, only to meet her fangs.<br/><br/>A roar burst forth from her maw as she began to charge, paws churning up every bit of debris in her way. Her roar shook the very skies and bashed away at the clouds. Amber eyes narrowed once more as she leaped into the weapons that rivaled her claws and fangs. This was beautiful. A deep inhale of the scent of blood, and all senses were lost. Churning up the dust and clawing her way through, she'd not remember much of her tiger slaughter until the dust settled and the last drop of blood was shed.

Pelk watched, observing the crude methods of the Militia. "This isn't right... It's horrible! ...They're doing it all wrong!" Pelk shouted, fruitlessly wiping an old stain on his jacket as he does. "Death is an ultimate escape from crime! An eternal sleep is punishment? NO! You have to make them suffer!" He approached the militia in the act as he said this. They turned their heads, beholding Pelks glorious toned, muscular body and their jaws dropped. They then dropped to their knees in worship... Once Pelks little thought bubble popped, the Orcs saw his threat and charged him. "Oh crap!" He reeled his hands back, right of his waist. He charged up a summoning spell, calling apon his Wrathguard. Not a moment too soon, the demon arrives. Making its presence known with a dust kicking stomp. Leaving the Orcs in the dust. Pelk, behind his minion, folded his arms with a smug grin. With one quick swipe... The orcs had the Wrathguard down. Pelk made a quick and totally planned out sprint to the remaining prisoners. "If I can't teach them how to properly punish them, then they don't deserve to keep them!" Once he reached them, he removed their bindings with his dagger and escorted them away as the militia completly mauled and dismembered the Wrathguard. "Now get out of here you freaks. Next time, pick better captors." Thankful and confused, the Orcs went on their way. Returning to where they came. Pelk? Pelk just walked away. No real direction or aim. He just left.
