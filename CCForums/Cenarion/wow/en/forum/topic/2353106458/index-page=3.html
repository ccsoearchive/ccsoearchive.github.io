(Posted by Jazzy in the Liko Missing Thread)<br/><br/>Jaszmin spent the night in Booty Bay at the Inn before taking the ship to Kalimdor. The missing Tauren was more likely to be hiding somewhere if he was not dead. Six months is a long time, he could be anywhere and likely even captured by some ambitious Theramore troops out on patrol.<br/><br/>She studied the layout of the land from high above on her gryphon, coasting on the thermals rising off the warm desert and deep cleft that scarred the land from Deathwings passage. She marveled at the power the huge dragon had and hoped she would not meet him as he continued to spread his fire across the area.<br/><br/>Landing at an Alliance outpost shortly before dusk, she made her way to the command tent and inquired about setting up camp on the fringe. Sitting around the camps fire she listened to the tales from half drunk troopers. She noticed they were all on edge and asked how they were faring in the aftermath of Deathwing. Hoping to spur some clues about the lost tauren.<br/>Too many tales were told and some were bound to be exaggerated. But she stored them in her memory and hoped to glean something truthful or useful.<br/><br/>One trooper in particular seemed to be boasting of killing more horde than anyone else and Jazzy smirked at his boasting, not counting it as anything of importance until he started talking about slaughtering kodos for sport. Listening to him she surmised that this was common practice among the Allied troops to lessen the available food and means of transport for the Tauren. One man even boasted killing a white calf and Jazzy felt all the alarms go off in her head. Something about the man needed further questioning and she waited. Soon all were asleep except for the night watch.<br/><br/>Jazzy bade the watch good night and walked casually off to her modest tent on the fringe of the camp. There she slipped into the shadows and crept towards where the boaster slept. Without a sound or disturbing his sleep she went through his things and found a carefully rolled up kodo skin. Even in the dark, it seemed to glow with a magical light of its own. Jazzy carefull scattered things about to make it look like an animal had snuck into camp and stolen the hide. Most were so drunk she doubted they would have heard a kodo stomp into camp.<br/><br/>Tucking the hide into her bags she packed her gryphon just as dawn approached and waved at the guards as she took off into the early light. Now to find out if a white kodo hide would interest the Ishnu Por Ah.<br/>

(Posted by Tacey in the Liko Missing Thread)<br/><br/>Tacey slid the letter from the small stack on her desk with surprise and delight. The AAMS seal was tinted red, for the horde office, but she was always glad to hear from her friends in the courier service. As a postman's daughter, she regarded her days as a courier fondly, and tried to maintain the connection for the benefit of Gentyl and the rest of the order. Her grin faded quickly as she scanned the contents of the letter.<br/><br/>Tacey,<br/><br/>Enclosed is a copy of a notice about a missing Tauren. Liko Farstrider is a friend of mine. I don't know much more that what's in the poster for now, I'll update you when I know more, but I wanted to get you started sifting your contacts as soon as possible. I won't tell you your business, but try to keep your head down on this one until we know what's going on -- I might just be getting paranoid in my old age, but the Barrens isn't the place it used to be, and I never rule out foul play. You may consider this an officially sanctioned mission from the AAMS, and may forward expenses to the alliance branch offices.<br/><br/>Best of luck, <br/>Spinock<br/><br/>Behind the note was a copy of a poster for a missing tauren. Tacey recognized the name and description from a notice Gentyl had been asking for volunteers to help post around town recently. Tacey had been skeptical, worried about the reaction from the town guard and the king's officials, but hadn't thought too much more about it. Now she was getting the same notice through AAMS channels, and from an old warhorse like Spinock. She respected the old bull, and a friend of his was worth sticking her neck out for, sight unseen. <br/><br/>Rolling the parchments up and stuffing them into her pack, she slipped out the back door of the barracks and headed for Old Town. She suspected she'd have to make the trip to Southern Barrens, and maybe Theramore, to talk to the troops on the line. But after several months, that trail was no doubt cold. Tacey still knew a couple of guys in the SI:7 offices, and they owed her a few favors. Their spies might sooner stab you than give you the time of day -- Tacey knew, she'd worked as one during the war in Icecrown -- but the analysts and clerks were the ones who really knew things, and Tacey had always made it a point to be the one with a heavy coin purse when they went out drinking after work. Her grin returned for a moment. It wasn't a pleasant situation, and with relations with the Horde getting worse by the day she'd have to be careful, but nothing made her day like having a new assignment.

(Posted by Winterstar in the Liko Missing thread)<br/><br/>Smoothing an errant feather in his purple plumage, the lone avian settled in comfortably in the lofty branches of Nordrassil. He clicked a few times in appreciation fo the magnificent vista before him, then traded one mantle of feathers for another, rising slowly into his kaldorei guise. Slowly, careful not to lose it, he pulled a single precious feather from a pouch at his waist. With Avianna back in the world of the waking, such talismans were much easier to come by. Within his mind's eye he recalled her scream as her death destroyed so many of the legion, and offered a small thank you to the winds that the Ancients had seen it fit to return at long last.<br/><br/>Yet feathers from allies and the mist of memories was not why he was here. As he swayed in the bough of the high tree, his thoughts turned to the urgent requests for a lost father, and the pleadings of a son. Golden eyes blinked in solitude as he considered himself, recently chanting the litany of the fallen during the Lunar Festival, a single tear shed for a daughter recently lost to the necessities of war.<br/><br/>It was not necessarily in his nature to assist the horde.<br/><br/>It was not necessarily in his nature to leave any sentient being without a sense of closure.<br/><br/>Reaching into his Dreamtime self, he began to chant softly. Sparks of essence danced in the feathers of his mantle as he began to focus his will and mindset into the sacred feather he held in his hands. skimming just a little of the latent geomantic energies around the world tree, he gathered his will into a singular pulse centered on the feather. Sweat gathering at a furrowed brow in concentration, the ancient druid released all of this into the air, his whim <br/>and will made manifest.<br/><br/>And then Winterstar was still.<br/><br/>They began arriving slowly, roosting in the tree in ones and twos. Subconsciously, the night elf traced the old rhymes in his mind: "One for sorrow, two for joy, three for a girl, four for a boy, five for silver, six for gold, seven for a secret never to be told..." The druid smiled inwardly. as one who listened to the most Resplendent of Whispers, he especially loved that latter one. <br/><br/>The parliament had gathered, often croaking, clicking, and watching the druid gathered at the center of the high reaches of the canopy of the most holy tree. Birds of several species were represented, though with a strong favoring of corvidae. On one hand, like called to like. On the other, the missing tauren was said to be decorated with the feathers of a raven. In its most simple, this was basic sympathetic magic.<br/>Beginning to work his will upon the ancient talisman once more, he began to implant the knowledge he had gained of the missing tauren into the avian minds around him. As he worked, he began reaching to them in spell song, knowing that while he was a sparkly object, that the assembled would need more to old their attention long enough to complete the magical working.<br/><br/>With a smile, his voice carried into the far reaches of the tree.<br/><br/>"Come on your wings so swift afar<br/>Gathering 'round this ancient Star. <br/>Birds from the land in wonderous flight<br/>Implored you serve this Winter's Night.<br/><br/>I'll tell you ye birds why come ye here, <br/>a Tree of life held most dear. <br/>Quickly to seek the Tauren Liko, <br/>for his fate his son to know. <br/><br/>Rooks and Ravens, Birds of the sky, <br/>time for your evening flight is nigh. <br/>Seek ye the place where Liko doth dwell. <br/>Return with news All Well! all Well!<br/><br/>Return with news All Well! All Well!"<br/><br/>With the final words uttered, the spell was complete. The myriad corvidae and other assorted avians took flight, as a very drained Winterstar leaned heavily against the world tree.<br/>Perhaps they would return with news he could pass on to others.<br/><br/>He groused as he began an incantation to return to Moonglade. He was getting too old for this.<br/><br/>(( With deepest apologies and deepest affection for the poets that went before. ))<br/>

(Posted by Zherron in the Liko Missing thread)<br/><br/>Flying swiftly from Moonglade, Zherron landed high in the boughs of Teldrassil, landing near the gateway to Rut'theran. His timing was good - his target was coming towards it on all fours, fast. "Amendera!" he said quickly, halting her. He swapped out of his bird form, then back into human form.<br/><br/>"Packleader?" Amendera Kynes looked surprised, remaining in her worgen form - her mane wild, her teeth bared. "Good to see you! I didn't realize you were in Darnassus."<br/><br/>"Just arrived...bit of a long flight from Moonglade. Privileges of druidism." Zherron smiled a bit, but then became somber. "Listen to me carefully. Are you still headed for Stonetalon?"<br/><br/>"Word just went out that they need people to fight off Horde marauders," Amendera replied, nodding. "What's up?"<br/><br/>"I've just heard something in Stormwind, going around courtesy of the Messenger Service. Apparently they're looking for people on both sides to find a missing person. Tauren, I think they said. Disappeared in the Barrens not long ago." Zherron pulled a pipe from his vest and lit it, puffing thoughtfully as he read his lieutenant's expression. "I know you're wary of the Horde because of the Forsaken. Light knows I am too. But if you're going to be in the area anyway, keep your eyes peeled. The hunter may have ended up in Stonetalon. Check the place out as much as your orders from the field commander permit." <br/><br/>Before Amendera could speak, Zherron raised a warning finger. "Since you're fighting the Horde, don't let slip that you're looking for a missing tauren, since most of the field commanders are from Stormwind, and they seem to be of the shoot-first-ask-later variety."<br/><br/>Amendera nodded. "I'll do my best, Packleader."<br/><br/>"I know you will, child. Go swiftly."<br/>

He was the kind of man, in another place and time, Gentyl might have been attracted to. There were no games here. He was a fighter. He either liked you or he didn't like you and he made no secret of which category your fell in. And, while he might play head games with his enemies, he wasted no time doing so with friends. The brutal honesty was refreshing. With him Gentyl didn't need to measure her words for fear of offending someone, nor did she need to reassure his ego.<br/><br/>"Hello, Leo."<br/><br/>"Gentyl, I wondered if I might see you given the news."<br/><br/>She looked around the inn, taking stock of the customers and then sat down with her back to the wall across from the elf. "News travels fast."<br/><br/>He nodded and took another drink. "How may I be of use to you in this? What do you plan to do?"<br/><br/>"Get her back, of course. I'm just not sure of the best way. That's why I hoped to find you."<br/><br/>"I do not imagine you are in a rush to harm more of your kin, nor join Deathwing in his wreckage. Negotiations are the simpler answer."<br/><br/>She slid some coins across the table to Joachim and squeezed the quarter of lemon into the tea. "That's the route I'm pursuing at the moment, but I need to know if there are any other options out there I am missing. Something that I haven't thought of and I trust your judgment."<br/><br/>He leaned forward, steepling his fingertips before his face. "There were five of us, following a trail in Stranglethorn. Trolls. Ambushed at a turn in the river, three of us managed to escape. At our camp that evening, the head of one of the others was delivered in a sack, and the fingers of the remainder."<br/> <br/>Gentyl blanched and set her cup down harder than she intended, spilling the tea.<br/><br/>"It was a message. They would let him live if we would forsake our dogged pursuit." He sighed evenly through his nose, squinting in thought. "So Larcen and I followed their own scout's trail to their haven, retrieved Ryans, and set them to flame."<br/> <br/>Leo was right. They should track Faithe down and take her back. Gentyl had already set scouts on her trail, but there was still a possibility of negotiating her back. It was a fine line to walk.<br/><br/>"Negotiations are a noble arrow, fired at an ignoble target," he said, almost as if he could read her mind. "If you believe the word of the Ishnu, that they will return your girl, by all means. Tactics can be rearranged.<br/>Gentyl took another sip of tea and thought about what was in front of her. "I trust Red Earth to do as she has promised. They've offered to exchange her for information on troop movements. The problem is, if the horde councils intervene, she may have to give the girl up."<br/><br/>Leo nodded solemnly, fingering the tabard on the table. "She has a gentle touch. It would seem that not all of the blood on this tabard belonged to one being. With Red involved, I imagine the stains to be... false."<br/><br/>"The messenger who delivered it said she had been examined by a healer and was fine. I believe the blood is from others.<br/><br/>"Indeed so. Continue with negotiations. If you must, divulge tactical information. It is a small price. The Inquisition will... shield this matter from the Warchief's sight, and that of his council."<br/><br/>Gentyl twisted the cup in her hands and frowned. "I will not give up information."<br/><br/>"Consider it only as a last resort. A safety net."<br/> <br/>Gentyl shook her head. "I already sent word that was not an option."<br/><br/>Leo raised his brow and nodded. "If negotiations are out of the way... a tactical insertion may be in order."<br/><br/>"Negotiations haven't failed yet. I just declined their first offer."<br/><br/>He smiled and leaned back in his chair. "Well there you are. Find a middle ground, or distract them with one hand and slap with the other. Were time not an issue, I would go retrieve her myself. That would require the likes of Cyrus, who is yet recovering. I cannot join any undertaking, nor any of my agents..."<br/><br/>This was not the response she wanted to hear. "When will you be available?"<br/><br/>Leothindas sighed gently. "For the next two hours or so. And then... Night Warrior only knows."<br/><br/>"Seriously?"<br/><br/>"Well. More seriously, I will return in a year and half's time. But yes. I've got two hours open." He pushed back further in his chair, pausing to rub at the dark circles beneath his eyes. "Mm. Tick tock."<br/><br/>Gentyl looked confused. "Tick tock?"<br/><br/>He frowned a bit deeper than usual, turning his tired stare upon her. "My time runs short, at least. I apologize for not being of extreme use to you in this uncomfortable situation. If nothing else, try to keep your spirits about you." His ear flicked to familiarly light hoof-steps, and peered grumpily over his shoulder. "Poem, dear. I have a task for you. My crypt. I am charging you with occupying it. Else the warlocks will believe it neglected and fill it once again with their... product." He turned his wrist upward, tapping on it. A holographic display binged lightly. "...be careful with that, Lady D'Amond."<br/><br/>

Taelanas joined Gentyl at the table in the Recluse. Worry creased his brow as she was sure it did hers, but she tried to focus on something positive. "Did you get settled in?"<br/><br/>He smiled. "I'd be content with a place in the stable out of the rain, so I'm quite content."<br/><br/>She dropped the coins in Joachim's hand for the tea. "Another cup for Tael, please and dinner for two."<br/><br/>"Hmm, yes. Amerae didn't realize we had rooms and has been sleeping in the library. I think she was more ecstatic with the desk and bookshelves than the bed."<br/><br/>Taelanas laughed and poured a cup of tea.<br/><br/>Zaium leaned against the counter nearby, taking slow heavy breaths though his mask. Even though Zaium owned the inn, he wasn't always around. Imperon must be coming in.<br/><br/>The sound of heavy boots on the puncheon floors announced his arrival with a full press of bodyguards. He joined them at the table while his guards fanned our around him. "What plans might you have for getting your priestess back, lady Gentyl? Have those who took her made any ransom demands or the like?"<br/> <br/>Gentyl looked across the darkened room where Jacksen opened a third book, which he placed on top of the opened book to his right, and then sipped his coffee. He was always studying. If only he could study out the pieces of this puzzle. "I got the first offer last night," she replied at last.<br/><br/>Imperon looked surprised. "So quickly? It almost sounds like...well, what was the offer?"<br/> <br/>Gentyl poured more tea into the cup and then squeezed another lemon wedge into the brew. "They will return her in exchange for someone named Liko or in exchange for me giving them information on alliance troop movements."<br/><br/>"Troop movements? That's an invitation for them to stumble into an ambush, that is. We can give them 'movements' that will guarantee they'll be where we want them, when we want them there."<br/><br/>Gentyl didn't respond. The offer didn't appeal to her. Instead, she shifted her gaze back to Jacksen. He dabbed his quill in the vial of ink before starting the next paragraph and went back to writing.<br/><br/>Imperon smiled. "That's not a bad deal, now that I think on it, lady Gentyl. Lie to the enemy, get your person back, and then get to kick the enemy in the teeth with our boots on."<br/><br/>She sighed at his eagerness. "Well, if it were me, I would make sure the information were reliable before I exchanged the prisoner. If it weren't the prisoner would be forfeit."<br/>

"Oh aye, the information has to be reliable. It's what troops the information is about that'll make the difference.<br/><br/>Taelanas stared at Imperon in surprise. "You think they would give the girl up without confirmation of truth?"<br/><br/>"I'm sure Red Earth can figure this out if I can," Gentyl sai.<br/><br/>"You say 'escort for General Soandso' and what it actually means is a false general with more guards than it looks like and backup nearby. They'll see a man who appears to be a general. They'll see his guard...and once they've engaged, they'll see the reinforcements."<br/><br/>"And then have the poor girl killed for the treachery?" Taelanas huffed.<br/><br/>"Personally, I think the request for information was a trick," Gentyl said.<br/><br/>Imperon nodded. "Possibly, but they can hardly back out of it now can they? They set the terms, after all."<br/><br/>"They can back out just as easily I would think," Taelanas said.<br/><br/>"Red Earth knows me. I think she's smart enough to think it would be used as bait."<br/><br/>Imperon reached up to scratch at his beard. "Um, lady Gentyl...if she knows you, she knows that trickery isn't your style. Then again, she'd also know that you wouldn't betray the Alliance. <br/><br/>"Exactly. So why would she think I would exchange information for one of my men?"<br/><br/>"This Liko individual must be quite valuable to them. In which case, we should definitely try to lay hands on him if we can. I'll have my people start digging for information. Were you given any information about this individual other than a name?"<br/><br/>She shrugged. "I've never heard of them. I haven't a clue."<br/><br/>"Doesn't give us a lot to go on. Were you told how to contact them? If so, see what else they'll tell you. My people are good...but I certainly couldn't even guess how many people named 'Liko' there might be."<br/><br/>Gentyl pondered the situation. Smoke drifted down from the balcony where someone enjoyed a cherry scented tobacco. Across the room, Jacksen mumbled in frustration, scratched something out, and continued writing.<br/><br/>"Who knows, but how many can be named Liko and have connections to the Ishnu?" asked Taelanas.<br/><br/>Imperon eyed Taelanas. "I don't know how traditional a name it is. Could be many. Do you have some idea about that?"<br/><br/>Taelanas shrugged. "Who knows?”<br/><br/>"I'm thinking it's a troll," she said. "Not sure why. <br/><br/>"I'll send that along as a "might be" when I get my people looking into it. We'll see what the help can dig up."<br/><br/>"I'll pay for your time," she said. "I may be mining for the next ten years, but we'll figure this out."<br/><br/>Imperon drummed his fingers on the table, deep in thought. "Depending on who Liko is...we may be able to take our payment from them. Depends on who they are, and what they know."<br/><br/>"Are we sure she's all right?" Taelanas asked.<br/><br/>"She was all right last night," she replied. "Ishnu brought in a healer to check her, but Sathrasa said it was actually a warlock."<br/><br/>Taelanas frowned, clearly perplexed. "Who is Sathrasa?"<br/><br/>"One of Imperon's guards."<br/>

"Imperon's Guards were there too?" Taelanas said clearly confused. "I'm sorry, I think I just got lost."<br/><br/>Gentyl flinched when Jacksen grumbled, crumpled up the piece of parchment and threw it over his shoulder. The paper caught fire mid-air, and with a small flash was nothing but bits of ember by the time it touched the floor. Without missing a beat, Jacksen slid another leaf from his sleeve and continued scribbling lines of text in a flurry of motion.<br/><br/>"I think Sathrasa was just trying to help and didn't realize I already had the information," she replied. "I wasn't aware the goblin was a warlock, though. She said she has a contact horde side who bought information about the goblin.<br/><br/>"You suspect she was harmed by the goblin?" Taelanas asked.<br/><br/>It was a question Gentyl had pondered much since Sathrasa approached her and one for which she had no answer. "No, I don't think Red Earth would allow her to be harmed while Faithe is under her protection."<br/><br/>"Then, what is the significance?"<br/><br/>"That I don't know, Tael, but there's a reason a warlock was examining her."<br/><br/>"The lady Gentyl would not allow me to send more than just a couple."<br/><br/>"I hired Cyrus," she said. "Professor Six showed up to take notes. I also had Moa and Fallenrose there. Regent Tenwit protected Professor Six."<br/><br/>Imperon nodded. "Six brought news of the defeat to us, as she was ordered to do. Her intervention helped make sure we were ready when the portal keep got hold of Cyrus.<br/><br/>Kolli looked down at the mention of Cyrus, thumb idly toying with the handle of her axe, other balled into a fist.<br/><br/>Zaium fell foward on the counter from his leaning position. As he pushed himself back up the sound of machinery chortling and popping drifted over the sounds of muted conversations. "I... I think I should be goin'.... power's runnin' low..."<br/><br/>Teriis quietly took a seat after managing to convey his want for a glass of water from Joachim. He sat quietly, hugging a tattered shawl tightly around his shoulders.<br/><br/>Imperon sat quietly, allowing the other two at the table to talk. He looks thoughtful, using one finger to scratch at his beard.<br/><br/>"Ah. So. Have you decided what you will offer Ma'am?" Taelanas asked.<br/><br/>She sighed. "I have a little gold and I put the guild hall up for sale."<br/><br/>Imperon frowned. "It doesn't sound like her captors want gold.<br/><br/><br/>Teriis fidgeted a bit and then stared at her with eyes wide, verging on fright.<br/><br/>Taelanas blinked. "Excuse me? You put the guild hall up for sale? And what do you council Mr. Showdah?"<br/><br/>Imperon gazed at her as if trying to decide if she were serious. "That...seems a bit extreme. With a little time and some intelligence work, I'm sure I can reclaim her without the need for selling anything. Her captors will pay...but you won't have to."<br/><br/>"I've already had someone offer to level the Barrens for me." <br/><br/>"Someone who commands the forces I do, lady Gentyl?" <br/><br/>"No offense, Imperon, but I can't afford your prices and I won't be in debt to you."<br/>

"It is certainly not my decsision, I do not even hold proper rank in your order, but more destruction seems... inflamatory."<br/><br/>"I have asked the other to hold their wardogs also, Tael. For now, I don't think razing the Barrens is the answer. If harm befalls her, then I may change my mind."<br/><br/>He sighed in relief.<br/><br/>Imperon huffed. "Did I say a word about charging?

I'd happily put that policy to use."<br/><br/>Taelanas voiced the same thing many others had several times before. "Imperon, forgive the impertanace, but why the generosity? It is not something that I would have expected from you. Where is your gain?"<br/><br/>He answered smoothly, without pause, but she always felt there was more behind the generosity and it made her nervous. Imperon would be the wrong person to be in debt to. "My troops need the exercise and I can be rest assured that when Gentyl calls for action, it's not something that will need to weigh on my conscience."<br/><br/>"I believe we can rake up a sizable ransom that will solve this peacefully," she responded.<br/><br/>"The money will simply be used to finance more war, lady Gentyl. Besides, giving in to the demands of kidnappers only encourages that sort of behavior."<br/><br/>Ciellia watched as Teriis stood, walking timidly to Gentyl and handing her the note. He still had his ragged shall clutched around his shoulders. She wanted desperately to find a way to break him out of his shell, but he was almost feral in some aspects. The only way to reach him was to show him small acts of kindness and let the trust build over time. Now, with the death of his father, he had retreated further into the shell and she didn't know what to do to build his confidence.<br/><br/>Gentyl looked up at Teriis who nodded at the note, encouraging her to open it. You always spoke poorly of Imperon for watching you. For Faithe's sake, maybe it's time you put his obsession to use? For Faithe?<br/><br/>Kolli slowly looked over to Teriis, fingers waving and hands ready. She was one of Imperon's more enthusiastic guards. Seriously? She thought Teriis was a danger to anyone?<br/><br/>Teriis folded his hands in front of him, looking at Gentyl curiously.<br/><br/>The entire table was watching her now. She looked surprised at the words and then frowned. His eyes were wide with hope when she looked up. "No!" she said with more force than she had intended.

Teriis stifled a sigh, pointing at the last two words of the note before, stepping away from the group. He was right. She should use every tool at her disposal to retrieve Faithe, but she couldn't bring herself to use anyone, including Imperon.<br/><br/>"Perhaps I choose poorly, but it will by my conscience and my man," she said, hoping Teriis would understand. He sighed and nodded sadly in response.<br/><br/>Imperon raised an eyebrow but didn't comment.<br/><br/>Gentyl sighed heavily, "Yes, Teriis, I know...and you are right, but I can't."<br/><br/>Teriis folds his arms, resting his chin on them.<br/><br/>"It doesn't matter," she said. "I already sent word back that if information is the price then Faithe is forfeit."<br/><br/>Imperon looked her for a long moment as if readying an argument and then simply nodded slowly. "Then we need to find this Liko. That's the bait for a proper trap."<br/><br/>Taelanas blanched but little else showed his reaction.<br/><br/>"That would be the next step, but if he is found, there will be no trap."<br/><br/>"So, we search every prisoner camp for members of Ishnu," Taelanas said.<br/><br/>Gentyl nodded and poured another cup of tea, then sliced a new lemon.<br/><br/>"That's a good place to start," said Imperon. "It's a good thing I have the intelligence division that I do. If there's information to be had about Liko, I'll have it before too long."<br/><br/>"I'm sure Red moved Faithe already so she could be anywhere," Gentyl said and squeezed some lemon in the tea.<br/><br/>"If she were one of mine, that wouldn't matter." Imperon grinned. "I don't like losing soldiers. I keep tabs on them."<br/><br/>Gentyl frowned at his grin. "Yes, I'm aware of how you keep tabs on people. I'm not you."<br/><br/>"You're not aware of how I keep track of my own people or the protections I have on them."<br/><br/>Ciellia smirked from behind her leader. "He does like to keep a close eye on us."<br/><br/>"Suffice it to say that it was only a scant few minutes after Cyrus fell in the Barrens that he was being aided by the best healers this side of a naaru within my infirmary."<br/><br/>"I seem to remember you popping up in the cell with Azurio regardless of the wards. I'm somewhat familiar."<br/><br/>"Oh yes, I do remember that. Indeed. Trying to keep one of my people imprisoned is useless. Do be a friend, lady Gentyl, and don't let on to that with the Watch. They still seem to thinkt hat their cells could be an impediment to my people."<br/><br/>Gods he was insufferable at times. "Well, it's too bad Faithe wasn't one of yours. I wouldn't have this problem."<br/><br/>His smile was more of a taunt than anything else. "I often bemoan how sad it is that more people haven't seen to fit to swear themselves to my service. I'm glad to see you share a similar opinion."<br/>

"Their wards are probably better than what we improvised at the keep."<br/><br/>"Were better."<br/><br/>Of course. He would have put sorcerers to work on the problem in the Stockades soon after his men were taken. She had doubts that even he could circumvent all of them, however.<br/><br/>Taelanas slapped his hand on the table. "This is useless talk. The topic at hand, please."<br/><br/>"I was being sarcastic, Imperon. Faithe wouldn't last a day in your company."<br/><br/>Imperon giggled. It was an unsettling sound, something she often thought bordered on something insane. She glanced at Taelanas in approval. It was never a good thing to get too far off the track with Imperon. "I'm going to call in some old friends to do some scouting. Imperon, I don't want your men steamrolling the Barrens."<br/><br/><br/>"You do that. We can compare notes whenever it pleases you to meet again."<br/><br/>A messenger walked into the inn and paused, no doubt waiting for his eyes to adjust to the dark. Then he spotted her, walked over and leaned down to whisper in her ear. She nodded and handed him some coins. "Someone is coming to look at the guild hall tomorrow."<br/><br/>Teriis frowned, and pulled his shawl closer. The guards wouldn't like the move, but the new place was beautiful and she would be free of Imperon's attempts to watch over her.<br/><br/>Imperon smiled. "So Have you warned them that your hall is haunted?" <br/><br/><br/>Ciellia lowered her head onto the bar and quietly sighed. The druidess preferred her cat form in the inn and tonight was no exception.<br/><br/>"My hall isn't haunted." <br/><br/>Imperon cocked his head to the side as if surprised she doubted him. "Yes it is...As of...about an hour from now."<br/><br/>She took another sip of tea, refusing to rise to the bait. "if it were, it might be worth more. People like that kind of stuff." <br/><br/>"Not this sort of haunt."<br/>

Taelanas looked incredulous. "Are you threatening to haunt the hall?"<br/><br/>"You're testing my patience," she said and took another sip of tea. "and I have damned little tonight."<br/><br/>"This sort will drive your property value down excessively, or so I've heard. You may just have to abandon plans to move out."<br/><br/>She set the cup down and leveled her gaze on him. "Don't threaten me or I'll blow it to pieces and invite you to watch."<br/><br/>"I'm not threatening... How could I command a haunting? I'm no necromancer." He shrugged. "Hauntings just happen sometime. It's inexplicable."<br/><br/>Teriis stared between the two of them.<br/><br/>"Yet you can predict them down to the hour? What a gift sir!" Taelanas was as impressed as she was.<br/><br/>Duessel had been quiet up to now, as he usually was but he spoke up. "He has necromancer-types under his control."<br/><br/>"You're not helping, Deuce," she said. <br/><br/>Duessel let out a hacking cough, but she was pretty sure he was hiding a grin.<br/><br/>She turned her attention back to Imperon. "Yes, well, just in case my hall gets haunted, I'll have a blowing up party and invite you."<br/><br/>Imperon shrugged a shoulder. "Ghosts often become agitated when ownership of their resting place changes." Then he turned to Taelanas. "Of course I can predict a haunting. I know the ghosts are there, and once they know you plan to sell the place, it will likely cause a disturbance. Ghosts are temperamental like that."<br/><br/>She glared at him. "Not tonight, Imperon. Don't screw with me tonight. Not in the mood."<br/><br/>Teriis' eyes widened in shock as he stared at her.<br/><br/>Taelanas laughed. "So you are an authority on ghosts?"<br/><br/>Imperon smiled at them. <br/><br/>Gentyl pushed her tea away and stood up before she did something she'd regret later. She could hear Imperon's men laughing as she stormed out of the inn.<br/><br/>Taelanas followed her out the door. "I dont know why you got them involved to begin with Ma'am, but it seems to have backfired."<br/><br/>She kicked a rock off the path. "Gah, that man. No wonder he always has several guards around when he meets with me. I always wind up wanting to choke him."<br/><br/>Taelanas nodded. "He has that effect. I think he does it on purpose.<br/>

He bowed his head in a subservient manner. "But, I forget my place."<br/><br/>"It is your place to offer advice and I think you're correct. I think the key is to find this Liko."<br/><br/>He watched the people with their orphans running up to the ice cream vendor to buy treats. "Then, for what it is worth, I would devote your energy towards Liko."<br/><br/>"Yes, but where to start."<br/><br/>"Imperon will still likely search for him to yet set his trap, or any other plan he forms. So, what is the move? I do not know where prisoners are kept. I have never taken any."<br/><br/>"Stockades, but I've been there recently. There were no horde prisoners."<br/><br/>"Then perhaps closer to the front."<br/><br/>Duessel walked out of the inn and looked around, finally spotting her and walking over. "You aren't too pissed off are you?"<br/><br/>"About what?" she asked.<br/><br/>"You walked out in a bit of a huff..."<br/><br/>"Imperon has that effect on me. It's a gift."<br/><br/>5/5 00:11:34.031 Gentyl says: Teriis<br/><br/>Teriis slipped out the door and nodded politely, holding his shawl closely<br/><br/>"Are you all right?"<br/><br/>He nodded quickly at her.<br/><br/>"Are you returning to the barracks? I wish you would. It's not safe out here with that serial killer loose."<br/><br/>Teriis rubbed the back of his neck, shrugging. She raised an eyebrow at him. He sighed and offered a timid wave before heading toward the barracks. He was probably afraid to sleep there now since Imperon had threatened a haunting.<br/><br/>Duessel walked over to the ice cream vendor to buy and ice cream bar. He nibbled at the edges and grinned. "You guys should really try that place. Dont know what they do, but its geeeeeeewwwwd ice cream. The bars especially. I learned my lesson with the slushie though. Brain freeze." His tongue flicked out to catch some ice cream dribbling down his chin. "Anywho. See you two around."<br/><br/>They watched him carefully mount his drake while juggling the remnants of the ice cream bar. <br/><br/>"Now that is the man you should have hired to protect Faithe I think," said Taelanas. "I will see to some preparations. Unless there is anything you would like to discuss. We must move with alacrity if we hope to find this Liko first."<br/>

It was nearly dusk when she felt the thunder of an approaching group. Large by the sound and feel. <br/><br/>Finally, they were going to let her go.<br/><br/>Unfamiliar voices rose in anger at the gate, but there was nothing in common speech. She crept closer to the tent door, hoping to catch a snatch of conversation, but she could only glean the occasional word. <br/><br/>The urge to peek out almost overwhelmed her, but the fear of being seen was greater and she remained just to the side of the door. She leaned back against the hide tent so tight she felt the seam against her back. Then she realized if the visitors were hostile they might see the bulge through the tent and stab her in the back. She scooted forward just a bit and leaned down.<br/><br/>Light don't let them look in here.<br/><br/>The voices were getting closer...and louder.<br/><br/>Snow curled up in her lap and looked up at Faithe as if she too were frightened.<br/><br/>"Shhh," Faithe stroked the kitten.<br/><br/>One of the guards reached in the tent and grabbed her by the hand, pulling her to her feet. Another grabbed her bags and followed them out of the tent.<br/><br/>An orc with his back to her turned around as they approached. He stopped talking to the warrior in front of him when he recognized Faithe.<br/><br/>The guard holding her hand clutched her tighter when her knees buckled.<br/><br/>Rua.<br/><br/>"I told you never come back," he said.<br/><br/>She shook her head and frowned as if she didn't understand.<br/><br/>He shrugged. "Play games. I don't care." A guard led Cinder up to him and he pointed his hand at the mare.<br/><br/>"Please, you can't let him take me," she held fast to the guard who looked confused at the unfamiliar words, but understood her fear. He peeled her hand away from his arm and looked up at the bluff behind the camp.<br/><br/>She followed his gaze. Archers lined the crest, arrows trained on them. Faithe let her hands drop. No one would attempt to fight them, especially for a human they didn't want there in the first place.<br/><br/>A guard tied her bags to the saddle. Snow jumped up in her arms when she mounted and looked out at the guards with wide eyes. She hissed at one who walked to close.<br/><br/>Faithe looked around once more, hoping one of the Ishnu would object, but none were there. Only the gate guards stood around uneasily in a circle.

((Posted by Tohatsu))<br/><br/>To: AAMS Horde branch Headquarters:<br/><br/>I am writing this report to let all AAMS couriers and officers know the state of communications in the current situation. <br/><br/>The meetings between a guild from the Alliance side and the one from the Horde side are real touchy and tense. I did my best to translate the words of Sister Red Earth. I refrained from mentioning any of the other comments from her entourage. I did this out of respect for Sister Red Earth. There were a lot of comments that if translated would have led to a blood bath, and I had to bite my tongue on sometimes. I do not want to be in the middle of a fight when we are dedicated to remaining neutral.<br/><br/>There still seems to be some tension in the Ishnu Por Ah towards our services, though I was treated well and no threats were made to me. I offered my help in finding the missing Tauren as well, though there is nothing to report on that as yet.<br/><br/>I continue to train and look forward to more menial tasks, as my heart is still thumping after staring at a rather large death knight with cold blue eyes. I do not want to run into that one and have him mistake me for an enemy!<br/><br/>Respectfully, <br/><br/>Courier Tohatsu<br/>

Concerning The Letter Found In The Barrens On The Person Of An Orc Courier, <br/><br/>I regarded one thing in particular about this letter, it was sealed not with wax, but bitumen. Before the great upheaval, this was rare, but since then surface deposits of bitumen have risen in abundance. The tauren have taken advantage of this. The sealing of letters with bitumen is never practiced in man or elfkind, they rely on wax or ground cinnabar, with a few houses employing more luxurious practices. What is more: bitumen is not all bitumen--that is to say, the deposits found in the barrens, when put under certain magical luminescence, will describe a singular purple sheen. Observe…<br/><br/>Now, to the letter itself. There are four principal totemic codices in the tauren language, all of which are well known to gnome scholars. The tauren, to their credit, are not disposed to treachery as a norm, and they have never succeeded in a means of correspondence that is entirely inscrutable. As the son of a renowned linguist and cryptographer who served the alliance for many years, I can speak to their want of talent in this theatre. It is infallible: A key is always found in one of the four major codices, and that, you will see, is the case with the Barrens Letter. Concerning the substrate, it’s origin too is clearly affixed to tauren custom, especially when communicating without their society, as we will see this missive is clearly aimed. The parchment, I have validated with an eminent Stormwind stationer, is the heavy linen and vegetable pulp composition used by the more learned tauren tribes. I have taken no liberty in translation, stretched no word; it is true as ever an expression can be when traveling from one tongue to another. And this is what it reads…<br/><br/><em>A-<br/><br/>You understand the hazard this brings to me and my House, as I know that you will observe absolute confidence in our arrangement. We confirm that the human is a maiden, with hair of a remarkable silver hue. These qualities, and what little effort has been asked of you, make this largess far exceed our debts to your House. Let this be considered full satisfaction of our due, and naught more be heard of it. If the orcs meet no misfortune, you will have her by first light.<br/><br/>We will purchase what time we are able, but know that the alliance blood is hot. It is wise that you execute your purpose with all alacrity.<br/><br/>Let no more be said of this. And let me know nothing of her fate.<br/><br/>-R</em><br/><br/>The seal is unmistakable. It is the sigil of the Ishnu Por Ah. The author is Redearth. We have confirmed that the Ishnu owed a considerable sum to the Grim Maw. It chills me to say, we believe the letter was intended for none other than, Abominus.<br/><br/>I have taken it upon myself to approach the study of this document with great care, hoping with all my heart I would find some evidence to discredit it. No such evidence has risen, nor will it. It is as certain as the sun will rise tomorrow, the author of these cold words is Redearth. Her confidence has played against her, the misfortune that befell one of her personal carriers at the hands of the centaur is entirely unexpected. The fortune of my own Practical Marico of the Tenth Legion happening upon this courier at his end should well be considered an act of Light’s intervention; for we can, once and for all, now know the true countenance of this tauren leader. The same hand that so easily sends our dear Faithe into the dark unknown of the undead city to be the sport of Abominus. This very hand has composed a thousand artful letters of diplomacy, stuffed with fair promises. Now, the same tauren that claims to serve the children of her own people, settles her debts with by delivering our own innocent daughters to revenants. Are we so surprised? <br/><br/>This is the same tauren that summoned the powers of the firmament to strike down Ehlina Vargas after terms of accord were struck; no greater dishonor have I witnessed upon the field of battle.<br/><br/>Good Alliance, let us not be dup’d again; assign your hearts to action, there is no other course. <br/><br/>Saldor Tenwit<br/>Lord Regent of the Tenth Legion<br/><br/>p.s.<br/><br/>The Barrens Letter is in the care of the Tenth Legion. It can be reviewed upon request. Please allow one fortnight for us to answer your request. Please understand there will be a modest handling fee.<br/>

((Now that the pieces are in place, here's what's going to happen. Everyone can play. I am moving Faithe to her final destination, but people will need to find her trail. Starting Sunday night and each night thereafter, I will have a clue giver in place from 7-8 server time. The clue giver will be at each of the camps and will tell you what you see and which direction the party went.<br/><br/>But wait! There's more! If you can't be in the game at that time or you can't find the clue giver, just do your search and post here what you did. You can also try to catch me in game and give me your results ic. If you find the next camp, I will tell you ooc you found it. Gen, of course, has no idea where Faithe is.<br/><br/>If horde find the clue giver or do a search, I will also give them the clues and results of their search, but I'll have to mail them the next clue as I won't have translators there. The clue givers will tell me the names of the horde who find them so I can mail the clue.<br/><br/>This venue should allow anyone who wants to participate to do so.))

The dust and smoke filled the air as Jazzy flew recon over the Barrens. Baridin searched the ground for sign. After much searching they found a small camp. The ground was covered with tracks, and Baridin set out to make sense of it while Jazzy searched the tent.<br/><br/>In the murky depths of the tent Jazzu found a scrap of cloth with embroidery on it, the image of a centaur seemed to be the focus. As she stepped out into the sunlight, Baridin found a trail. With his keen hunter talents and the aid of his cat they were able to find signs of the trail heading north.<br/><br/>"Let's search for centaur camps in the area" Jazzy folded the scrap of cloth and stashed it in her pack to show Gentyl. Whistling for her cat she waited for Baridin to mount.
