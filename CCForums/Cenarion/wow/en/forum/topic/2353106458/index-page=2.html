(Posted by Faithe)<br/><br/>The bull sitting next to her lumbered to his feet when another tauren darkened the doorway. Two others stepped in and bound Faithe with magic. Even though they had already taken her weapon, they were making sure she presented no harm to the newcomer. This must be their leader.<br/><br/>The female bowed to her and Faithe responded. <br/><br/>A heated discussion ensued. Faithe caught a few words, but most of it flew by. Then there was silence as the flapping of wings signaled a new arrival. Faithe nearly wept with relief when the night elf male stepped up beside the tauren female and bowed to her.<br/><br/>"You're here to help me," Faithe blurted out.<br/><br/>"Yes, but only to translate. I can't take you home yet. I will get word to your people. My name is Dustwing"<br/><br/>Faithe tried to steady her shaking knees. <br/><br/>The tauren female started off with a barrage of questions, which the elf translated.<br/><br/>"Red Earth wants to know who you are and what you were doing here."<br/><br/>Faithe responded, trying to explain her concern for the orc parents who had raised her.<br/><br/>"If you were raised by orcs, why can't you speak orcish?"<br/><br/>"It's been a long time. I've forgotten."<br/><br/>"Why didn't you meet them in Ratchet, instead of invading our lands?"<br/><br/>Faithe sighed. "They are old. Mama is blind. It would be painful for Papa to ride that far. Please, I was only bringing supplies to them and I found their home burned down. Ask her if she knows where they are."<br/><br/>Red Earth scowled. At last Dustwing turned back to her. "I don't think she believes you, but she said they will look for the old ones."<br/><br/>Faithe caught onto a glimmer of hope. Maybe she could convince them she was of no value, which she wasn't, they would let her go. Lord Wolfgaar might ransom her out of pride, but it really wasn't his responsibility. "I'm not important to anyone. I'm not worth anything to anyone but Gentyl."<br/><br/>Red Earth's ears flicked forward in interest when Dustwing mentioned Gentyl. He turned to Faithe, "She wants to know what connection you have to Gentyl."<br/><br/>"I'm a Holy Guard," Faithe said. "Gentyl assigned me to the Manus Ignota as an ambassador."<br/><br/>Dustwing quickly translated. Red Earth frowned and pawed at the ground a bit with one hoof. <br/><br/>"Red Earth knows Gentyl. She doesn't like her much. She's a good fighter."<br/><br/>Faithe laughed in spite of herself. "Gods, she's a horrible fighter. She gets knocked out all the time. The only thing is she doesn't know when to stop. She's like a badger and won't give up." Faithe looked shocked at her own words. "Oh, Light, don't translate that. Gentyl probably wouldn't be happy to hear me say that if it gets back to her."<br/><br/>Dustwing laughed but nodded.<br/><br/>Red Earth looked between the two of them and frowned.<br/><br/>"She wants to know what we're talking about," Dustwing said.<br/><br/>Faithe sighed. "All right, tell her."<br/><br/>The two spoke a bit longer and then Dustwing bowed to them both. "She says they will keep you safe until she decides what to do with you. I have to return to Stormwind now."<br/><br/>A goblin female walked in and started examining Faithe. She motioned for Faithe to sit down.<br/><br/>"What does she want?" Faithe asked Dustwing.<br/><br/>"She's a healer from Da Doctas. "They want to make sure you aren't harmed."<br/><br/>Faithe sank to her knees reluctantly, while the goblin smiled, nodded and poked and prodded her. The female seemed very excited and Faithe wasn't entirely sure how much she knew about healing humans even if she were hurt.<br/><br/>When the female was through examining her, Faithe took off her tabard and handed it toward the elf. "Give it to Gentyl. She'll understand what it means."<br/><br/>Two guards stepped closer, but allowed him to take the tabard.<br/><br/>"Thank you, Dustwing."<br/><br/>"Elune keep you," she said and bowed. Then he was gone with a great flapping of wings and with him went the last of her hope.

(Posted by Furen)<br/><br/>"...and then Mama Red washed the black paint out of her fur and returned to Thunder Bluff," Furen was telling a circle of children. Most of them were tauren, their horns not even grown in yet, but there were also a few orcs and even a blood elf female, courtesy of Children's Week. Furen sat crosslegged and upwind of them, and had been laying out his substantial collection of stories--some true, some "embellished", and some complete kodo flop--with gusto to his rapt audience. He knew it was odd for a Forsaken, but he rather enjoyed the week he got to pick an eager little orc boy or girl and show him or her the world. It almost made him feel alive again...<br/><br/>"And once she returned to Thunder Bluff, she--oh, hello, Mama Red!" Furen sprang to his feet as he spotted Redearth--or at least, a tauren that LOOKED like Redearth. He took a moment to greet her in the traditional tauren way before launching into a tirade about a letter. He pulled said letter out of his belt pouch, and couldn't quite hide the AAMS letterhead as he held it up for her to see.<br/><br/>"It came from some Alliance person named Dustwing, forwarded to Yotingo, spent a while in our offices, and then forwarded to...me! Aren't you lucky?" The Forsaken grinned, flapping the paper. "Well, don't you want to see what it says?"<br/><br/>((Just had to. :D And, since I'm making some assumptions here, just say the word and I can change this to something else. ))<br/>

Gentyl was exhausted. She hadn't slept in two days, but she wanted to stop in the Recluse and see if Cyrus had returned yet. It was early and Faithe would probably want to stay a few day. Gentyl smiled. Knowing Faithe she would probably press everyone into action to repair the hut and property before they left. She wondering how Cyrus would look with a hoe in his hand, tending the tiny garden Faithe said they always kept.<br/><br/>For someone quiet and unassuming she had a remarkable gift for encouraging others to work. The escort would probably be glad to get home and rest in the practice yard.<br/><br/>Plus, she needed to check her mail. She smiled at the package from Faithe. The girl had spent her last days rushing around to make potions and mail them out for those who needed them. Gentyl was running out of bank space for them.<br/><br/>Gentyl walked over to the bar and ordered a pot of tea and opened the box while she waited. It was an old, bright pink cloth doll with long silver hair and a little ruffled dress. Gentyl knew the doll. Her orc mother had despaired of finding any dolls that looked like Faithe in the markets and had made her one. She had dyed the linen with some wildflowers that turned the cloth a most unappealing color and the old orc woman had cried, but Faithe insisted she loved that color and wanted a doll made of the cloth. When she was done with the doll, she then sewed Faithe and the doll matching dresses, each stitch carefully placed by hand in the bright sunlight. Even then her eyesight was failing. Faithe had taken the doll with her to the abbey when the old orcs were forced to give her up. <br/><br/>A note lay on top the doll. "Sophi will keep you company until I return. Don't get her dirty!"<br/><br/>She smiled and turned to a nearby table, setting down the teapot, cup, and package. <br/><br/>Ciellia sat at the other end, talking to a friend. "His heart wasn't beating when he arrived."<br/><br/>Gentyl pulled out a chair. "Whose heart wasn't beating?"<br/><br/>Ciellia's eyes narrowed, almost in accusation. "Cyrus. His heart was stopped for several minutes. We don't know if he'll recover."<br/><br/>Gentyl wilted into the chair. "I'm so sorry." Her hand shook as she poured some honey into the tea cup. "Any word of the others?"<br/><br/>Ciellia shook her head. <br/><br/>Gentyl clasped both hands around the cup and drank the steaming tea, trying to clear her mind. The citrus rind sharpened the scent while the honey soothed her aching throat. She hadn't eaten yet today and her stomach threatened to spill what little was in it. The honeyed tea soothed her enough to seize control. "I need to seek out some information," she said and started to stand. <br/><br/>A dust-covered courier strode into the inn and looked around, his gaze settling on her. "Lady Gentyl. I have an urgent message."<br/><br/>Dustwing was often serious, but his heavy green brows knit together now in a frown deep enough to plant. She didn't bother to protest the title. He nodded upstairs and she gathered her things, following him numbly.<br/><br/>"I've seen Faithe," he said as soon as they sat down.<br/><br/>"Is she all right?" <br/><br/>"She looked fine to me. She's frightened, but she's all right. The Ishnu have her and they called in someone from Da Doctas to look at her. The goblin says she's healthy."<br/><br/>"Why didn't you bring her back?" She took a sip of tea and stared into his eyes, searching for hidden messages.<br/><br/>"I was allowed to go in as a translator only. They're going to keep her until they determine what to do."<br/><br/>Gentyl nodded and set the cup down. "I see. What do they want for her? I don't have much gold, but I can raise some."<br/><br/>There. There was the catch in his eyes. He looked down. "One of the orcs wants her. Redearth said that is not their way. They don't keep slaves."<br/><br/>"But?"<br/><br/>"But they might be willing to trade her. There is someone named Liko missing. Find him and they might trade the girl for him. That or they might trade information. Give them word of Alliance troop movements in exchange for the girl."<br/><br/>Gentyl lifted the doll out of the box and stroked the silky hair. "I'll do what I can to find Liko, whoever that is. If information is the price, Faithe's life is forfeit. I won't trade one life for many."<br/><br/>Dustwing flinched. "I see. They might accept gold. I don't know."<br/><br/>"Gold I can get."<br/><br/>Dustwing stood up and bowed. "Lady Gentyl. I'm at your service."<br/><br/>"Please just take a message back to her. I want a meeting in person and I want AAMS translators."<br/>

Gentyl walked outside the inn and summoned Tawny. The gryphon swooped down from the air, snapping up a pigeon in her beak on her way. She tossed the dead bird in the air and gulped it down in one swallow, then turned a golden eye to Gentyl as if asking why she had been disturbed.<br/><br/>The boat seemed to take forever, but it always did when she was in a hurry. At last they were on dry land again and Tawny, gave that familiar squawk that seemed almost like a roar, and lifted into the air. Gryphons loved to fly and any other time, Gentyl would have settled in for a leisurely flight, but now she needed all the speed the bird could muster and she slapped the loose end of the reins at the gryphon.<br/><br/>A guard in the camp seemed to know who Gentyl was looking for and directed her to a nearby tent. "I'm looking for Fallenrose."<br/><br/>"Yeah, I guessed. Popular woman." He pointed again in the direction of the tent. <br/><br/>Fallenrose slowly opened her eyes and nodded when Gentyl sat down beside her and took her hand.<br/><br/>"Thank the Light you're alive," Gentyl said.<br/><br/>Fallenrose forced a smile. "Not that easy to..." She let the words trail off.<br/><br/>"To what? What happened to you?"<br/><br/>"We were attacked, overwhelmed when we were near the forgotten pools."<br/><br/>Gentyl looked over the wounds while Rose described what happened. There was a sword wound to the stomach and side. She was badly burned in several places and bruised all over as if someone had flung her down repeatedly.<br/><br/>"Her parents lived there. Did you not see them?"<br/><br/>Fallenrose took a moment to gather her thoughts. "We stopped at the ruins of an orc camp or village. I wasn't familiar with the place, but seemed to hold importance to the young priest."<br/><br/>"Ruins? That was their home."<br/><br/>"The village was in pieces. Looked like an attack, but by who we don't know."<br/><br/>Gentyl sighed heavily and rocked back on her heels. "So I nearly got three people killed for nothing."<br/>Fallenrose grimaced. "Never for nothing. Sometimes I think it's fate." She frowned. "Ishnu were there."<br/><br/>"Yes, I got a message from them. They have Faithe. Did hey just happen upon you?<br/><br/>Fallenrose shook her head slowly "I don't know, we weren't at the village long before they began to arrive."<br/><br/>"I think for now we should get you a sleeping potion. I'll see if we can get transport tomorrow if you feel like moving."<br/><br/>Fallenrose shook her head. "No potions please. With the pain I can at least know I am alive."<br/><br/>Gentyl disagreed with the logic, but didn't argue. "As you wish."<br/><br/>Potion or not, Fallenrose drifted back to sleep and Gentyl stood to leave. She left instructions with the medic and some supplies, then remounted Tawny and sped back to Stormwind. She had to check on Moa and Cyrus.

Imperon was waiting for her when she walked in the Recluse. "Good evening, lady Gentyl."<br/><br/>"Too tired to argue with you about the lady part," she replied. "How is Cyrus?"<br/><br/>"Good. You already know I'm too stubborn to change."<br/><br/>Imperon's guard Kolli slowly crossed her arms over her stomach, hips canted just a bit to make her axe handle hover a bit higher. Gentyl glanced up at her. "Surely you don't think I'm going to attack him."<br/><br/>"No, not at all. I'm just learning how to be sexy and deadly at the same time! Is the practice paying off?"<br/><br/>Imperon sighed.<br/><br/>"Yeah, well, save it for a different audience," Gentyl said, not in any mood for nonsense.<br/><br/>Kolli visibly flinched at Imperon's sigh and stood up straight.<br/><br/>Imperon returned to the question. "He's rather badly torn up. Broken bones, a concussion, various punctures and tears. But he's alive."<br/><br/>"You have the best healers," she said. "I trust he'll recover."<br/><br/>"One hopes. He was a bloody mess when they got him to our infirmary. So far as I'm aware, my clerics are still working on him."<br/><br/>Gentyl poured her tea. "Would you like something to drink, Imperon?"<br/><br/>"I'm fine, but thank you. I suspect, lady Gentyl, that you asked me here for more than to question Cyrus' physical condition? <br/><br/>She squeezed some lemon into the tea and stirred it absently, then looked across the room to the mage Jacksen frown at the scribblings on his page. Slightly frustrated he folded the paper several times until the paper is too thick to fold again.<br/><br/>"That's my concern. Even though he is your man, he was still in service to one of mine. It's my duty to see after him. I will, of course, pay all him medical expenses."<br/><br/>"Yes, "Imperon said, "I believe we covered you paying for expenses at our last meeting. A few dozen holes in my man qualify."<br/><br/>"Faithe is missing. I need to focus on that, but I will pay my debts."<br/><br/>Imperon nodded. "I've heard that. No fear on that count, lady Gentyl. We will find your missing priest. Our job isn't done until she's safely escorted."<br/><br/>"She was escorted. That's what I paid for."<br/><br/>"You paid for her safety. We haven't delivered on that yet, lady Gentyl. Our job isn't done until this girl is safely seen to her parents and back again."<br/><br/>Jacksen looked up from his book, and took a quick survey of the tavern. "When did all of these people get here?"<br/><br/><br/>

Wolfgaar strode into the Recluse and bowed low as he always did. The usual smile was replaced with a worried frown. "Lady Gentyl, may I have a moment of thine time?"<br/><br/>Gentyl inhaled deeply. Dear Light, let Moa be alive.<br/><br/>She followed him outside where he fired up the rocket he loved and she hated. It always felt like it was about to fall apart to her. He flew out over the hills surrounding Stormwind to a secluded glen. Below them she could see the soft glow of a campfire. He banked the rocket gently and landed near the fire. On the other side, an elf lay, swaddled in blankets like a new babe. His features were worn and sharp with pain.<br/><br/>Moadayd.<br/><br/>Wolfgaar bowed before "M'lord Moadayd, how art thou?"<br/><br/>Moadayd struggled to his feet, but Wolfgaar motioned him back down. "Sit, sit down, sir. Thou art not well and ought not be on thy feet."<br/><br/>"Moadayd, how are you?" Gentyl asked while Wolfgaar examined the bloody bandages.<br/><br/>"Not well, M'lady, but that is neither here nor there. Do you mind sitting while we chat?"<br/><br/>She nodded. It was easy to see just looking up was painful. "Have you had someone looking over you?"<br/><br/>Wolfgaar nodded. "Aye, hast thou a nurse or medic?"<br/><br/>"Lady Shar and Master Killerb did their best with me, but in the end it was my Mentor Coolgust that solve the issues."<br/><br/>"You shouldn't be out here alone," Gentyl said.<br/><br/>"I'm am fine now," Moadayd replied.<br/> <br/>"Marry!" wolfgaar exclaimed. "He ought not indeed. Tis not safe. What if he were attacked?"<br/><br/>"The elements are helping me more than you know."<br/> <br/>Wolfgaar frowned, but ceased objecting. "I must trust to it, sir."<br/><br/>"I beleive that you are not here to see how I am, but to hear what I have to say. Pardon my rudeness but the pain can be a bit much."<br/><br/>Gentyl flinched. This was the second time she had been told she didn't care.<br/><br/>"The trip went well until we got to Lady Faithe's childhood home," Moadayd said. "We found it in ruins and while she was looking around we where confronted by a group of Horde. It was more than clear that they did not want us there."<br/><br/>"I was afraid of this," Gentyl said.<br/><br/>He continued. "However they made no aggressive moves towards us. Until.....I have seen many unmatched odds in my day. What what stood before us was a no win fight. While I was with Lady Faithe in the ruins he attacked."<br/><br/>"Cyrus?"<br/><br/>Moadayd nodded. "He left us to pick a fight. Mind you he wasn't but ten yards away, but that was enough to divied us and allow them to break us down. I find it very odd that against seven Horde he would leave the person that he was paid to protect."<br/><br/>"He said he would to distract them so Faithe could get away if you were confronted. It appears that's what he tried to do," Gentyl said.<br/><br/>Wolfgaar 's eyes moved from face to face as he listened intently to the story unfold.<br/><br/>"There was nowhere to run. The ruins were against a small hill. We where trapped. I stood for as long as I could, and failed in my duties to protect Lady Faithe."<br/><br/>"The fault was not thine, sir."<br/><br/>"I fell knowing I did what I could and was ready to die know that I failed."<br/><br/>Gentyl reached over and took his hand. "No one failed. We'll get her back."<br/><br/>"It seemed thou didst meet an unstoppable force."<br/><br/>Moadayd looked into the flames. "I awoke in this grove with Master Coolgust standing over me. He told if it wasn't for the Ruby ring that all my brothers wear I would have been left to bleed out and die in the Mage tower. Someone got us there but they could care less if I died."<br/><br/>"Ye gods!" Wolfgaar exclaimed.<br/> <br/>"Rose got you there," Gentyl said. "She barely lives herself."<br/><br/>"My brothers want blood," Moadayd said, "however all I wish for is the chance to recover my honor!"<br/><br/>"Someone in you order has great power?" Gentyl asked.<br/>Moadayd shook his head. "No, my lady, the rings are only used for tracking. My eldest brother Moadeed knew I was to be in the Barrens, but he sensed I was in the city."<br/><br/>Gentyl nodded. "Ah, the tabard that was returned whole though it was bloodstained. Since the tenet stitchings were intact I knew she all right. It was a sign to me also."<br/><br/>Moadayd looked down to his bandages to see them bleeding thru. "Now that I have disclosed to you what I know, I must change my wrappings and rest."<br/><br/>"Thank you, sir," Wolfgaar said. "Allow me to lend what magical assistance I may be able to provide."<br/><br/>"I am sorry that I could not protect her."<br/><br/>Gentyl shushed him and changed out the wrappings while Wolfgaar laid a healing hand on his clansman. "Light comfort thee, good sir. Thine honor is intact yet."<br/><br/>"Faithe will be fine," Gentyl said with more assurance than she felt. She tossed the bloody bandages in the fire Wolfgaar was stoking. Perhaps he was better in the open, but she would have been more at ease with him in an infirmary. She looked up at Wolfgaar and started to say something, but he put a finger to his lip and motioned to Moadayd who was already asleep.

Taelanas was new with Pia, but he was everything Gentyl looked for in a recruit. In many ways, he reminded her of Prophyt, her missing squire.<br/><br/>He had remained silent while she talked to Imperon, but now she could see he was uneasy. He set his mug on the table and turned his attention to the head of the table.<br/><br/>"Have you settled in? Did you find an acceptable room? I'm sorry I didn't have time to show you around the barracks." She watched the people in the inn. Most of them were familiar to her. A few were new faces. One young woman hid in the shadows under the stairs, nibbling at a crust of bread. She was like a timid little mouse. Gentyl wondered if anyone even noticed she was there. She would set up an account so the woman would at least have food until they could find her a home.<br/><br/>Taelanas started, "Yes, ma'am. Thank you. : I'm not picky. Its warm and dry. Bed even."<br/><br/>"Yes, but as a guard, you have certain rights. A room of your own with a bed, chest, desk and garderobe among other things."<br/><br/>"That's quite luxurious, ma'am."<br/><br/>Gentyl shrugged and continued to watch the people in the inn. Too many new faces. Something was happening. She dribbled a bit of honey in her tea and stirred it. "Gods, one of my priestesses has been sleeping in the library."<br/><br/>"By the Light, why?"<br/><br/>Gentyl took a sip of the tea and pondered the questions. "Normally Amerae was abnormally intelligent. I just assumed she kept falling asleep in the library. She was overjoyed to learn she had her own room with bookshelves."<br/><br/>Taelanas seemed utterly shocked. Most people would have been. On the other hand, Gentyl is the one who let the woman sleep in the library every night.<br/><br/>"Sepha," Taelanas said slowly. "Do you really think it's a good idea to deal with Lluchduu. They are hated in the barrens.<br/><br/>She ordered another round. "I'm hoping to be able to ransom her before it comes to a battle."<br/><br/>"Have they made any demands?" <br/><br/>"Ishnu have offered to barter for her return."<br/><br/>"It's a price I can't meet, unless we can find Liko<br/><br/>

(Posted by Red Earth)<br/><br/>To Gentyl of the Pia Presidium, <br/><br/>I write to you seeking information. I met a young woman who calls herself Faithe. She claims to know you. I thought it prudent to inform you that she was found in the Barrens in the company of those whom we have come to consider enemies. They refused to leave when asked and then attacked my sister, Kickfeather. The resulting melee ended in our favor. However, Faithe, who did not raise arms against us herself, refused to leave the Barrens. And as a result it was Kickfeather’s decision to take her into custody and have me decide what to do with her.<br/><br/>She has come to no harm, minus a few sc!*!@s and bruises which have been tended to. I have decided to treat her as a guest until we have confirmed her intentions. So she will be well cared for while among the Ishnu Por Ah.<br/><br/>We had the privilege of speaking to each other briefly that to the help of a night elf and one among our number who was a little familiar with their language. Since your name came up, I assume you know of Faithe. And I seek to know if you can tell me why she would be in the Barrens with such people.<br/><br/>It is my hope you will reply post haste. Word has begun to work its way through the Horde of a captured human among the Tauren. And I worry for her safety. At the same time, I am not as of yet willing to just release her. If I do not hear from you in a few days’ time, I will have to reconsider the situation and it may not be in the most favorable way for any of us.<br/><br/>Earthmother guide you<br/>Red Earth of the Blackhide

(Posted by Cyrus)<br/><br/>"Cyrus, you can't keep dodging me. What happened? Actually, scratch that. Just skip ahead to the part where you decided to make things hostile over there," Narnicka said rather calmly, eyeing his brother carefully for any signs of deception. Clearly, there was some tension, as Narnicka had always disagreed with any violence in the Barrens or Durotar. Something about those lands made him cringe at the thought of war. <br/><br/>"They were getting closer, Narn. My job was to protect her, and they needed to understand that any advancing upon her would be met with violence. Apparently sending a little blast of cold toward that shaman wasn't enough of a sign. I was actually hoping Faithe would escape while the majorty of that patrolling force was focussed on Moad, Rose and myself," Cyrus said in his usual tone of disinterest. Explaining himself to everyone who had approached him was growing old. <br/><br/>"So, what's your next move?"<br/><br/>"Get the last bits of my armor repaired and finish the job. My job was to see to the safety of that priestess. I haven't seen any reason to believe she won't be harmed in their custody. This time, I'll have the Ocheliad on my side. They're going to regret taking a hostage. What a cowardly..." Cyrus doesn't finish the sentence, settling for spitting to the ground at his right. "Doesn't matter. This time we'll be on even ground."<br/><br/>Narnicka seemed a bit disturbed by this, folding his arms. "But didn't Gentyl say your job was done? I distinctly remember overhearing that in her last conversation with your girl."<br/><br/>"I'd obviously prefer this to be sanctioned by Gentyl, but she can blow it out her back end if she thinks I'm just gonna let this go." Cyrus runs his thumb along his left eye, which is stitched shut. "An eye for an eye makes the whole blind, they say. Well, it's my turn to put out someone's eye. Gentyl's method seems to be one of negotiation, or at least that's what I'd expect from her. The Ocheliad way is punishment. So, as soon as Imperon gives me the green light, I'm leading forces back out there. Only to punish them."<br/>

It seemed word had traveled quickly about the fight and the capture of her Guard. Offers to help came flooding in from people she didn't even know.<br/><br/>Three people had sold her information that Faithe had been captured. After she paid the last one for information and had gotten, "One of your Guards has been captured. Don't know what her name is or who nabbed her," she started politely declining offers of information from people she didn't know.<br/><br/>She was exhausted, but spent the rest of the afternoon in the Blue Recluse waiting for someone from AAMS to show up and take the letter to Red Earth. The sooner they could meet, the better. She trusted Red Earth, but not the rest of the Horde. If word got out, Red Earth might not have any choice in the matter and be forced to give the girl up.<br/><br/>Negotiations might have gone a lot better if she hadn't sipped those bunny ears on Red Earth while she was fishing. She seemed none to happy about that.<br/><br/>A courier walked in at last. "Rosanth, I need this letter to go to Red Earth as soon as possible."<br/><br/>Gentyl looked at it one last time.<br/><br/>"Sister Red Earth,<br/><br/>It's come to my attention..."<br/><br/>It wasn't pretty, but she had to hope it would convey her desire to meet as soon as possible without seeming too desperate.

(Posted by Crayauchtin)<br/><br/>Cray shifted in his seat. Though he was trying hard to remain calm, he was enraged. Enraged at what the Horde had done, enraged that he had not been there to help, enraged at the severe injuries that had been inflicted on Faithe's bodyguards, enraged that he was in the barracks and not in the Barrens hunting down the monsters that had taken Faithe. He was enraged that he was helpless.<br/><br/>At least she was alive, but Cray did not trust the Tauren -- nor, indeed, any who would ally themselves with Orcs.<br/><br/>It felt like it was time for vengeance. It was his training as a warrior -- his entire lifetime -- overriding his training as a Paladin -- the last eight years. It was understandable, he'd been assured many times, but he would need to control it. He was not, after all, an agent of vengeance or a minion of anger. He was a champion of the Light and an Incorruptible.<br/><br/>Aside from that, it hadn't been that long ago that he'd been struck by lightning from that Worgen.... he should probably be resting more than he was as it was.<br/><br/>That didn't change how full of rage he was. He inhaled deeply, trying to calm himself. Cyrus, Rose and Moad were in no condition to return to battle -- even if they had been recovering. He was going to have to calm down completely before Sepha Gentyl would even consider allowing him to journey to the Barrens with her.<br/><br/>((OOC: I'm sure Gentyl isn't going to give Cray any sort of go-ahead to go into the Barrens (she's a bright lady :P), but if by some strange chance she does.... this can be your IC payback for my OOCly sticking bunny ears on you, Redearth. And so we're clear, it was OOCly because of the epic death that immediately followed it.... :P))<br/>

<br/>(Posted by Rosanth)<br/><br/>Rosanth hurried across the park on her way to see Gentyl. The message she was to deliver was urgent and she hoped her contact in the Horde branch of AAMS would not have a problem delivering it.<br/><br/>Tucking the letter into her satchel, Rosie dashed off to the guild headquarters to contact her friend Tohatsu. After assuring Rosanth she would be happy to meet with Sister Redearth, Tohatsu suggested the carrier owls so common among the druids to deliver the note.<br/><br/>After checking the letter to make sure it was secure in its leather case, Rosanth attached the small leather tube to the owl and advised it in no uncertain terms to fly directly to Tohatsu, who was waiting in the Barrens.<br/><br/>With a whoosh of grey wings the great owl flew off into the night. The chances of being intercepted were slim as the owl moved with silent flight and could see a predador from a mile away. As it neared the Barrens the owl circled for a few moments to insure safety and then landed next to the waiting troll priest.<br/><br/>Tohatsu nearly jumped out of her skin as the mighty owl landed next to her. "Whoa! You be so silent there I not hear you!!" with her hearth thumping. The owl blinked and hooted as if laughing at the priest. Tohatsu giggled and retrieved the letter, tucking it safely into her pouch. <br/><br/>With a steady trot, the troll priest managed to reach the mesas of Thunderbluff before dawn. Though it was several hours before she could find anyone of Ishnu Por Ah to pass the message. She cautiously used the hearthstone common as public messages and called for a representative of the mighty tauren tribe. <br/><br/>The brave approached her on the middle rise and offered to take the note to Redearth. Tohatsu hesitated, she had been told to deliver this to Sister Redearth and time was wasting. She nodded to the brave and consulted with her superior Yotingo, who confirmed the brave Arapache could deliver the note safely.<br/><br/>"My orders were to deliva dis to Sista Redearth. I am saddened I could not meet with her. Howeva, Yotingo vouches for ya, so I will give ya da letta. Please convey my greetin's ta Sista Redearth and allow me da honor of a return message if dere be one comin' "<br/><br/>Arapache assures Tohatsu the note will be delivered as soon as possible and flies off soon after.<br/>

(Posted by Arapache)<br/><br/>Arapache moved quickly through the lodge of Ishnu Por Ah, walking straight for where Redearth usually would take rest when staying there. He quickly left a letter with alliance and horde AAMS seals on it. If examined it would read thus:<br/><br/>Sister Redearth,<br/><br/>I understand there has been some misunderstanding about why Faithe was in the Barrens with an armed guard. She is one of my guards, but I have recently assigned her to Magnus Ignota as an ambassador.<br/><br/>She wished to visit her adopted Orc parents who are quite elderly, and take them some supplies. Since she was attacked and beaten last time she went I wanted her protected. <br/><br/>I would like to discuss her release.<br/><br/>Truly,<br/>Gentyl<br/><br/><br/><br/>Append is a rough parchment.<br/><br/>This is nothing the girl did not already tell us, and if she was attacked and beaten for being in the Barrens last time, why would she return with an armed guard? To draw more attention and get beaten by a larger force, angry about alliance invaders? This story seems to have little credibility, and no corroboration that I can find.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Arapache steped out of the lodge and went to a nearby fruit vendor and purchased some of the fresh pick. He walked away, a few apples heavier, down the great totem of thunder bluff to the low rise. He stopes and also picked up some newly baked flatbread. After satisfied with the food, he took to the skies and turned to the place where the people of the ravens feather kept their new prisoner. He landed and pulled out a copy of the letter he had just delivered, this one without the notes. He walked to Faithe's new residence and knocked. He didn't hear an answer so he left the letter with the food in a basket outside the door, and nodded solomly at the guards. He tossed them each an apple and said something about keeping alert, sharp eyes, the kind of useless advice people give to guards who are expecting attack.<br/>

(Posted by Faithe)<br/><br/>Her hair was over her face when she awoke. It's smelled of smoke and leather and that earthy scent of the woolen blankets she'd been sleeping on. Faithe pushed herself up and pulled the buckskin bag she'd used for a pillow into her lap. At the bottom was the throw she had embroidered for Papa. She'd spent months on it, painstakingly creating a large map of all the places he had been and told her about. He wouldn't know, but many times she had snipped the thread out and started over if something wasn't just right. <br/><br/>Mama would have loved it if she could see it, but Faithe knew she would run her fingers over the work and feel the threads. She'd smile when she felt the bumps and ridges in the cloth where Faithe had layered the stitches until it was almost like a sculptured fabric. At the edges, Faithe had painstakingly knotted green fringe to represent the tall grass she and Papa had hid in to watch the centaurs.<br/><br/>She laid the cloth aside and opened a packet of dried fish for Snow. The kitten wasn't in the tent. "Snow? Come kitty."<br/><br/>The kitten trotted in dragging a gopher almost as big as she was.<br/><br/>A guard just outside the door laughed. "Little Hunter--" She couldn't understand the rest and started puzzling out the words. Feed Mama. Little Hunter feed Mama.<br/><br/>Snow laid the gopher down at her feet and looked up at her as if saying, "I brought you breakfast!"<br/><br/>Faithe smiled and stroked the kitten. "Oh, no, it's all yours, "darling." She carefully repacked the fish. Papa would have admonished her to eat lightly until they made a kill. "A hungry belly makes a good hunter," he said. It was more from habit, she knew. Mama had told her of the times they had followed the trails with little game and were forced to carefully ration their food until a kill.<br/><br/>She smiled remembering the genial bickering about how many times Midnight the nanny goat had nearly become dinner, but Mama refused to let Papa kill her because they needed the milk for Faithe. Midnight was long gone, but Mama and Papa still kept some goats from the old nanny. Papa said it was because Mama's cheese was the only kind he liked, but part of it was also them clinging to a bit of the past when they had a tiny human daughter who loved playing with the kids.<br/><br/>She wiped at her eyes. Where were they? <br/><br/>Shredded orange and purple clouds lay low on the hills like a tattered blanket. A hem of gold promising dawn outlined the ridges. She stood and walked to the door of the tent. The residual magic still tugged at her, slowing her movements and finally bringing her to a stop as she reached the opening. She needed to pee. <br/><br/>The unfamiliar guards at the tent door told her to stop and motioned her back.<br/><br/>She searched for the right words and then finally pointed down and said what she hoped was "make water."<br/><br/>They shook their heads and one pointed inside the tent. She had already noticed the chamber pot, but didn't want to use it. One of them dropped the flap on the door for a bit more privacy.<br/><br/>The sun was fully up when she heard heavy hoof beats outside. Someone tapped at the flap and she scrambled to finish. There was a conversation between the bull from the night before and the guards. Snatches of speech outside. Warnings and threats. Exhortations to be...something.<br/><br/>Then he was gone. <br/> <br/>She pushed at the flap and a guard pulled it back. He nodded to her and extended a package. She opened it up and smiled. Fresh fruit and goat cheese. <br/><br/>"Thank you."<br/><br/>He nodded and turned away. She wanted to ask him when she would be released, but the words eluded her and he probably didn't know anyway.<br/><br/>Hunting with Papa had taught her patience. It was easier to be patient when you weren't the one in the trap.

(Posted by Vanressa)<br/><br/>Vanressa perched on the outside gable of the mage tower in Stormwind with her eyes fixed on a storm brewing over the Great Sea offshore. Many allies of her association who had once even called themselves friend to her predecessor, Ehlina Vargas, had known the day would come when the ceasefire following Vargas' death would be shattered. Many who were friends or otherwise were clamoring for war and would not let the Horde's champions shame them for much longer. Her gaze turned glassy blank as she rubbed her fingers together and stirred around little plumes of arcane energy that occasionally emanated from the tower. Her thoughts seemed to come together then, as she found herself a bit more relaxed than she had been in weeks.<br/><br/>Surely Red Earth would be willing to release the girl back to us. Pillar and my associates have done nothing to incite violence and have stayed out of any armed action in the Barrens since our meeting. Maybe she would be willing to take me as a more neutral spokesperson for our people... Then again I expect talking might never come close to happening, what with how some people want naught but blood to be the outcome of this situation. Huh. I could always send Brenri now that she is somewhat lucid again. She may have a temper and something of a grudge against Red Earth, but most of the time she hits who needs hitting... if it comes down to that. I should consult with my... allies.<br/><br/>Summoning a stylus and piece of paper from thin air, she began to write to Gentyl a letter expressing her intentions to be of assistance in this matter.

Gentyl was standing in front of the bank reading letters when the courier approached. "Miss Gentyl, Aeldgyth," said. "Just the person I was looking for."<br/><br/>Gentyl folded the letter in her hand and put it in her bag. Somewhere nearby a bush whispered. "I can see you, can you see me?" Stormwind was getting odder by the day, or maybe she was just descending a bit further into madness. Either way, she eased away from the nearby bushes and closer to the fountain where a nearly Draenei man was splashing about doing some odd dance and clapping while he sang an unfamiliar tune.<br/><br/>"Gods. Aeldgyth, can you meet me at the Recluse?"<br/><br/>The gnome nodded and Gentyl untied Traveler who had managed to accidentally nudge a little girl and spill her ice cream. He refused to lift his head until he had licked the last of it up, completely impervious to the wails of the distraught child. The mother dragged the little girl away with promises of another ice cream.<br/><br/>"Traveler, make up your mind. Ice cream or cherry grog. I can't afford both and you're going to have to stop bumping people with ice cream."<br/><br/>A guard walked by and gave her the same look she had given the talking bush a moment ago.<br/><br/>Aeldgyth was waiting patiently for her when she arrived. Thankfully, for once, it was nearly deserted. <br/><br/>"You wished to see me?" Gentyl said and then immediately added. "I'm sorry, Miss Aeldgyth. I hope you are well. Any word from Vasillia, yet?"<br/><br/>The gnome shook her perfectly coifed head. She was always so pristine. How did anyone keep their robes so sparking white in this town? <br/><br/>"Yes, to the first. I'm fine. No. Vasillia is still missing. And, speaking of missing. Miss Red Earth sent a message."<br/><br/>Gentyl took the note and slid a tip over to Aeldgyth absently. She folded the note and added it to her collection in the bag. "Yes, tell her I want to meet with her as soon as possible.<br/>

A campfire flickered outside the tent. Faithe heard the guards laughing and joking. On the other side of the fire, four of them played dice on a blanket. She had watched them unfurl it and then sit down on it. The firelight highlighted their features in gold and flashed off an occasional gem when one raised his hand. <br/><br/>"Argh," one shouted as he reached over and punched the male next to him. The one who was punched snorted an raked the pile of coins into this pile.<br/><br/>It was that same scene that played out in almost any military camp on any night. She had been in the field enough to realize boredom was often the greatest enemy.<br/><br/>Some commanders allowed a ration of liquor to ease the pain of separation from loved ones and civilization, while others forbade it to be used for anything other than drugging an injured man for treatment. Some encouraged games to break up the monotony. Gambling was strictly forbidden in many camps because it invariably led to fights over money. This commander seemed to be on the more lax side. <br/><br/>She wasn't surprised. This unit was in a remote outpost where little happened. The guards spent their days watching for the occasional encroachment on their territory. Patrols went out each day and mostly came back empty handed. They had returned with two heads earlier. <br/><br/>Looters.<br/><br/>Faithe should have felt sympathy for the men, but she didn't. She had seen the razed camps and bodies of the Taurens still lying on the ground. They hadn't even had enough decency to bury them before they looted the camp. She had been tempted to take one pot a looter offered her simply because she recognized the love that had gone into making it. Another time she might have taken it and left it at a burial site, but they had planned to be in and out quickly. <br/><br/>Now, she thanked the Light she hadn't bought the pot. She had no doubt no one would believe she wasn't a looter also.<br/><br/>Snow curled up in her lap, purring as she gently stroked the kitten.<br/><br/>The kitten raised her head and growled at the back of the tent. Faithe turned to look, but someone was already inside. She couldn't see them, but there was a disturbance in the air. A rogue or druid stealthed.<br/><br/>Before she could make a noise, a hand clapped over her mouth. "Shh, Lady Faithe."<br/><br/>She struggled against the grip and then recognized the old language of Lord Wolfgaar. "Maiden fair, fear not."<br/><br/>Sara materialized in front of her.<br/>Faithe relaxed. "You're heard to get me out?"<br/><br/>Wolfgaar tugged at the rope binding her ankle to the post. "What fel magic is this? I cannot release it. Lady Sara, can you help?"<br/><br/>The druidess whispered a cant over Faithe, but the bonds remained.<br/><br/>"They have a mage who keeps the binding on me," Faithe whispered.<br/><br/>"Gah," Wolfgaar huffed. "We cannot free you. I had penned a note of encouragement before Lady Sara offered her assistance. I hoped to send it to the Ishnu to give it to you. Keep it until we return. We'll be back on the morrow with help. Be of good cheer. We will return you home."<br/><br/>He raised her hand to his lips and kissed it, then slipped the note to her.<br/><br/>"We have to go," Sara whispered. "The guard will patrol past soon."<br/><br/>They slipped out the back of the tent and were gone. <br/><br/>She unfolded the note and held it close to her face so she could read it.<br/><br/>Take heart and do not despair! Your friends have not ceased searching for you since the moment you were taken. These Horde knaves will regret what they have done to you. I swear by all that is holy that we will rescue you. Stay strong and of good courage! I will return.<br/> -=W=-<br/><br/><br/> <br/>

Gentyl hired several people to go around alliance and horde towns posting the notice. The chances of someone finding Liko after six months were slim, but the Ishnu had mentioned his return as a possible price for Faithe's release.<br/><br/>"Wanted: Information about the whereabouts of the Taruen bull Liko of the Ishnu Por Ah. Fifty gold will be paid by Gentyl D'Amond for legitimate information."<br/><br/>((Read this thread. Figure out what's already been done. Search somewhere and post here and on the Mising: Liko Farstrider thread and I will pay 50 gold either in person, via a Pia Presdium member or if it's a horde post through AAMS. It has to be a legitimate search and post, not just "I looked everywhere in the Barrens and couldn't find him.))<br/>

More and more converged upon the single set, much to her dismay. With work, she followed the initial set. Eventually, they crested over a short hill. Upon the other side was an Alliance encampment. The haggard soldiers eyed her as she crossed the hill with a sense of alarm. After looking at her silhouette for a moment, they lost interest. "Just a gnome!". She hurried to the camp as fast as her legs would take her.<br/><br/>"What happened here?" she asked.<br/><br/>"Tauren. Had ta be fifty of 'em. They ransacked the place a few nights ago. We've been on a double shift since 'en." replied an older soldier.<br/><br/>"Which direction did they go? I'm looking for a Tauren, myself!"<br/><br/>"Kid, if yer' lookin' fer Tauren, this is the place to be." replied another guard, gravely.<br/>

(Posted by Dernes)<br/><br/>"I thank you all for you assistance. We will keep searching for Liko, and any other survivors. Please, call on us if you need anything, or remember something else."<br/><br/>With heavy thoughts Dernes left the camp and returned to Taurajo as quickly as he could, sharing what little he had learned with Teicuih. Running low on ideas, they decided to stop for the day and plan a new approach come morning.<br/><br/>Once back in the halls, Dernes spread out a large map of Azeroth on a table and pointed. "Ok so he started here, and was in Taurajo during the attacks. He might have been captured by humans, or gone after them... but then the earth shattered just a few days later. He can travel rather fast so he could have made it pretty far." He stared at the map for a very long time, and tapped his finger over Camp Forward, "The attack either came from here, or Fort Triumph. But for that size, I would have guessed he went there..."<br/><br/>"You just goings to go ask them?"<br/><br/>"No chances of that working... They'll kill me before I get in sight of their camp." He sighed sadly, shaking his head, "No. We will sleep on it. It's been a long day, and we need a clear mind."<br/><br/>Before going to sleep, he wrote up next to each place they had visited any facts learned. "Tomorrow we go visit Alliance towns. As peacefully as any of it can be done these days." <br/><br/>The last thing he remembered to do was to leave a note for Margie, to see what she could have possibly learned.<br/><br/> Margie,<br/><br/>We are going to look for Liko again tomorrow. I left everything we found out on the map and now we need to question the Alliance. Let us know if you find out anything else! Or want to translate. I'll try not to start trouble.<br/><br/>Dernes
