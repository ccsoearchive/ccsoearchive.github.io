"Do you need a receipt sir?" <br/><br/>Aleshton shook his head at the the teller. Next to him was a gnome, and in his pocket was a warrant for a gnome named Timeus, and Timeus was this gnome. At least he thought so. Aleshton lingered in the bank on some pretense or other, watching the gnome. The T-type gnome left the bank and checked his mail, and Aleshton followed him out into the chilled Dalaran night.<br/><br/>Soon though Aleshton ran out of pretense and wandered off, when he turned the gnome was gone. He sighed a breath of relief, the issue had not come to a point and he was able to let the issue go without haveing to potentially arrest Timeus. <br/><br/>"Lots o' gnome mages roun' 'ere any'ow..."<br/><br/>Aleshton teleported back to Stormwind and bedded down for the night, his conscience yet clear.

Derscha stepped onto the pier at Ratchet with familiarity; the goblins gave her the usual foul looked reserved for the delightful combination that was a gnome <em>and</em> and an AAMS courier, but otherwise paid her no mind. AAMS couriers were a frequent enough sight.<br/><br/>The gnome, however, kept a watchful eye on those around her, looking for her guide. She tipped her hat and greeted passerbys, Horde and Alliance alike. At last, as she was near the edge of the docks, she heard Harmarth's voice whispering from a shadow. <br/><br/><em>"Don't worry. I'm gonna to stay hidden 'til we're out of town. Then I'll show myself."</em><br/><br/>Derscha nodded in understanding.<br/><br/><em>"We're looking for a woman. She'll be out of town."</em><br/><br/>This certainly counted as one of her more peculiar deliveries; she didn't know whom she was looking for, and was being guided by a rogue she only occasionally caught a glimpse of, when he let her know he was still there. It was peculiar, indeed, but her curiosity meant that she was determined to see it to the end.<br/><br/>She'd finally tracked down Timeus, and delivered Katamar's message. The mage took the advice rather calmly and offered her some tea. He asked if she'd be willing to accept a commission to deliver a couple of packages for him, two small boxes.<br/><br/>The first was to Jon Harmarth. However, Tim refrained from identifying the second recipient, instead telling her that Harmarth would know whom to deliver it to. . . all Derscha knew was which town. Harmarth's package had contained an odd ring, and a letter. After reading the letter, he said he knew whom to meet. <br/><br/>So now they were heading to the outskirts of Ratchet, Derscha carrying the second package, while Harmarth took a more circumspect route (it seemed he wasn't very popular with the locals.) There was a woman waiting, as expected. Someone Derscha recognized.<br/><br/>"Jonathon," Suni greeted them with a weak smile.<br/><br/>"Brought a package."<br/><br/>"The supplies?"<br/><br/>"Whatever it was he sent. He didn't get into specifics."<br/><br/>Suni looked at him with a sideways glance, forestalling any more conversation. "Aye. Tell me, Jon, it's hot. Do the titans like the rain?"<br/><br/>"I don't know, but at least I've got a towel."<br/><br/>She chuffed at him, while Derscha rolled her eyes and giggled at the the apparent exchange of codes. No one thought to check that <em>Derscha</em> was whom she appeared to be, of course. Lucky that she was the bona fide original. <br/><br/>"What are you doing here?" Suni asked. "You… both of you... This is dangerous."<br/><br/>"Tim sent me."<br/><br/>"Why?"<br/><br/>"To help help keep an eye on you, that's why. We're all in over our heads here until we find out exactly what's going on. And with the Watch being anything but helpful, we've got to do things our way." Harmarth sounded frustrated at the situation. "Believe me, if I was worried about getting in trouble, or getting hurt, I'd have never stuck my nose in this to begin with. Nor would I be tangling with Modas every other week."<br/><br/>Suni took a shallow breath, nodding. "I was hoping there'd be better news."<br/><br/>"All I know for sure is that the Watch is still convinced you two are the prime suspects right now."<br/><br/>"As for me," Derscha spoke up, "I'm just a messenger, yes?"<br/><br/>Suni gave her an understanding look. "Best we not keep you tangled in this mess."<br/><br/>"If you'd just accept delivery…" she offered the box to Suni, who took it carefully. <br/><br/>"Thank you, both."<br/><br/>Derscha touched the brim of her hat in the imitation of a salute. "You're most welcome." She giggled as the next phrase automatically came to mind. "Thanks for using the AAMS. I'll just be on my way, but do let me know if I can be of help again."<br/><br/>"You should probably escort her back," Suni told Harmarth.<br/><br/>"Escort?" Derscha asked archly. "The AAMS frequently visits Ratchet."<br/><br/>"Of course, Miss Kettlebomb, I meant no offense." She gave Harmarth a tired look. "I need to go, soon. I can't stay in one place too long."<br/><br/>"I'm going with you," he replied in a deadly serious tone. Derscha paused, wondering if Suni would convince him to escort her to Ratchet anyway, just to get him to leave.<br/><br/>She shook her head emphatically. "You cannot. Please… trust me."<br/><br/>"It's ok, Suni." An unfamiliar human male suddenly stepped forward from the shadows. "We could use his help. I'm not entirely sure what we're up against."<br/><br/>"Timeus asked me to help," Harmarth pressed his case, "and I'm not going to step back on this. I want to figure this out just as much as you do."<br/><br/>Suni looked between them, then glanced down at the gnome with a pleading look. "At least one of us can be wise enough not to get caught up in this mess?"<br/><br/>Derscha nodded in agreement and said quick farewells; it <em>would</em> be foolish to get involved any further without knowing the details, and she had a company to run. Suni would know how to reach her if she felt the AAMS could be of assistance. <br/><br/><em>((There you go, Suni!))</em>

Tim finally got a response to the message he had sent through the Kirin Tor to Fernand Argustus, informing him that the Forsaken magus was in Dalaran and had agreed to meet. Per the agreement made prior, he met up with Gelyne Mathews and Kordrion before they all went to Dalaran. As soon as they arrived, Kordrion took to the shadows in case things went poorly. They followed the directions to the Violet Citadel and, from there, up to the Purple Parlor.<br/><br/>The Parlor had often served as a private retreat for the higher ranked mages within the Kirin Tor for centuries but with the move to Northrend, the restriction had loosened somewhat. Regardless, it was a bit out of the way for most visitors, so it didn't often have non-mage patrons. The dress code also tended to discourage folks.<br/><br/>Tim led the way into the Parlor and after speaking with the butler, Alfred Copperworth, led the way to the balcony where their meeting would take place. Kordrion kept out of sight while Gelyne, dressed up for a night out, followed behind the gnome.<br/><br/>They found the balcony clear of any save for themselves and Argustus and another person speaking with him. Tim hadn't expected to see the master assassin of the Modas Il Toralar to be here for the meeting but considering he had brought support of his own, he couldn't really blame Argustus. By the barely audible intake of breath from behind him, he guessed that Kordrion hadn't expected it as well. Either way, it was bound to be a tense meeting. Argustus and Vectus turned to him and the following words confirmed it.<br/><br/>"I assume you've come to demand ransom. Be quick about it, as I am sorely tempted to burn you to the ground."<br/><br/>Tim cleared his throat and was about to speak when Gelyne beat him to the punch. "Now darling, that's no way to start a meeting. We've come on friendly terms." She reached into the top of her thigh-high boots and a throwing dagger found itself in Vectus' hand. She tsked and slowly pulled out a lollipop, a lopsided smirk on her face as she casually popped it into her mouth. Tim gritted his teeth briefly. Really, he would have to talk to her about that later. He turned his attention back to the Forsaken.<br/><br/>"I've no interest in ransom. What I want to know is what intentions you have for Lilienne."<br/><br/>The statement seemed to surprise Argustus, replaced quickly by a mask of cold fury. "My intentions? For her to live a safe, long, and happy life. Which you may very well have ruined by kidnapping her."<br/><br/>"Actually, my friend, I don't believe he did. At least, not originally."<br/><br/>Argustus' expression spoke of several emotions in rapid succession: betrayal, disbelief, confusion. It was the last that he settled on, looking between the gnome and his friend. Tim watched Vectus now, frowning. If the assassin noticed, he made no sign.<br/><br/>"I believe that others are responsible for the attempt on your daughter. In truth, he is responsible for keeping her safe." Now it was Tim's turn to look confused and a little worried, but kept silent. Argustus was nothing of the sort.<br/><br/>"How do you know? Lilienne could be in danger or hurt."<br/><br/>Vectus took his friend's arm firmly. "I've seen her. She is as safe as is possible for the time being. I've seen to that."<br/><br/>Timeus felt a chill wash through him. "What have you done to Suni?" He could feel the power within him start to rise to his unconcious call, the air around him starting to grow warmer. Vectus looked to him now, only his eyes visible behind his mask. "I have left Miss Dahlamar unharmed, as well as Mister Harmarth. At least this time, they have nothing to fear from me." Seeing that it didn't really settle the gnome's fears, Vectus looked between the two mages. "I think perhaps we should take a moment. We all seem to be here for the child's welfare. Let us start over from the beginning and discuss the situation." He drew nods from both mages, though neither would be set at ease so quickly. Too much bad blood had built over the years for that.<br/><br/>They all adjourned from the balcony and made their way to a private section of the Parlor, closed off by floating curtains. While Gelyne was dubious about the privacy of such a thin barrier, both mages knew better: the Parlor was known to be a discreet establishment, often given to lively discourse among it's patrons. Having the curtains enchanted to prevent eavesdropping was far less obtrusive than thick walls and heavy doors and far more fitting of the city's aesthetic.

Timeus was the last to enter. He waved off the butler's attempt to offer them drinks, much to Gelyne's disappointment. It also gave Kordrion the opportunity to slip inside. Once the curtain was drawn and everyone seated, they began to speak more openly about what had occured. Tim explained what happened from his end, Gelyne gave an accounting of what she knew of the investigation, and Vectus told of how he had been tracking the kidnappers as they unerringly managed to track Lilienne and her guardians. During their stories, the unthinkable seemed to occur: attitudes seemed to relax and a sort of trust that, at least for the time being, they were all working togeather for a greater purpose than their previous emnity had allowed. As Argustus put it, they could go back to killing each other once she was truely safe.<br/><br/>Once each had recounted their experiences thus far, both Argustus and Vectus seemed to think a number of people had acted strangely, such as a member of the Watch burning potential evidence. And then there was the actions of a certain military commander that bothered both Forsaken in light of what they learned from Tim and Gelyne's respective accounts.<br/><br/>"Is it possible that Narnicka was involved somehow?", mused Vectus. "He made the deal to protect Lilienne at a cost, then she promptly goes missing. Then he collects evidence and presents it to the Watch."<br/><br/>Gelyne played with the long-finished lollipop stick, pointing it at Vectus. "He was awfully quick to accuse Timeus when I mentioned it was a gnomish design."<br/>Vectus nodded thoughtfully, rubbing his chin through his mask. "Yes, so you said. His deal gives him a perfect excuse to include himself in the investigation, which already focuses on the gnome. When Lilienne can't be found and Miss Mathews resigns, he dissolves his command and takes flight for the Undercity. He is retrieved by his own son's command, is that correct?" Gelyne nodded her confirmation. The assassin shook his head. "Very strange. And suspicious. I wonder...could he have some connection to this Ultio Brotherhood?"<br/><br/>Argustus' frustration got the better of him in an uncharacteristic show of emotion. "We should just kill the ones in the Watch and Stonehardt and be done with it."<br/><br/>Both Timeus and Vectus chimed in at nearly the same time.<br/><br/>"Yes, leave a trail of bodies. That would be a brilliant idea."<br/><br/>"My friend, as unusual as it is for me to say this, I think you are letting your emotions cloud your judgement. As the gno...Timeus...sarcastically suggested, it would only make matters worse. We need to learn more about our enemy and those that MIGHT be aiding them." Argustus sighed in frustration and agreed to abide by his friend's judgement.<br/><br/>In the end, they parted with a rough plan of attack at this still largely unknown enemy. Before they parted, Tim stopped Argustus.<br/><br/>"You should know, I think you would be proud of your daughter. Despite everything she's been through in her life and in recent weeks, she has proven to be a brilliant, observant, and kind hearted child."<br/><br/>Argustus was taken aback at the statement and after a moment to compose himself, thanked Tim for his words. Gelyne even had a genuine smile. When Argustus and Vectus were alone in the small pavilion, Argustus turned to his friend.<br/><br/>"Amazing how thing's work out, isn't it? I suppose we were fortunate we didn't kill that one in the attack on the Pillar, hmm?"<br/><br/>Vectus grew thoughtful. He had much to think of.<br/><br/>"Quite fortunate indeed."

((From the summary of Orwyn's official report of events))<br/><br/>The arrest warrant for Mr. Timeus was served at approximately 7:30pm on the 30th. Our plan of action was executed perfectly, in no small part due to thorough preparation and precise and vigorous action by the arresting officers.<br/><br/>Upon arrival at Ironforge's Hall of Explorers, the arresting party composed of myself, Lieutenant Skyriver, and Officers Fairweather, Godwin, and Dustwalker gathered outside the front door of Mr. Timeus' home and workshop. Officer Fairweather removed a protection enchantment on the door. At that point, I loudly announced our presence and intentions. Officer Godwin removed the door so that entry could be quickly gained to the building. Leaving the Lieutenant outside to ensure Mr. Timeus did not try to escape via any of the front windows, the rest of the party rushed in to search the premises Mr. Timeus was located on the second floor of the building. He was temporarily stunned via holy magic, and handcuffed by Officer Godwin. Once recovered, he refused to answer any questions on scene and was transported to the Stockade in Stormwind, whereupon he was placed in the care of the Warden.<br/><br/>Due to the circumstances posed by potential danger to the kidnapping victim and Mr. Timeus' high risk of flight, I made the decision to act with more haste and force than is usual in such circumstances. I believe it was justified, and it met with success. Although Mr. Timeus has refused to answer questions, I believe that new leads on his potential co-conspirators will prove good, and that further arrests and time spent in the Stockade will act to bring about a change in his perception of the ultimate success of his plan. I am, of course, very well aware that time is of the essence in regards to the odds of a successful rescue of the victim, and the entire office is currently prosecuting the case with energy and every resource available.<br/><br/>Details of the case to-date follow.<br/><br/>Respectfully submitted,<br/><br/>- Lieutenant Commander Orwyn<br/> Commander, Stormwind Watch

"Sssend the lettersss, yessss! We mussssn't make the massster angry!" Weishaupt shrieked at the Undermarket couriers. An assortment of agents, with bounty notices in hand, scattered like a swarm of ants from their hill.<br/><br/>The meticulously dressed ghoul shambled back into the sanctum; grasping and clawing at the walls in order to get to his destination as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>"Massster...." the creature fell on bended knees and bowed his demented face low; his rotten and blackened mouth agape in what appeared to be a smile.<br/><br/>"Ever loyal; there are so few to trust these days, my senechal" whispered Aziel.<br/><br/>"He <em><strong>will</strong></em> bow his head. He will learn that while he has freedom of choice, he does not have freedom of consequence. Send word to my Claviger, as we have much to speak of..."<br/><br/>The sorcerers lips curl into a sardonic grin.

Vectus breathed a short sigh of relief as he neared Feathermoon and spied Suni in the distance. Here was about as out-of-the-way as was possible, but still he wasn't sure it was safe. Even with Jonathan Harmarth there to assist Suni in protecting Lilienne, he had his doubts. It had been a long week, and he still couldn't believe any of it. Here he was, aiding and relying upon allies who were once enemies, and subverting and hiding from enemies who were once allies.<br/><br/>And he knew next to nothing about this group--the Ultio Brotherhood--that had been pursuing Lilienne. The man he interrogated in the forest gave him only a prepared statement warning him of the impending demise of the Dark Lady, Modas, the RAS, and a laundry list of other people and organizations before ending his own life with a suicide capsule. The only certainty was their determination to find this child and use her as leverage against Fernand Argustus, thus furthering their goals.<br/><br/>As he neared, he lept gracefully from the gryphon that had carried him here and onto the balcony of the impromptu safe house. There Suni sat, perched on a protruding branch, overlooking the glimmering western ocean long after the sun had set here at the edge of the world.<br/><br/>Suni turned to him and smiled in greeting. "I see you've made it back."<br/><br/>Vectus gave a brief nod in acknowledgement. "How is Lilienne?"<br/><br/>"Well. She's asleep inside." Suni gestured to the closed doors behind them. "With Jonathan."<br/><br/>Wasting no time on idle chatter, Vectus began to apprise her of the current situation. "I've met with Fernand... and Timeus as well. We've decided on a tentative plan of action--"<br/><br/>"Timeus?" Suni asked, giving him a confused look. "How is he?"<br/><br/>"In custody of the Watch. I observed his arrest and initial questioning before returning here."<br/><br/>"Arrest?" Her confusion quickly turned to worry.<br/><br/>"Yes. He went willingly. He's certain he won't be held long, seeing as all of their evidence against him is circumstantial. Still, it is part of the plan from our meeting with Fernand."<br/><br/>Suni took this opportunity to slip back under the railing and onto the balcony. She clasped her hands in front of her and began rocking on her heels. Before he could go on, she interjected again. "Mr. Argustus. Did he get my letter? And the runestones?"<br/><br/>Vectus sighed in annoyance and raised a hand to caution the girl. "Calm yourself. One thing at a time. We have much to discuss, and plenty of time to do so."<br/><br/>Suni's cheeks flushed as she bit her lip and furrowed her brows. "Of course, sir. My apologies. Please, continue."<br/><br/>"But yes. I delivered them to him personally."<br/><br/>Suni smiled at this, and returned her gaze back to the ocean.<br/><br/>Waiting to see if she had anything else to say, he continued. "As far as Timeus is concerned, we believe there may be an agent from the Ultio Brotherhood within the Watch. He hopes they will reveal themselves in questioning, thus giving us more information to work with."<br/><br/>"Ultio Brotherhood? Who are they? Is that the group that's after us?"<br/><br/>"One of them, yes." Vectus paused. "Forgive me, did I not speak to you of them before?<br/><br/>"You may have," Suni replied, "But so much has happened lately, it might have slipped my mind."<br/><br/>"Indeed. Far too much."<br/><br/>"So, we stay here for now?"<br/><br/>"I'm afraid so," he answered. "Until we can get more information about this Brotherhood, our options are limited. We still don't know how they managed to track you to Ashenvale. We can't even be certain they haven't tracked us here."<br/><br/>Vectus took a deep breath and edged over to lean on the railing, gazing out onto the ocean himself in an attempt to collect his thoughts. He didn't even notice that Suni had also stepped up to the railing beside him until he only half-heard her ask a question.

"Oh? Sorry, I was a little distracted. What did you say?"<br/><br/>"It's understandable, given the circumstances." She smiled warmly and attempted to meet his gaze. "Something weighs heavily on your mind."<br/><br/>He glanced towards the girl momentarily before shifting his eyes back out to sea. "V'Ghera has put a reward out for the capture of Argustus."<br/><br/>"Is that bad?"<br/><br/>"He wouldn't put out a reward if he still thought I was bringing Fernand back to the Sanctum, as he bid. He knows something. I just don't know what. But he has to at least suspect me by now. In all of this, I've been so caught up that I've forgotten to keep him and the Modas occupied." Vectus paused and grit his teeth. "Damnit, I can't be everywhere at once."<br/><br/>"It's... okay," Suni said, in an effort to reassure him. "We've done our best."<br/><br/>"No, you don't get it." Vectus turned away and began to pace. "I have far more at stake than you, or Jonathan, or Timeus, or any of you."<br/><br/>Suni tried not to look wounded by his comment as she continued to watch him intently. After a moment, she asked, "And what does Aziel usually do to subjects who betray him?"<br/><br/>Vectus let out a long sigh. "I suppose it wouldn't hurt to be more forthcoming about who I am now that I've betrayed myself in telling you about my true nature." He came to a halt and rested his back against the railing before continuing. "But I'm not exactly just another one of his 'subjects.' I'm one of his Clavigers, you see."<br/><br/>She gave him a confused look, shaking her head. "I don't know what that means."<br/><br/>Noting her confusion, he explained, "The Clavigers are second in command of the Modas. Second only to Aziel himself."<br/><br/>Suni's reply came quickly. "I'm not surprised, really. You already told me you knew Mr. Argustus." Her reaction wasn't at all what he was expecting. She continued to hold his gaze and her tone hadn't changed at all. "I suppose every captain needs his first mate."<br/><br/>He shook his head, looking away. "No, it's not quite like that. Even his Clavigers he views as little more than tools, devices to be used."<br/><br/>"That's horrible."<br/><br/>"It's necessary."<br/><br/>"But, you're more than a simple tool. You're also a weapon. And yet, still--so much more." Suni moved to meet his gaze, smiling at him still. Vectus didn't understand why she did this. And she was so persistent, too. Turning to face her once more, he raised an eyebrow inquisitively.<br/><br/>Suni beamed at him, a mischievous light in her eye. "Tools--weapons--can't think for themselves. Therefore, I conclude you are more."<br/><br/>"I suppose I can't deny that logic." He managed a slight chuckle. "But I never said I was nothing more than a weapon. I only made an observation about V'Ghera's perspective."<br/><br/>"Well you can argue perspectives with Mr. V'Ghera when next you see him. I doubt I'll ever get the chance. I suspect he'd do something indescribably nasty to me."<br/><br/>"In all fairness, if he learned of any of this he would have me be the one to do those 'indescribably nasty' things to you. And Lilienne. And possibly Fernand too. As for me, well..."<br/><br/>"Something involving heads and spikes, I presume?"<br/><br/>"Perhaps for a normal tyrant. But this is Aziel V'Ghera." Vectus brought his hand up to massage his temple. "I haven't heard of any precedents of Clavigers betraying their High Karcist--Aziel--in this fashion. He probably wouldn't do anything right away, but I have no doubt he would make me pay, dearly, for this affront to his authority."<br/><br/>Suni's expression quickly turned solemn and grim. She spoke again, with as much seriousness as she could muster. "Should any of that come to pass, then, I shall trust you to take your time with me. It could buy Mr. Argustus time to escape with Lilienne."

The visit with Gondorin had left her with two new problems to worry about. Apparently Cyrus now had control of a scourge army based at Corin's Crossing and area. That was disconcerting enough. <br/><br/>Her second problem was the rumor about a nuclear device the Modas had been working on. She didn't even know what that was, but it was something those with a scientific mind worried about greatly. First the biological weapon they had used to plague Stormwind now something that could wipe out massive areas? <br/><br/>She had to check this out.

Everything had changed over the last few days. The small child hadn't known it would turn out like this, but she had known something was off when her teacher wasn't doing what Lord Aziel had requested of him. Lynnie needed to find out for herself what was wrong, which she set off to do. It took her several days, but she had finally seen him on his way, heading to Northrend. It was time for her to put her foot down and find out what he was doing. She had an idea, because all of it seemed quite obvious. '<em>Argustus is his friend. They want Argustus back because he did something very bad. Vectus hasn't come back with him.</em>'<br/><br/>Lynnie trailed Vectus to Dalaran. She lost track of him for a while, until she finally saw him walking around in the Legerdemain. She smirked, getting close to him. “I seeeee you,” she whispered, only loud enough for him to hear. She knew for once that she had caught her dear teacher off guard. He looked rather upset, but she still followed him up the stairs.<br/><br/>Many questions were asked, going back and forth for some time. Lynnie, for once, could see through his lies. It was upsetting that her beloved teacher was not interested in allowing her to help, when she knew that she was more than capable.<br/><br/>“Stop being stubborn! This is important!” Vectus whispered to her.<br/><br/>Lynnie shook her head. “So is learning stuff! 'Sides, I could help!”<br/><br/>“You can't help, you'll only make it more difficult.”<br/><br/>“Nuh-uh. I'm good at helpin'! 'Sides, didn't you see Mr. Lord Aziel's message?” She whispered back, her mind on the notion of all the possible gold from the bounty. It was much more than she usually got for her work.<br/><br/>Vectus, once again, hesitated and she knew something was wrong. “I... of course I saw it! But what does this have anything to do with this.”<br/><br/>The child gave him a rather pointed look, shaking her head as her voice raises to a normal tone. “Liar!” She cried out. <br/><br/>“Keep your voice down!”<br/><br/>Lynnie squeaked, her voice lowering once again, but she repeated her accusation in a whisper. “Liar!”<br/><br/>Vectus sighed, shaking his head. “Okay, fine. You have me, child. I will tell you, but you can't tell anyone.”<br/><br/>She responded with several enthusiastic nods, and crossing her heart. She sealed her lips, keeping her eyes on him hoping that she had finally gotten to him.<br/><br/>“I'm on a secret mission for Lord V'Ghera. No one knows I'm on it, just Lord V'Ghera and myself, and now you do too. No one can know that you know, though. Not even Lord Aziel. If you do tell him, he'll be mad at me because I told you.”<br/><br/>“So, what's the mission?”<br/><br/>“I can't tell you, girl! Light, have you been listening to anything I said?”<br/><br/>Lynnie became really upset by this. None of this was making any sense to her. “I've been listening, but all you've said is that you're on a secret mission! That doesn't explain anything!”<br/><br/>“It has to do with Fernand. That's all I can tell you. But you're smart, you already figured that out.”<br/><br/>Lynnie shook her head, somewhat in disbelief. None of this was right. “This doesn't make sense.”<br/><br/>“It doesn't have to!” Vectus whispered, a hint of rage in his tone.<br/><br/>“Yes it does!” She squeaked. But as she took a moment, looking at Vectus, thinking over the entire conversation, the child had a realization. '<em>He doesn't want Aziel to know about this. He doesn't want Aziel to know what he's doing with Argustus, and he's lying to me.</em>' The child froze as she made the realization, her head shaking a bit. '<em>He's helping him.</em>' “I think I gotta get back to the sanctum now. You know, like you said to do.”<br/><br/>Vectus looked at her when she took a step back, staring at the child. The look was once that would normally make her uncomfortable, but she showed no signs this time.<br/><br/>“...Think I gotta ask Mr. Lord Aziel something.”<br/><br/>“And what would that be?” <br/><br/>“I'm not telling <em>you</em> that!” The child hissed. “ 'Sides, I gotta get to work on that bounty!”<br/><br/>“There won't be a bounty. It has been harder than I thought, but I will be the one to bring Fernand back. Besides, if I couldn't do it, what makes you think you can?”<br/><br/>The child stared at her teacher blankly for a few moments, her suspicions confirmed. “ 'Cause, you're not trying to bring him back.”

Vectus was growing frustrated. She could see it as he rubbed his forehead. “And what makes you say that, girl?”<br/><br/>“ 'Cause you would have already.” She murmured, thinking to the first letter that she sent him, and how she had always known that he was the best to learn from. “Otherwise, you're not the best. And I don't doubt your abilities, so that ain't it.”<br/><br/>“Lynnie.” Vectus said, one of his hands going out to reach her shoulders.<br/><br/>“I can help!” She whined. Lynnie knew she could, even if it was betraying Lord Aziel. She didn't care about him that much, but she knew that she wanted to help Vectus in what he was doing. Not because it was the right thing to do, but because she knew she had to help her teacher in any way she could.<br/><br/>“I didn't want to have to do this.” Vectus stated.<br/><br/>Lynnie kept her gaze on Vectus, pleading with him to let her help. “I won't tell no one! I promise!” She murmured, hoping that her sincerity would allow him to change his mind. But Vectus' grasp tightened on her shoulder, and she began to squirm to break free as she saw him quickly grabbing for a syringe. Before she knew it, he had poked it into her side, releasing a poison into her body. Lynnie fought vigorously, but she could feel her body going numb, feel herself being pulled into a sleep. She writhed and squirmed until she finally fell limp in his arms, asleep.<br/><br/>-=-<br/><br/>Lynnie had dreams, mixes of times she recalled with Vectus, blurred with flight, and dragons. She whimpered and whined squirming until the effects of the poison ran it's course. By then, she couldn't tell where she was, only that she was propped up against some rather large feet. The child moved her head, looking up and seeing that she was leaning against a dragon. Her body tensed, and she let out an ear piercing shriek.<br/><br/>“You are... so impossible, child.” Vectus' voice rang familiar in her ear.<br/><br/>Everything still seemed to blur for Lynnie. She was left on her own with Vectus, the dragon going away at his will. The conversation continued as she tried to gain her bearings, but the child could not figure out where she was. There was green, and she was up high but she could see the ocean was not that far away. She couldn't make out what was inland from where they were, but she kept doing her best to observe as they continued their argument.<br/><br/>It felt like it went on for hours, and that her teacher simply was not listening to her. He brought the dragon over, whom she soon learned was not actually a dragon, but a human female named Suni. Apparently, he had befriended the woman, but Lynnie did not entirely understand it all. <br/><br/>“They're lying to you,” Bubbles whispered to child, in her ear. <br/><br/>Lynnie looked to her invisible friend, giving him a nod. “I know,” she whispered back. The child's look hardened, becoming quite cold, not what one would expect while looking upon the face of an eight year old girl. The child was tired of being lied to, especially by someone she was supposed to be learning from.<br/><br/>“If you don't know what you're doing, how could you possibly know people who are going to 'help'?” Vectus questioned her.<br/><br/>Lynnie kept her hardened look, really upset by all of this. Did he really know that little about her? “You know damn well that my Mama didn't want me to be with Modas and that I got a lot of friends who hate Modas! It would be easy to convince them to help!”<br/><br/>The look on his face changed, and for once, the child had known that she had truly gotten the better of him. He calmed, almost to the point of an inability to speak. “I-” he started, realizing what the child was offering. “I hadn't considered this.”<br/><br/>Lynnie's arms crossed. “I got a lot to learn from ya, but you know I like most everyone! I still got a lot to learn but you know I'm not stupid! So stop underestimating me and let me help!”<br/><br/>Vectus turned to face the water with the woman. She could hear them whispering. She watched them, idly pulling out her favorite ragdoll and hugging it to her chest. Lynnie could hear Bubbles whispering into her ear. <br/>“They don't want you to help them, Lynnie. They think you're too young.” He said. The child gave a small whimper, looking up to her friend for a moment before noticing Vectus had turned around once again.<br/><br/>“Lynnie. I have something very important to tell you.”<br/><br/>The child straightened herself out, nodding to show she was ready to listen to him.<br/><br/>“Suni here- She's Fernand's daughter.”

Lynnie took a moment to look at her curiously, slightly confused by this. As far as she knew, Fernand was rather old, and undead. “How can he have a daughter?”<br/><br/>“He wasn't always undead, you know.”<br/><br/>“Oh.” She gave a small nod.<br/><br/>“You see, a lot of people are after her right now. Because they think they can use her as leverage over Mr. Argustus.”<br/><br/>Lynnie looked to Suni, who nodded to her. The child frowned deeply. “That is not very nice of them.”<br/><br/>“I have to protect her, Lynnie. Whatever happens to Argustus, he wants to keep his daughter safe.”<br/><br/>“Where is he?” She asked, finally sensing that she had the truth from her teacher.<br/><br/>“I don't know. I was looking for him when you found me.” He murmured. “Do you know, Lynnie? I would...”<br/><br/>The child shook her head. “But you can always find people.”<br/><br/>The pair went back and forth, even with Suni stepping in to defend Fernand. But when it came down to it, they couldn't really settle it. Lynnie was completely thrown off by all of this. Lynnie knew she wasn't going to get much out of this, she was fairly certain that Fernand Argustus didn't even like her. But she felt the need to impress Vectus, even though she hated all of these changes.<br/><br/>“Are you gonna go back?” She asked him, eying the man.<br/><br/>“I don't know yet.” <br/><br/>That answer burned her. She had finally settled into Modas, she had finally found someone she had impressed enough to teach her so she could do what it was that her adoptive mother wanted her to do. Lynnie had to know if he would still be able to teach her. “Do I still get to learn from ya?”<br/><br/>Vectus hesitated with the answer. “I... don't know yet.”<br/><br/>That was it. It was enough for the child, more than she could take right now. She quickly stood up, vanishing in a puff of smoke and running off. She could hear shouts from both Vectus and Suni, but she did not answer either of them. She continued running, staying out of sight. Her hands went to her belt, where she quickly got on her hearthstone, whispering to Bhayne about what happened. About how Vectus had kidnapped her from Dalaran, how she didn't know where she was and how she was scared. She mixed the lies and truths as it was so easy for her to do, but after describing the area, Bhayne figured out where she was. <br/><br/>Lynnie had been found once again, but even though she was thoroughly upset with Vectus, her plan to get help for him had worked. Bhayne had come to Sholazar Basin, with Raoul, and found her. The situation was explained, and things were sorted out. The child allowed them to talk, though she sulked through it all. She knew that this wasn't about her, but she still felt betrayed, and more hurt than she had ever felt before in her short lifetime. She had thought that Vectus was going to keep teaching her until she was as good as he is, but now nothing seemed certain. <br/><br/>When everything was settled- where Vith and Suni would be heading to next, and what they could do, Lynnie had another shock to her system.<br/><br/>“Lynnie, you are not to go back to the Sanctum.” Vectus insisted. <br/><br/>The child had a look of confusion on her face, and she shook her head.<br/><br/>“You will stay with Raoul and Bhayne for now.”<br/><br/>“We'll have a sleepover, Lynnie! Won't that be fun?” Bhayne chimed up.<br/><br/>Lynnie stood up, sighing. She did not want to have a sleepover with Bhayne, nor did she want to be banned from going back to the sanctum. She just wanted everything to go back to how it had been before all of this had happened. The child eyed Bhayne and Raoul, but soon found herself being whisked away with promises that she would be allowed to see Vith and Suni again the next day.
