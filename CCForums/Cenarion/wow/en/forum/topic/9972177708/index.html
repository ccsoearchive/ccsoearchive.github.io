The great Library in Dalaran had many things in it that fascinated Hahnai Dawnsinger. The sheer amount of records kept of the history of the elves was astounding. Row upon row of shelves and cases full of books and tomes. Ancient manuscripts kept under glass and sealed with magic.<br/><br/>Her search was of a personal nature, she was seeking the source of the magic that gave her the ability to see into the future. It was not a constant, nor was it infallible. Little things had occurred over the years that hammered into her that the "gift" was capricious. She often called it the "curse" instead.<br/><br/>She could without very much trouble, ascertain what the weather would be like for a coming week. She did not go about telling anyone this, as it almost seemed as if she were causing the weather to change.<br/><br/>The efforts on the war front she often knew about, but did not like to tell anyone about either. The few attempts she had made to keep people safe often led to greater disasters. She knew that the Horde would be losing a warchief, but who would replace him would shock most to their very core. She opted to stay out of politics, it was much safer.<br/><br/>But the greatest disturbance she had was the voices of the dead. The whispers and cries, the taunts and screams had kept her from getting a good nights rest without resorting to drugs. It had only been recently with the aid of A'Dal the Naaru, that she had been able to quiet the voices with some simple mind tricks.<br/><br/>The one thing that stayed with her for the most part was the lute. It was a beautiful instrument, carved and finished with exquisite detail. The strings were of some enchanted silvery metal that always seemed to be in perfect tune. It had a braided and embroidered strap that held it in place so she could strum it and sing.<br/><br/>The first time she had sung for others it had taken her completely by surprise. A rowdy tavern in the Booty Bay had quieted and listened in rapt attention to her songs. They had even tipped her with handfuls of coppers and silvers, even a gold coin or two. It was there that the first evidence of the magic of the lute presented itself.<br/><br/>She had gone into a trance and sang a song of twisted fate. A woman had ran away to join her lover who was a sailor, but he had drowned at sea and she was lost in the wilderness. It had been days later that the young girl had been found. She had been captured by trolls and actually rescued by the sailors from the ship that had taken her love from her.<br/><br/>Hahnai was still not sure if her song was a way for the young human girl to be rescued or just a coincidence. The fact several of the sailors friends were in the tavern and recognized their friend in the song could not be explained. That they actually went out looking for the poor girl was a good thing. Actually rescuing her was a miracle.<br/><br/>(continued)

The finding of the lute was one of the memories she puzzled over every so often. The ruins in the mountains of Tirisfal were not easily accessible. She had been looking for herbs and found a path that led up one obscure mountain. It was a faint trail, she thought maybe a path worn by elk or deer. But something urged her to follow it.<br/><br/>Not too far down the trail she grew weary and stopped to rest. Taking out a flask of water she sat on a fallen log and looked around. Suddenly she realized she had no idea where she was! The path was still there in front of her, but the way back seemed to have vanished. She stood and tried to remember which way she had come, but all she could see was the path forward.<br/><br/>Her heart thumped in her chest with not a small amount of fear. It was past noon now and the day would be over before she found a way back. She pushed forward, maybe she would find someone or something to guide her home. <br/><br/>Another two hours and she finally found a clearing of sorts. At least it was open rather than closely packed with trees. Tall grasses and something that looked like an old building up ahead. The path was still there but very faint. She continued to follow it, marveling at all the flowers growing everywhere. A few large pine trees with branches all the way to the base surrounded a very large old mansion. It looked to have been very fancy in its day. <br/><br/>The crumbling rock walls and broken gate did not stop her from investigating onto the grounds. Overgrown gardens of vegetables and flowers surrounded the three story tall building. The entryway was a double door with unlit lanterns on either side of it. The mansion appeared very old, but actually sturdy. Construction was mostly stone with some wooden accents.<br/><br/>Cautiously Hahnai approached the doors. There was dust and leaves on the porch, she doubted anyone had been here in many years. With trembling hands she reached for the handle of one of the doors. To her surprise it was unlocked! The hinges creaked a protest as she swung the door open. Inside was gloom and dust everywhere. Spider webs covered every nook and cranny, though they appeared to be ordinary spiders. <br/><br/>The furniture was fancy in its day, carved fine wood and embroidered cushions. There were faded pictures on the walls, mostly landscapes. But there was not sign of anyone living here recently. She wondered what had happened to the residents? As she moved into the rooms she opened curtains moldy and full of dust to let in some light.<br/><br/>The stairway leading to the upper floor was a grand thing spiraling up one side of the room. As Hahnai explored she felt she was intruding on someone, even though she saw no evidence of anyone currently living there. The first level consisted of an entryway with a closet that held a few old coats and an umbrella stand. There were three umbrellas there, but they did not seem to be in very good shape. The entryway led to a grand open room with the staircase on one side, and huge fireplace in the center of one wall. Doors led off into other rooms, a kitchen and pantry took up most of the space other than the great room. She found a study that was tucked under the stairwell. <br/><br/>(to be continued)

When she opened the door to the study, she nearly gasped in astonishment! Floor to ceiling shelves of books covered every wall. In the center of the library was a desk and a comfy chair. A large lamp that would give off plenty of light was unlit on the wall behind the desk. On the desk was a fine plumed quill pen in a stand next to a dried up bottle of ink. Under a colorful rock was a sheet of parchment, curled on the edges and left for someone to find.<br/><br/>Hahnai looked around the room and her eyes glazed over at the variety of books here. She loved to read and this was like a dream come true. She went to the desk and looked at the parchment, it appeared to be written in Common. A wave of disappointment hit her. This was probably an old human mansion then. She could not read Common, or understand it. Vaguely she wondered who had lived here? Perhaps some Lorderon noble? <br/><br/>Sighing in frustration she moved out of the study and began to climb the stairway. The rich carpet was dusty and her footprints marked in the dust as she walked. The second floor was several rooms with doors shut. She looked over the balcony to the floor below and mused how wonderful it might have been to live here at one time. There were faded pictures on the walls and small tables holding vases of now dried flowers. Chandeliers of crystal and small lamps here and there. <br/><br/>With fears shoved aside, her curiosity made her open each door to the rooms and peer inside. Four spacious bedrooms with large closets, and it appeared that clothing was very old and fancy. But years had reduced them to fragile things that fell apart when touched. Beds were large and bedding was colorful but dusty. The windows were shuttered and she opened each window to let in the light.<br/><br/>The last door on the far end opened to another set of stairs leading up to another floor. Hahnai noted the stairwell was very dark, she picked up a small lamp with a candle inside. In a drawer she found flint and steel to light it. The tiny flame when covered by the glass globe lit up the area quite well. Carrying the candle in its holder she began to ascend the stairs. The old wooden steps creaked beneath her feet. A door at the top opened to reveal a huge storage attic. Trunks and barrels of things unknown were stacked along the walls. A few oil lamps were spaced around here and there.<br/><br/>One particular trunk caught her eyes as she entered the room. It was gaily painted with animals and figures that appeared dressed in outlandish costumes. Hahnai approached and lit the lamp near the trunk, setting the candle on the other side so she could see well. The lid was heavy but she managed to lift it up to peer inside. Clothing was neatly folded, appearing to be in fine shape. Beautiful blues and greens in shimmering silks. Fine beadwork decorated the seams and made colorful patterns. There were gloves and other accessories to match the fine gowns inside. Under some of the clothing she found a case, it was oddly shaped and she pulled it forth.<br/><br/>(continued)

The case contained a lute. Hahnai ran her fingers over the fine instrument. It was a work of art, carved and finished with great care. The strings were of some silvery metal, and to Hahnai's untrained fingers, they sounded marvelous. She fingered the strap that was used to hold the instrument in place so the musician could play it. The thought of learning to play such a fine instrument flitted through her mind.<br/><br/>Pulling the lute from the case she fitted the strap over her head and strummed the strings lightly. To her surprise the instrument sounded joyous! Almost as if it was sentient and pleased to have someone strumming it. She played it softly and experimented with the frets on the neck of the lute. She had never had a lesson in her life, but somehow it sounded beautiful to her ears. It was heavenly to her and she sat there and played with it for seemingly hours. <br/><br/>It occurred to her then that time was dragging inexorably onward. She was in a mansion, deserted by its owners for many years and lost in the mountains of Tirisfal! She felt her heart thump in her chest as she contemplated her predicament. She wanted to learn more of this place, but she had to return home to Silvermoon. Then she remembered that there was no one there anyway to miss her. <br/><br/>The day was drawing to an end when she realized she was hungry and thirsty. Putting the lute back in its case she took it with her and blew out the oil lamp. Picking up the candle she made her way back down the stairs. All the way to the lower floor and into the kitchen. There was a stove there, needing wood of course. A doorway to the outside revealed a garden of herbs. Setting the lute in its case on the table, she looked around and found an old but serviceable wood axe. <br/><br/>Finding wood and chopping it into suitable size for the stove took her another hour. She also discovered a small spring nearby and filled her water skins. Knowing herbs as well as she did the ones growing in the garden were great for tea. Gathering a few more to dry for use later, she dug up a few root vegetables and some onions. If nothing else she would have a veggie stew. Humming a cheerful tune she went back to the kitchen and filled the woodstove and lit it. Her small tea kettle and stew pot were soon simmering. Vaguely she hoped she would find a way home, but something told her this was far more interesting. <br/><br/>(continued)

The dining room was much too fancy for Hahnai, so she stayed in the kitchen and ate her stew and drank her tea. It was sometime later that she wandered back into the great room and looked around. Almost without thinking she started cleaning it, using a broom and rags she found in the kitchen. She took curtains down and carried them outside to shake out the dust, the breeze helping her to carry it away. The cobwebs were dealt with and a brush and a bit of elbow grease soon had the furniture dusted enough to sit and relax.<br/><br/>It was nearing dark when she realized she liked being here and would probably make it her new home. She relaxed enough to lay back on the couch and fall asleep. At first the dreams she had were ordinary and innocent. Then a subtle change occurred, they became darker and whispers filtered through her mind of something she did not understand. <br/><br/>Tossing restlessly she awoke when something cool touched her forehead. Opening her eyes she was startled to see a face peering into hers. It was an old face, a human who had seem many years. Hahnai opened her mouth to scream, but a hand clamped over her mouth to stop it. "Nooo...do not fear...I will not harm you..." the voice of the human was weakened by age, but her hand covering Hahnai's mouth was firm but gentle.<br/><br/>Hahnai tried to relax, her eyes blinking in unease. The old woman smiled down at her. "I am glad to see someone has found us after all these years. We have been waiting a very long time." she removed her hand then and turned to gaze around the room. <br/><br/>At first Hahnai did not see anyone else, then they started appearing around her. But they were only spirits, translucent and floating in the way of ghosts. The whispers grew excited as the milled around the room. Hahnai sat up and shivered in her light dress. The old woman looked back to her and nodded. "You are chilled dear, understandable, you have no fire going. Perhaps you should light one in the fireplace? I will see if I can find you a blanket." And with a gliding motion which revealed her to be yet another spirit, the old woman floated away.<br/><br/>Still trembling with what she knew was more fear than cold, Hahnai moved to the fireplace and noted that kindling and wood were already set on it. Just needing a spark to set it blazing cheerfully, which she did with shaking fingers. The warmth of the fire cheered her and warmed her enough to turn to gaze at the spirits floating around her. Flickering eyes followed her every movement, but none appeared to be harmful to her. It was with some curiousity she noted they all spoke in whispers to each other, in a language she did not know.<br/><br/>The old woman returned with an armful of warm blankets, which she laid on the couch where Hahnai had been sleeping. "I do not blame you for not sleeping in any of the beds. They are full of bugs and dust. Here, come back and warm yourself under a blanket. We need to talk." She waited patiently until Hahnai returned to the couch and sat down. The blankets were wool and very cozy. She snuggled down into the nest of blankets and gazed at the old woman.<br/><br/>(continued)

Suddenly the thoughts coming into her head made it spin in confusion. She looked at the old woman, who now appeared to be a spirit as well.<br/><br/>"So you have found it. The Lute of Foretelling it is called. It will teach you to play, and it will give you songs to sing. The words are prophetic if you have the talent to decipher them. Often in riddles and sometimes misleading." the voice coming from the old woman was full of sadness.<br/><br/>"Who are you? Why does this lute seem to feel so good in my hands? You say it as if it was meant for me...I don't even know how to play it." Hahnai was confused.<br/><br/>"Of course you do not...the Lute seeks those with strong hearts and minds. Those of honor and intelligence. A good bit of common sense is good as well. It might have called you...I am sure it was intended for you to find it. Now what will you do with it?" the form of the woman seemed reluctant to stay long, it flickered in and out of sight.<br/><br/>"I...I don't know. What am I supposed to do with it?" her voice curious and bolder now. She did not fear the spirit. <br/><br/>"Play the lute...listen to your heart. See what happens. Be careful though. The ability to foretell the future will attract the wrong kind of people. Sometimes it is better to remain silent and not sing...merely play the lute. See what happens. Light be with you child..." and the spirit dissolved into nothing.<br/><br/>Hahnai gasped as the spirit disappeared. How was she supposed to know what to do? She huddled in the blanket and laid back down on the couch. The spirits whispered at her and some even cried and begged, a few even screamed. She prayed to the Light to keep her safe and for some reason the spirits drifted away for a time, quieting as if they feared the Light.<br/><br/>Sleep was brief however as the new dawn came within a few hours. Sunlight streaming into the windows fell across her face and woke her gently. Sitting up and looking around she realized she could not stay here. The spirits would not let her sleep well. She gathered her things and picked up the lute in its case. "I will take this with me, it seems to call to me in a way I have never experienced. If I learn to play it then maybe I will figure this whole thing out."<br/><br/>She decided to check the attic one more time and opened the trunk. To her surprise there was a gown of such stunning blue color she had to have it. The trunk also contained a small jewelry box. Inside was an amulet, it was carved of blue quartz and had the shape of the lute. She took the gown and the amulet she drew over her head. There was also a very soft wool cloak that matched the gown. Packing them into her bags she shut the old trunk and went back downstairs.<br/><br/>(continued)

It took her only a few hours to make her way back to Undercity and from there to Silvermoon. She found a tutor in music and learned a few things about the lute. She found she had a natural talent for it, either that or it was true the lute itself was enchanted to help her play.<br/><br/>Her life became one of the wanderer, as she sought new songs to play and new places to explore. It grew hard to concentrate at times, when she found a place that had a lot of restless spirits. They would clamor for her attention and made it hard for her to sleep.<br/><br/>The bustling fortress of Orgrimmar was no different. The Wyvern's Tale seemed a good place to make new friends and to sing.<br/><br/>The last night in the Wyvern's Tale had been very strange. She had been singing a sweet ballad and suddenly felt the lute shift in her hands. She only faltered a moment and then the lute seemed to take on a mind of its own. Her fingers seemed to be guided as she strummed a slightly different melody.<br/><br/>Her eyes glazed over and she could not see for a moment. Going into a trance as her voice lifted in a song that told of the horrors of war. A warning to all who fought in the bloody campaign to level Theramore. Retribution was on its way. And the guard who sat near her scowled. <br/><br/>"The humans are fools!! They do not know how to stay away from our lands!! They killed innocents and destroyed the small settlement in the Barrens called Taurajo. The Horde will not sit still as we are attacked! We will wipe their presence from our lands!!" he was boisterous and proud.<br/><br/>When she recovered her senses she sat stunned as the crowd glared at her. What had she done? The innkeeper was also not happy. A bouncer came to her with her few pitiful belongings and escorted her out the door. "Go now and be grateful we do not toss you to the crocs in the Southfury River."<br/><br/>Setting off for the south she passed Razor Hill and headed to the troll islands. She did not realize it until she stopped that a troll rogue had followed her.<br/><br/>"Mon, ya need ta sing fer da trolls, we like yer music...we be more open to yer kind den ya tink. I hafta say, ya be not welcome in Orgrimmar anymore...but mebbe ya kin find a mate ta keep ya safe on da road. Check wit da innkeepa heah...she be feeding ya fer a song and help ya figga out dat song stuff...ye be a seer of sorts...I am guessin' mebbe."<br/><br/>Hahnai was grateful to the troll and spent a few days talking to the trolls. They loved music and singing and taught her a few of their songs to sing. The lively witchdoctor who coached her on the singing did tell her to find someone to watch her back and guard her, someone who could keep her safe when she did her foretelling. The news of her talent had spread around to the other trolls and they revered her as a seer.<br/><br/>There was one incident of a foretelling that was unexpected and met with some scowls. She told of a troll dying at the hands of an Orc. They seemed to almost expect this and mumblings of revolt against the Horde leadership reached her ears. She decided to move on and traveled to the small settlement of Ratchet. <br/><br/>The goblins took advantage of her singing and she stayed there for several days. She made enough coin to book passage on the ferry to Booty Bay. Sailing songs were easily learned and sung on the trip over to the other continent.

It was not a good place, the drunks were rowdy, the smell was atrocious, but the beautiful music drifting from the lute in her hands made heads turn and smiles abound. Hahnai Shadowstar hummed softly as she strummed the instrument. Words came every so often, mostly snatches of songs she had heard in the past. <br/><br/>Those around her did not seem interested in anything but drinking and gambling. She provided an ambiance to the tavern that the Innkeeper liked. He had offered her a room for half price to sit there and play. The only problem was, she needed to make enough in tips to pay for her room.<br/><br/>The song she felt coming to her mind was subtle. It started out as a ballad, a brave young man who went to sea. He is far away from his love and lamenting the fact he is dying and cannot get back to her. As her lovely voice lifted in the sad song the tavern became quiet as each person turned to her and listened. Only the sound of her lute and voice could be heard. <br/><br/>There were not a few teary eyes as she finished the song. One sailor got up and approached the stage. "Ye be a sad singer...but it seem I might know who ye sing about...a fine lad who died at sea. Have a coin and a drink on me...to remember him. Thank ye for bringing his tale to light. His name was..."<br/><br/>Before he could say a name she reached out with a soft hand and held it to his lips. "No do not tell me a name. This is a song written long ago and far away. It is a song for every sailor who has not been able to return home...thanks for the coin, drink the cup of mead for me."<br/><br/>He stood stunned a moment and nodded. Her touch was sweet and he sat near her, drinking the mead and smiling as she strummed a more lively tune. The tavern erupted into boisterous singing a few moments later as she played a rollicking drinking song.<br/><br/>She had not forgotten the troll sitting on the floor, and as she finished the song for the elves, she turned to him with a bright smile. "Ya mon, I be singin' da troll songs from da Echo Isles jus' fer joo!" her attempt at a troll dialect a comical thing coming from a Sindorei. She then launched into a chant that the trolls had sung as they called for spiritual guidance. Her fingers on the lute strumming a background of a strong beat resembling the drums of the trolls.<br/><br/>The young sailor at her left scowled as he heard her singing Horde songs. He had become enamored of her and wanted to hear something from Stormwind. "Sing a sailor song again! I have heard many songs from Stormwind to Lorderon of old. Remember Theramore!!" he shouted as he stood to glare at the Sindorei.<br/><br/>The goblin bouncers moved towards him to subdue the drunken sailor. Hahnai was startled and stopped playing the troll song to stare at the young human. He had evidently forgotten she was also a Sindorei. She spoke quietly to him to calm him down. "We are all friends here, peace my new friend. We only want to enjoy the fine tavern and the company of new friends. I have not been to Stormwind, I do not imagine I could walk in there safely." she smiled and started strumming a calming melody.

The tinkle of coins filling her jar made Hahnai smile sweetly. She continued to strum the lute and nodded at the fine Sindorei who asked for livelier tunes. Her mind whirling a little as the troll spoke she caught the sound of bones being tossed. She was curious as she had seen some of the troll witchdoctors in the Echo Isles do the casting. <br/><br/>Her strumming grew slower as she strummed now softly. Without a falter in her playing her eyes took on a far off glaze. Her fingers picked out a haunting melody, intricate and precise. Her voice when she lifted it to sing seemed a little different. The words were clear and all in the room heard them.<br/><br/>There is one who sails the seas,<br/>His name is never known.<br/>A dagger that is never pleased,<br/>Till blood is shed before the dawn.<br/><br/>Twice the silver, half the gold,<br/>A maiden sings a song.<br/>Deadly blade, hand so bold,<br/>Two rights will make a wrong.<br/><br/>Never spoken of in Light,<br/>All will be revealed.<br/>A messenger will be in flight,<br/>Lover's Fate be sealed.<br/><br/>Her voice was silenced and her fingers continued to strum the haunting melody for a few more minutes. She then stopped and looked around as if waking from a dream. Her eyes blinked and she noticed everyone was looking at her. She coughed a few times and reached for her mug of mead.<br/><br/>She appeared puzzled and unsure for a few moments and then shrugged it off, taking to strumming the lute again as if nothing had happened. She hummed softly, trying to think of a cheerful song.

The Sin'dorei priest had settled on a table in the corner of the second floor of the Salty Sailor. Booty Bay was a curiousity to the priest, and he found himself coming here to enjoy the intermingling of the races and factions. There were not too many places one could relax and observe your opponent in their leisure or shopping methods. <br/><br/>Azmos had chosen the second floor, as it wasn't nearly as rowdy as the first floor with all the drunken sailors, and such. However, he had noted there was someone strumming a lute upon the stage and he listened for the strains of its melodies as he sipped the cool amber wine before him. Cosmo had curled up on his shoulder and snuggled close to his neck, and the blood elf smiled warmly at his diminutive little dragon.<br/><br/>Suddenly he noticed that there was a quietness about the place. The melody was clear, and her voice carried all the way back to his table. He listened as her lovely voice sang a soft riddle. Azmos listened and he remembered and memorized the tune and words, even as her fingers closed the music softly, and he could hear the sounds of the patrons begin anew. What had just happened?<br/><br/>Az picked up his glass and made his way to the creaky wood stairs down to the main room. As he passed the waitress that had serviced him, he pressed a gold piece into her hand, and thanked her. He did not stop to see her staring at his retreating form as he made his way down.<br/><br/>At the landing he scanned the room, noting the variety of customers the establishment had this evening, and he nodded to a group of fellow blood elves. Then his eyes fell upon her, the one who was still strumming on a lute, singing a simple bar tune. He looked around once again, and noted there didn't seem to be the silence that had occurred moments before.<br/><br/>What was it about that song? Had it been the melody or the lyrics? Or had it been the woman that sat on the stool? He was curious, and proceeded down the stairs and made his way to a table that was close to the stage where she sang. <br/><br/>Her voice was sweet, and had a certain presence to it. But to grab the attention of everyone, he didn't feel that sensation of being almost mesmerized by the music as he had before. He finished the wine he had carried down with him and called for another one. As he watched her, he awoke the little dragon, and gave it a coin and pointed to the small container before her on the stage. <br/><br/>Cosmo flew over the crowd and settled over the open jar, and let the coin fall. He hovered briefly, as he looked at the woman playing, then pirouetted in the air and flew back to Az. As the celestial dragon settled on his shoulder, Azmos nodded to the bard and smiled as she played on.<br/><br/>When she finished and disappeared upstairs, Azmos ordered a simple meal, and ate in silence. He asked about the singer and if she would be returning, and he was assured that she would indeed be back. He sipped the cool amber wine, and sat waiting, stroking the pale blue transparent dragon on its chest, listening to its gentle growling as he did. Cosmo's eyes closed as Az's finger kept up the gentle petting.<br/><br/>She appeared rested and she smiled as she sat back upon the stool. As she strummed the lute she grew quiet, and the strain of notes she played grew more complicated, then she began to sing. Azmos watched her, and realized it was the same song from before, and he noticed it was having the same effect on the patrons. This time he saw a shimmering about her as her voice rose and fell in her singing. And he smiled, listening carefully again.

He was curious concerning the lute she held, and its magic. Az wondered of it giving her flawless performance on any song, but he had heard her voice, and he knew it was not just the lute. She had so much potential with a voice like that.<br/><br/>He sipped his wine, and reached into his robes to pull out a long slender recorder. The rich dark wood reflected the lighting in the large bar room, and Az slipped his fingers around the slender flute-like instrument. As he brought it up to his lips, he smiled once to the singer playing on the stage. <br/><br/>Hahnai was playing an old tavern standard, the story of two star crossed lovers, and as she sang, he began to play. The notes were clear and soft, as they flowed from the recorder. As the melodious sound followed and accompanied her, it did not overpower her voice, nor her lute, instead it seemed to join in, and Azmos' head swayed with the tempo of the music. The flute merely added a richness to her singing and playing. <br/><br/>When she finished the song, Az noticed she smiled at him. And a few patrons patted him on the shoulder, "Aye, now that's more like it. More, play some more!" And Azmos looked up at Hahnai and smiled. His lips pucked over the mouthpiece and he began to play once again.<br/><br/>The sound was gay and light, the tempo quick and lively, as the notes began to soar and fall, an old Sin'dorei dance tune became evident. As he played, Az nodded his head to Hahnai to join him in the music, the recorder sounded like a happy bird singing it's heart out, as his fingers danced over the instrument and the fingerholes.

The patrons were being very kind and Hahnai was happy. She sang her heart out and carefully strummed the magical lute. Her pretty teal eyes met the gaze of anyone who cam forward and she never missed a beat or clear note of the song she was singing. <br/><br/>These were simple songs and her voice was angelic, the lute adding the special quality by making it impossible for her to make a mistake. When the celestial dragonling swept up to her she grinned in delight and trilled a sweet counter to its chirp. Glancing at the Sindorei in the corner she tilted her head and nodded in appreciation. The tips would make all the difference in the world to her. Giving her an opportunity to continue her journey.<br/><br/>When Azmos joined her in the next song on his recorder she smiled at him and nodded. He played it very well and she could tell he was an accomplished musician. Her voice was not drowned out by the sweet notes, but almost seemed enhanced by his playing. Vaguely she wondered if the flute was magic as well? At least the smile he gave her seemed to be.<br/><br/>The song was done and Hahnai beckoned to the white haired elf to join her on the stage. She wanted to meet him and examine the flute. Leaning over to the bartender she whispered. "Get that one a drink, he plays beautifully. Ask him to join me here?" her voice hopeful.<br/><br/>Her thoughts whirled as she strummed the lute, was he the one who would accompany her on her adventures? He was handsome as all Sindorei are, but his visage showed compassion and wisdom as well. His robes were fine and well tailored, she thought maybe a mage. Then her eyes caught the aura of the Light around him. He was a priest! And as she smiled and sang a sweet melody of spring and the renewal of the seasons after winter's bite, she hoped he would join her.

When Hahnai motioned for Azmos to join him, he looked around at the other patrons, unsure of how her invitation would be received. But he need not have worried as they egged him on to get up there and play for them all. <br/><br/>Cosmo flew around his head as he made his way to the small stage where Hahnai sat waiting. He bowed towards her graciously, then sat on the chair beside her. When he was seated, Cosmo came to rest upon his shoulder, and he chirped excitedly towards Hahnai. <br/><br/>Azmos listened to the tune Hahnai was singing, and brought the recorder to his lips. The notes were faint at first as he followed her lead, then the melody grew, however his flute always accompanied Hahnai's sweet voice, never running over the song or her voice. As she came to the end of the spring song, he lightly finished with a brief flourish.<br/><br/>As Hahnai took a sip of her mead, Azmos smiled, then began to play a soft and quiet tune that reminded one more of a child's lullabye than a bar tune. The notes began to weave around the melody, and became sweeter and more intense. Then Azmos stood and began to move and sway, the tempo quickening, and as he played he noticed several of the patrons tapping their fingers, or nodding their heads.<br/><br/>The tune switched up to a familiar bar song of drinking and friendship, and Az bobbed his head and tapped his foot as the music began to soar and sing. The notes flew faster and faster, and just when you couldn't believe someone's finger's moving so quickly over the recorder's valves...it stopped. Then the soft, quiet tune returned, gentle and calming, and slowly faded to a long lingering note.<br/><br/>Azmos blinked as he lowered the recorder, and looked at Hahnai. The song seemed to have been well received as several coins found their way to the jar near Hahnai's chair. And Az slowly sat down, and in a deep warm whisper he spoke to Hahnai, "That's never happened before, what just occurred?"<br/><br/>The priest reached down to sip from his glass, and found it empty. As he looked towards the bartender, a waitress held a glass up to him, and Az gave her the empty glass, and then took the full one. He winked at her, and thanked her softly in his deep voice. She smiled and moved through the rest of the patrons, picking up glasses, and taking orders for more drink.<br/><br/>Azmos sipped the wine slowly as he looked at the comely young girl beside him, as she strummed her lute. She certainly had great skill with it, as her fingers moved over the strings plucking out a melody yet, setting a background melody with it at the same time.<br/><br/>He could not help smiling as she played, and he set his glass down to join her with his recorder. He listened carefully before he began playing softly and accompanied her. He had never had so much fun as he was right now playing with her in the notes and music.

As she watched him move to the stage, Hahnai noted the tiny dragonling again flitting around him and settling on his shoulder. She admired the creature, it was beautiful and seemed intelligent. Her eyes lit up with pleasure as he trilled along with the music.<br/><br/>The handsome face of the elf sitting beside her was open and friendly. She could not help but respond to the kindness and warmth in his green eyes. She strummed quietly a few moments and saw that he was a quick study and seemed to know where she was going with the music. Was the flute also magical?<br/><br/>Smiling as he joined in and humming a bit of nonsense as she went through several complicated riffs, she dared him to keep up with her. The slight teasing challenge in her eyes rewarded with his skill. Nodding she stopped for a moment and allowed him to set the tone as she sipped her mead.<br/><br/>He was very skilled and the melody he began was one familiar to her. She joined him and the song was interesting and challenging. Not once did she falter or miss a note. When he changed to a rollicking bit to get the patrons stomping their feet and more than one got up to dance, she had to giggle.<br/><br/>His switch back to the quieter melody was almost magical on its own. The patrons settled down and coins flew into her little jar. "Thank you! Thank you all! So very kind." she had to thank each one giving her coins and smiled at the crowd.<br/><br/>Her gaze turned to the one beside her and a questioning look filled her eyes. "I am Hahnai Dawnsinger. How nice of you to join me. You are a very skilled musician. I think I have enough now to travel onward. I think I may make my way back to Kalimdor and maybe to Thunderbluff. Would you care to join me? I have an insane wanderlust. I hear the Tauren like to sing and dance as well. I would like to learn from them."<br/><br/>Her teal eyes were expressive as she hoped he would say yes. It occurred to her she knew nothing of this elf other than he was a good musician. But she saw the little dragonling with him and somehow it seemed an indication of his good heart. She felt she could trust him.

The holy priest took a sip of the sweet wine the waitress brought over, then turned to the bard beside her. His voice was deep and warm as he spoke, "I am Azmos Whitemane, you may call me Az if you like. I have never felt so wonderful with my recorder as I have tonight. While it is enchanted, it has never allowed me to play like that. I like it."<br/><br/>He sipped once more as she continued to strum a familiar ditty common to most taverns and inns, and he found himself humming briefly. <br/><br/>"Thunder Bluff? I would be enchanted to go there once more. I love their calm and pleasant natures. It would be my pleasure to accompany you there."<br/><br/>He sat his mug of wine down, and set the recorder beside it. He stood and hummed deeply, then he began to sing the song in a deep rich voice. A song of the road, the inns he had been to, and the taverns and ales he had drank. He caught the eye of the goblin waitress, and sang of a love that could never be for the road was his love and his lady. He quietly repeated the chorus and let it fade, as he took his seat and picked up his wine to wet his throat.<br/><br/>Some of the patrons smiled, and brought a few more coin to Hahnai's cup. "Aye matey, the road, she be my mistress, just as the sea be me wife." and several overhearing that began to laugh.<br/><br/>He turned to Hahnai, "I would love to go with you. If you will have me."

The joy spread across her face as Hahnai gazed into his warm eyes. She felt an instinctive trust immediately for this elf. The kindness and compassion shown from him as bright as the aura of the Light surrounding him. "Thank you Az, please call me Hani, I am just a lowly priest with an enchanted lute. But I think we make beautiful music together!"<br/><br/>Continuing to strum softly she sang more of the ballads of love lost and found. Her sweet voice cheered the crowd one moment and had them in tears the next. The lute seemed to respond to Az in a good way. Perhaps it was influencing him as well?<br/><br/>They were able to get enough gold together to book passage on the next ferry to Kalimdor. A few nights in Ratchet were spent singing and getting to know each other. Separate rooms were found and Hahnai dreamed of spending more time on the road now she had a partner. There were still nightmares at times and she hoped he did not hear her cries in the night.<br/><br/>As time went by she became more comfortable talking to him about the dreams. "Azmos, I sometimes have trouble sleeping. I hear voices in my mind...I am not sure where they come from. They seem to be attracted to the lute. Not evil, more like full of sadness and yearning. Sometimes they tell me things...and those things happen. I am torn...do I warn people? Or just let Fate take it's course? I don't know what to do..." her voice breaking as she tried to make sense of it.<br/><br/>Her eyes became a bit sunken as the lack of sleep took it's toll. She started losing weight and became very thin. The power of the Light never left her however. She was sustained by the hope that all would be revealed in time.

Traveling with Hani was more excitement than he could remember in quite a while. Evenings were spent playing and singing for the patrons, and the days resting and moving on to new places with new faces.<br/><br/>They practiced together, their music harmonizing almost magically. Perhaps the lute and recorder were meant to be together. Though her history of how she received the lute , and his with finding the recorder had nothing in common. <br/><br/>And while the music harmonized well, it was when they joined their voices in song, that really made an impact with the people listening. Whether they sang a love song, an old tavern ditty, or even a simple song of the road, their voices melded and created a moment of two for those listening to share and remember a past or even a place they may have been. <br/><br/>They truly did make beautiful music together. However, when the night was still, and they went to separate rooms, his heart reached out to her as he heard her cries of startlement and fear...sometimes worse.<br/><br/>He made potions and elixers to build her strength, and fortify her. And one night, as she tossed and turned, and groaned loudly in her bed. He reached out to her, and held her close. And she relaxed and found peace within his arms. And she slept with him holding her until the rising of a new day.<br/><br/>Az listened and consoled Hani as she talked to him of the voices, and the nightmares. And while he had no experience with such a thing, he promised he would help her as much as he could. Light he wanted to aid her, wanted to her to come to some sort of balance with these forces that provoked and mystified her, and whispered to her in the night.<br/><br/>And they began to share a bed. Somehow having Azmos there holding her helped her cope with the voices and nightmares. Not that all nights were peaceful, however he was there to wipe her brow, whisper to her calm her, and hold her close and try to give her some sort of peace and security. <br/><br/>And he found himself slowly beginning to care and love her more and more as time went by.

The nights were the worst for Hahnai, nightmares stalked her with unrelenting horror. If she did not find an answer soon, she would surely go insane. She wondered if the last one to hold this lute felt the same? Had they found a way to curb the voices? To quell the darkness.<br/><br/>Guilt piled on insecurity and she struggled to keep her mind clear. It was only when she sang with Azmos that the voices lessened. The harmony and joy she felt from him soothed her. The darkness receded when he held her in his arms. She relied on him more and more as the days passed. The nights spent sleeping with his arms around her the only respite she could find. Her heart went out to him like a moth to a flame, the Light shining from him coaxed her into the peace she desperately craved.<br/><br/>They found a sort of peace in Shattrath, after speaking to A'Dal. The Naaru gave his blessing to them and she was relieved of some of the burdens. A'Dal showed her how to screen the voices out, to see the reasons they cried and pleaded with her. Hahnai noted that Azmos seemed more at ease after their visit to the Naaru as well. As if he was even more in tune with the glory of the Light.<br/><br/>When they returned to Azeroth she found she could relax more when she was around others. Her singing never stopped, her love for Azmos grew day by day. She began to feel better and stronger. Her confidence soared with each new day and the joy she felt when she sang with him was almost overwhelming.<br/><br/>The nights were peaceful, but Hahnai wanted more from Azmos. Somehow she felt he was holding back. She did not know why he did. Up until that night she kissed him, they had only shared a bed in a platonic way. He never asked for more from her, and she did not want to push him to make him feel uncomfortable.<br/><br/>But that changed when she leaned to kiss him goodnight instead of the peck on the cheek. Her lips lingered on his in a sweet surrender she hoped would encourage him to do more. Her soft hands caressed his cheek and smoothed his long white hair. "Azmos...do you...want me?" she whispered to him, half afraid of his response. She did not want to offend him, she only wanted to give him more of the love she felt pounding in her heart.

His mind went back to his entry into the church, and how strong the sense of the Light was there. His own strength with using the Light had been one that surprised the scholars and faculty. And he learned of the Light, and the Shadow, and he made a personal vow at that time he would remain celibate and only use the Holy Light as it was given him. To stay strong in the Light and have no distractions of the flesh or Shadow. <br/><br/>He remembered the long afternoon discussion with his friend Cyaer, and how every Sindorei male was necessary to rebuild and repopulate the race after the devastation of the Scourge. And he had held onto his belief that by staying the way he was, the Light was stronger within him. <br/><br/>Then he had come to the shore of a new nation, Pandaria. He had found that books, and such notions were not always the way to find answers. And his heart was opened by a young pandaren innkeeper...emotions and all their touchy feely elements were exposed within him. He had been so stoic, and emotionless, now he was a changed man...<br/><br/>Then he heard the song of a teal-eyed songbird in a tavern that captured his attention and his heart. Her voice pulled him in, and he came to stay with her trying to aid her in her pain and anguish. Holding her in his arms, and giving her solace there.<br/><br/><strong><em>"Azmos...do you...want me?"</em></strong> How could he explain himself? How he had never experienced the deep desires and passions within himself like he did, until he met her. That yes, he wanted her...yet he did not know how. That he was a virgin even at his age and centuries of life.<br/><br/>His voice was deep and warm, as well as hesitant, as he spoke to the loveliest creature he had ever seen looked at him. "Hahnai...I...I have never been with a woman before....I want to, with you...I just don't know how?" His deep eyes fell to his hands that lay in his lap, and he closed them, fearing reproach...fearing anything...while his heart pounded so loud in his chest, he was sure she could hear it beating.

His words hit a chord in her she was certain he could hear. "Azmos, there are many things in life that are taken for granted. The body knows what it wants, the mind reacts with doubts and fears, or determination and courage. I have known a few in my life who refused to listen to their hearts and ended up lonely and sad. The body leads with instinct, the mind with stimulus of the higher kind like shared interests and common goals. But the heart is the ruler, it gives you inspiration and yearning." her hands caressed his cheek. She had to lean in to kiss him again, the yearning and need she felt did not need words.<br/><br/>Without more than a simple smile she led him to the bed they had been sharing as simple friends keeping each other warm. He had brought peace to her dreams simply by being there beside her. He had held her in his arms as a father would a frightened child. Over the months she had come to truly love him. But would he break his vows for her? Was she too thin and frail for him to even want her? She wanted to love him, wanted to taste his desire and need. <br/><br/>This night was only the first of many. She found him a willing lover with a gentleness she adored, yet a passion that made her giddy with desire. Her surprise at the amount of hair on his body was short lived. He was self concious about it, but she adored him all the more, calling him her teddy bear. <br/><br/>That night she slept sounder than she ever had, wrapped in his arms and covered with a sheet. He sheltered her, loved her and made her life complete. How could she ever ask for more?
