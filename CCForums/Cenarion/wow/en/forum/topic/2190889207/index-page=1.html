NAME(S): Red Earth of the Blackhide, Matriarch of the Ishnu Por Ah; AKA Meshkwahki in her tribal dialect<br/><br/>FAMILY HISTORY:Swifthorn tribe, family Blackhide. Eldest daughter of Dark Sky (father, now deceased), shaman and clan elder, and White Hoof (mother), hunter. One sibling, a younger sister, Kick Feather.<br/><br/>ACTIVITY BRIEF:Appearing in Mulgore not long after Thunder Bluff was established, this Tauren travelled alone until becoming involved with a social occasion in Ashenvale hosted by a Kal’dorei named Aroree. Started out as an open invitation walk no matter the faction, the event became seen as an effort for peace as both Aroree and Red Earth rose to become its figureheads, refusing to fight against any who would attempt to harm them during these nightly walks. Growing friction between the two factions resulting in open warfare in Ashenvale, as well as assassination attempts on them, and a growing difference of opinion about the Walks objectives caused a split which eventually led to its demise after four months.<br/><br/>During this time, she became acquainted with the Ishnu Por Ah (IPA) through an intimate relationship with a founding member, a Tauren warrior, Getharn. Involved in a few of IPA's early activities and courted to join them a few times, she refused until sometime after the death of her father. She moved up in prominence within IPA, gaining shared leadership with Feren Longstrider, its founder. When personal reasons force him to step down, she became its sole leader. Presently, she is still leader.<br/><br/>Though the reasons for Feren’s removal are mysterious and tragic, there seems to be no foul play involved in the takeover. The current whereabouts of Getharn are unknown. He is presumed dead, lost at Blackrock Mountain. There has been no further love interest, though she is fanatically pursued by an eccentric Forsaken, Abominus.<br/><br/>As a member she continued to call for peace. However, under her leadership, IPA also became a more Tauren focused group, as she advocates the Will of the Earthmother and the preservation and sovereignty of the Tauren nation. These sentiments are not surprising. She does not consider herself a member of the Horde. This stems from the beliefs of her home tribe who have refused to ally themselves with the Horde for fear of losing their Tauren cultural identity. The tribe's majority remain nomadic, separate from Horde society. Red Earth is known to visit them at least once or twice a year.<br/><br/>As a shaman, she is considered a special circumstance. Tribe tradition dictates that those in the Blackhide family born with pure black fur are meant to be the Swifthorn shaman. Red Earth, whose fur is red, discovered the call of the Spirits howver and learned from her father. She lives apart from her tribe as they believe her differences determine she was not to live among them. It is believed that this separation has made her faith in the Earthmother’s guidance and her reliance on visions paramount to her actions and teachings.<br/><br/>Visions overwhelmed her in her early years. But after spending time in the Outlands with the Mag’har of Nagrand, she seems to have a better control of their effects on her. It is also in her years in the Outlands that this “simple shaman” rose to become a leader of war parties. It is believed that this development and the following participation in the battles in Northrend are the seed for the more militant attitude that is developing in concerns to the protection of Mulgore and her drive to bring prominence back to the IPA which has weakened in the aftermath of Lich King’s defeat and the eruption of the Cataclysm.<br/><br/>Her strong belief in the Earthmother causes her to despise Fel magic. Her belief that all people are Children of the Earthmother compel her to attempt to treat all with compassion and fairness. This is juxtaposed with her traditional upbringing which makes her biased towards the Tauren people before any other people or nation, Horde or otherwise.<br/><br/>THREAT ASSESSMENT: The impact of her activities have had their effect, though nothing long lasting. But she is able to build strong ties which has garnered respected friends from both factions, has allowed her to absorb different members from now defunct groups such as the Horntotem Tribe and the Mt. Hyjal Alliance, and retain relationships with former members of the IPA like ranking members of the suspiciously entrepreneurial Razortalons. Also with her independent stance, a growing militant attitude and past accounts of erratic behavior based on her calling, the seeds are there for something to occur. She should continue to be watched.

NAME(S): Arothand "Aro" Lightsworn, previously Executor of the Razortalons, previously Guardian of the Household Zharikov.<br/><br/>FAMILY HISTORY: Most of not all of the Lightsworn family appears to be deceased. Parents confirmed deceased, possible unconfirmed sightings of siblings within the past year. Present status unknown.<br/><br/>ACTIVITY BRIEF: Lightsworn's activity hasn't been difficult to trace. Heavily involved in the Silvermoon army when he came of age around a hundred years ago, he excelled in most forms of armed and unarmed combat, but was shown to be a poor leader when given the opportunity. <br/><br/>Eventually, apparently fed up with the politics of Silvermoon, the Elf went rogue, pirating a ship and crew. Remained a minor threat, moreso of a nuisance for quite some time. Eventually, driven by remorse, he took up the path of the Paladin. Activity between then and now is fairly typical for an Elf his age, a veteran of several wars. <br/><br/>When his people defected, so too did Arothand, joining the Blood Knights in their feeding off of the Naaru M'uru. Eventually, however, it appears he grew sick of politics once more, taking his leave of Silvermoon once more.<br/><br/> He made quick friends with the Archmagus, Raoul Zharikov, and joined the ranks of Da Doctas as a "Protecta". His time with the Doctas was relatively short, ended by a dispute over a demon-possessed woman, and the treatment of those who reside on the campus. Enraged, Arothand enlisted in the military once more, killed in action, and raised as a Knight of the Ebon Blade.<br/><br/>It was at this point Arothand began to delve into more suspicious territory. Furthering his friendship with Archmagus Zharikov, he gave an oath to the man that he would protect Raoul and his family. At this point, Arothand picked up what appears to be a dangerous romantic relationship with possible cultist Sizer Williamson, the self-proclaimed "Titansteel Warrior", the three becoming an organization of sorts, their fingers dug into a few events including a form of magic rabies that plagued Da Doctas campus.<br/><br/>Eventually, whether by contract or otherwise, Zharikov entered the service of the once-again suspicious business organization known as the Razortalons. Arothand was quick to follow. Hardly business savvy, and not the type to take on a leadership position, Arothand appeared to be some sort of high-ranking Bruiser/bodyguard, calling himself an "Executor". His work with the Talons has been particularly hard to track, however it can be deduced that he is a muscle of some sort, and appears to do a good job of keeping mouths shut.<br/><br/>This took an odd turn, however, when due to a dispute in beliefs, or possibly honor, Arothand betrayed the Talons, killing an estimated four-five of their rank, and himself, in the process. For unknown reasons he has been resurrected by the Razortalons, and has resumed his work for them, as well as reuniting with his presumed love interest, Sizer.<br/><br/>THREAT ASSESSMENT: Arothand has proven himself capable of taking down large groups of enemies, and friends alike, having recently killed a substantial amount of Razortalons in one fight. The means of such are unknown. His kill count beyond that is suspected to be much higher, however, many of the deaths he has been involved with have quickly been covered up by unseen forces. He has connections within the ranks of the Razortalons, and appears to be close to the leader of Da Doctas, Sidonwy. Often seen carrying Old God artifacts, his loyalty to the Horde is questionable due to his close relationship with a possible cultist. While his skills as a soldier are unquestionable, he appears to make rash decisions, and is likely temperamental. While this makes him less likely to lead an organized assault, he is unpredictable. He should be watched.

NAME(S): Malulji<br/><br/>FAMILY HISTORY: Wife(Bia'jai, Priestess) deceased. Daughter(Zura, Headhunter) deceased. Son(Kali) deceased. Parents(Unknown), Presumed deceased.<br/><br/>ACTIVITY BRIEF: Pre-Horde activity appears to have been entirely within the confines of the Stranglethorn Vale. Details mostly unknown prior to the deaths of his family, during the aftermath of which the Troll displayed a penchant for voodoo practice, sacrificing the entire raiding party, as well as approximately another dozen Gurubashi Trolls of varying ages.<br/><br/>Intervening years saw the Troll wander somewhat, contracting work across the Southern Eastern Kingdoms.<br/><br/>Horde-contact after the Third War resulted in the Troll taking work as available from Horde members of varying races. A chance poster regarding a Troll Summer Festival being hosted by, then Head of Da Doctas, Hrookhzin, resulted in sponsorship as contender in Festival Fight Tournament. After the Festival, the Troll continued employment as a non-medical member of Da Doctas school.<br/><br/>The school's mandate was expanded by the Head Docta to encompass all important skills, previously specializing in Medical Practice. As a result of the expansion, the Troll was offered a permanent position on the staff of Da Doctas to aid in the transition. A position he nominally retains to this day, despite a great deal of younger, capable staff members to take over.<br/><br/>Recent years has seen the Troll return to his previous voodoo practices, proving proficient in multiple types of rituals. While he keeps it mostly private, his habits have increasingly taken to it's use to supplement his aging body.<br/><br/>THREAT ASSESSMENT: Despite being of advanced age, the Troll remains in significant physical condition, further supplemented by voodoo rites and blessings. In addition to himself, he retains the companionship of a number of animals, all of whom have shown to be fiercely loyal to the Troll, and fully capable of operating completely independant of the Troll's direct influence. His vicious response to the deaths of his family, and complete willingness to practice voodoo arts are both notable. Should continue to be observed with great care.

NAME(S): Kick Feather of the Blackhide; Full name-Kicks the Feather Walking<br/><br/>FAMILY HISTORY:Swifthorn tribe, family Blackhide. Youngest daughter of Dark Sky (father, now deceased), shaman and clan elder, and White Hoof (mother), hunter. One sibling, an elder sister, Red Earth<br/><br/>ACTIVITY BRIEF:<br/>Kickfeather left her tribe in pursuit of her sister, Red Earth, of whom she has shown to be very protective. Her concerns were not unfounded as after a few months of search she found herself helping her sister’s then lover, Getharn, rescue her from the quillboar who had captured her while she was in a state of visionary delusion. It was also with a troll witch doctor’s aid-Hrookzhin, then leader of Da Doctas-that Kickfeather was able to be reunited with her sister. Because of this, she joined Da Doctas to help pay off the debt she owed to Dr. Hrookzhin for helping her save her sister’s life. <br/><br/>As a Protector, she stayed happily with Da Doctas for several months. Then a dispute between Hrookzhin’s daughter, Arjah, and Kickfeather arose. The dispute stemmed from Arjah’s accusations that Red Earth hated and tried to kill the troll, something Red Earth flatly denied. Kickfeather sided with her sister and challenged Arjah for spreading such “dishonorable” rumors. When Hrookzhin would not help resolve the issue, Kickfeather then left the service of Da Doctas considering her debt paid and joined the Ishnu Por Ah, a Tauren focused group which her sister now led.<br/><br/>Kickfeather is a young, strong warrior. After joining the Ishnu Por Ah, she resumed the protective role of her sister. This spread to any of the Ishnu Por Ah whom she considers a second family. She has been known to offer to “take care of” and “beat up” any who threatened any member of IPA in anyway. As far as we know, she has never had to carry out such threats. She also aided the Horde in their struggle to maintain their borders and protect their resources and so was seen frequenting battles at Warsong Gulch, Alterac Valley and Arathi. When many went to the Outlands after the Dark Portal reopened, Kickfeather stayed behind to continue to protect the home front. Though never a true member of the Horde forces, she was given the honorary recognition of Sergeant for her actions on the battlefields. When the Lich King arose to attack the nations of Azeroth, Kickfeather joined the multitude of armies and headed to Northrend.<br/><br/>She is known to have a very wild nature, acting before thinking. Some have called her crazy. She has shown to have an extreme curiosity, quite naïve about things outside her tribal education, though her years spent in the Horde lands has taught her much. She is never shy, her nature is certainly brash and she shows no fear in battle. But she seems to have a strong sense of honor and a deep respect for her faith and those she calls family, especially her sister whose words she lives by. This has helped temper any extreme actions she may have or will take.<br/><br/>THREAT ASSESSMENT : Though sharing the faith of her sister in the Earthmother, it is not as fanatical. And though she is a berserker in battle, there is no record of her being a danger to any she does not consider the enemy. Alone she is not a threat. She is, however, deeply loyal to her sister and many of her actions stem from what her sister advises. And so may be considered a deadly instrument, a ‘right-hand man', in whatever machinations her sister may devise.

NAME(S): Ehlina Anna Vargas<br/><br/>FAMILY HISTORY: Father Grazer Vargas ( Presumed deceased). Mother Anna Vargas (Presumed Deceased). Sister Kathina Vargas (formerly deceased, formally forsaken, currently very deceased) Padimate Gizmoshock Vargas ( Adopted Daughter. Aliveish )<br/><br/>ACTIVITY BRIEF:<br/><br/>Vargas originally hailed from Lordearon. She and her family were there when the Arthas returned from his venture to Northrend. The parents stayed to defend Lordearon from the scourge while Ehlina was tasked with getting her younger sister safely out of Lordearon.<br/><br/>Ehlina failed to get her sister of out Lordearon alive. It was in fact the younger Vargas that saved Ehlina's life as the scourge approached. Kathia was killed in the process. Details unclear.<br/><br/>Ehlina swore vengeance and moved south to train at Northshire Abby. Shortly after completing her training she joined the militant holy order Sisters of Mercy eventually becoming it's leader.<br/><br/>Originally Vargas held to the original Sisterhood mandate of defensive only for the first year of her leadership tenure she began to become more proactive in her combat duties causing a rift within the Sisterhoods more traditional members. Eventually she left the order and founded group called Path of War.<br/><br/>Path of War's goal was the removal of all threats the Alliance by any means necessary. Multiple assaults into Horde strong holds in Northrend as well as assisted in an simultaneous Alliance assault against all Horde towns in Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms. Psyche evaluations point toward Vargas becoming more and more prone to outbursts of rage during this time period which eventually lead into a suicidal charge into Lordearon.<br/><br/>She was thought to have been killed and there was no activity from her a period of almost a half a year.<br/><br/>Literally one day out of the blue she showed up in Stormwind. Seemingly less prone to anger and having taken the vows of Paladinhood. She took up the command of Path of War once again but changes it's name to Pillar of Honor to reflect a less hostile stance with the world. <br/><br/>THREAT ASSESSMENT: Poor to very dangerous. On her own Vargas is only an slightly better than average combatant that can be easily defeated with one or more opponents. However Vargas excels in her ability to rally numerous members of the Alliance to a cause or action. She fully believes in the righteousness of the causes she champions to almost a zealot level. Recent Alliance counter offensives in Ashenvale and Silverpine forest point to this.

NAME(S): Tidestalker Wavehoof<br/><br/>FAMILY HISTORY: entire clan presumed deceased<br/><br/>ACTIVITY BRIEF:<br/>The Wavehoof clan was a unique clan of Tauren that spent almost the entirety of it's time at see. Port records retrieved by Steamwheedle agents show occasional visits for trade and purchases of cloth. All records cease approximately 15 years ago.<br/><br/>An individual calling himself Tidestalker began moving around various ports at approximately that same point, rising in rank among various ships, both merchant and pirate, until he eventually became captain of his own vessel, at which point Tidestalker became fully committed to a life of piracy. Among pirates, his infamy continued to rise, until eventually several pirate groups came together under his leadership. Rumors persist that he is known as the King of Pirates, however we haven't been able to find a reliable source willing to admit that the title is his.<br/><br/>What can be confirmed is that he has been associated with several Horde groups, including being identified as a member of Ishnu Por Ah for a brief time. It is rumored that his departure from the guild was a result of the disappearance of it's leader at that time, Feren. He has also been in alliance with several other Horde groups in assaults on various strategic locations, outside of his normal piracy. In addition he has served among the Frostwolves of Alterac Valley, making a point of killing any dwarf he could see. Rumors at that time mention a throne made from dwarf spines collected in battle, however possession of such an item cannot be confirmed.<br/><br/>Currently he has been spotted assisting various groups (see: Earthen Ring as an example) deal with threats resulting from the Cataclysm.<br/><br/>THREAT ASSESSMENT:<br/><br/>Unable to quantify current risk, as many of his past actions and associations cannot be substantiated beyond rumors. Despite rumors about being the King of Pirates, Tidestalker has not demonstrated any active leadership among the Pirates, nor has he made any active assaults on Horde or Alliance merchants in recent months. Threat may be negligible, as Tidestalker appears to spend much of his time drinking and carousing in the location known as Booty Bay.

PRE-DEATH ACTIVITY BRIEF<br/>(Note: The following was compiled from multiple local sources and is presented here as a foundation to possibly explain future activities.) Born in Pyrewood Village before the Scourge overtook the area, Vincent was raised primarily by his mother while his father ran a small mercantile fleet. Vincent was found to be a quick book learner (especially in the arcane and medical sciences) but lacked the social ethic to be a productive member of the community. Conversely, his brother Isaac became a civil engineer, helping to maintain the buildings and various utilities. Several years later, Isaac discovered that his brother had joined a local cabal of warlocks to further his learning. During the Scourge outbreak, Vincent had fallen ill and was bedridden. Isaac took this opportunity to suffocate Vincent with a pillow, to remove the "corruption" his brother represented. For reasons that have yet to be identified, the suffocation and subsequent death served as a catalyst for the Scourge plague. <br/><br/>POST-UNDEATH ACTIVITY BRIEF: Several weeks later, Vincent became re-animated by the Scourge plague, but retained some degree of free will. Returning to Pyrewood, he learned that his Last Will and Testament was found but was not carried out. While Vincent was dead, his cultist activities were brought to the Mayor's attention. The Mayor chose to not honor the Will and instead distributed the inheritance to repair the damages he felt the Cult caused. It is unclear if Isaac's position as Chief Engineer held any influence in this series of events, especially since preparing for the inevitable reprisals of a demon-worshipping enclave normally does not require the addition of a patio and gazebo on The Mayor's summer home. <br/><br/>Vincent somehow learned of this, and began to "collect what he is owed", by killing each person that he felt would have his inheritance. Upon reaching his home, he found his wife Claudia and children waiting for him. Instead of defending themselves, they were ready to sacrifice themselves, since they thought at the time it was the arrival of their demonic lord. Instead, Vincent asked how much of the inheritance they got. After they responded that they were given the house but none of the money, Vincent told Claudia she would now inherit a thirty minute headstart and suggested she use it wisely. He left the house and tracked down the Mayor and Isaac. After a series of heated arguments, they both fought Vincent but eventually lost after a protracted battle. When Vincent returned his house, he found Claudia and the children gone, but found all of his possessions intact. He would jokingly refer to this as "the cheapest divorce ever". It is rumored that they contacted one her father-in-law's old merchant friends to seek passage on a ship, but it is unclear what happened with Vincent's family since then.<br/><br/><br/>

(So one post made it, but not the other. /rage )<br/><br/>NAME(S): Doctor Vincent Hagan Wolfe, W.M.D.<br/><br/>FAMILY HISTORY: Alastair Wolfe (father, deceased), Nicole Wolfe (mother, deceased), Isaac Wolfe (brother, deceased), Claudia Wolfe ("widow", whereabouts unknown), Cheryl Wolfe (daughter, whereabouts unknown), Alessa Wolfe (daughter, whereabouts unknown)<br/><br/>ACTIVITY BRIEF: <br/><br/>THREAT ASSESSMENT: He is a wild card in any operation involving the control or elimination of the Modas il Toralar. Past attempts have resulted in massive collateral damage and high casualty rates (both to our forces and his). His mood swings, combined with engineering prowess and alchemical experiments, will make any future frontal assaults a waste of our resources. This report advises subterfuge or social discreditation; however, his guild affiliation already carries a high degree of infamy. One of our spies overheard this exchange between two guild underlings that best describes him:<br/><br/>A: "How can The Doctor (Vincent Wolfe) still be here after that hallway imploded? We lost five men and it will take weeks to repair!"<br/>B: "Remember the words of our Headmaster (Aziel V'Ghera): "He is a great liability to the Order, but is a greater liability to NOT have in the Order"."

NAME(S): Nishk M(?) Winterspear<br/><br/>FAMILY: Marital partner: Ebonbreeze of the Grimtotem. Half-Sister: Nattish Winterspear. All other family assumed deceased.<br/><br/>ACTIVITY BRIEF: Prior to his appearance in Booty Bay criminal records, there's no recorded history of Nishk Winterspear. According to his own stories, he appears to have lived as a stray until boats began traveling between Kalimdor and the Eastern kingdoms. From there, it appears he began a career as a smuggler moving illegal weapons and wares throughout the jungles of Stranglethron Vale. Records indicate the group he worked with were destroyed shortly after Ratchets completion , and it's assumed it is at this time the tauren returned to his homeland.<br/><br/>From here he appears to have gone to Mulgore to find work in the newly settled Thunder Bluff. He seems to have attempted several times to begin a career as a shaman or druid, but showed absolutely no skill in the manipulation of natural spirits. He had no magic in his blood, and showed very little promise in hand to hand combat. As a last resort, he turned to the hunters of the various tribes for training in the way of long ranged weaponry. The other aspects of the skill set appear to have been lost on him, as marksmanship was the only thing he excelled at. Beast handling and survival techniques didn't register until a later day.<br/><br/>From there, he began his career as a self proclaimed "adventurer". Unimpressive is the first word to come to mind for this period in his life. He showed little promise or skill prior to the Opening of the Dark Portal. It was during this time he began to affiliate himself with the group known as Ishnu Por Ah and the Wardens of Ysera. It appears neither of the relationships he developed with these groups were very deep early on, however he does appear to have taken a liking to the huntress known as Malsa Grimtotem. &lt;There's a note here: "Possible obsession with Grimtotem women as love interests, possibly a means of dealing with his parents demise at the hands of Grimtotem raiding party?"><br/><br/>During the Burning Crusade, he was accepted into the Ishnu Por Ah, joining regularly with their "War Parties" that dealt with various non-Horde/Alliance affiliated threats. It was also during this time he began a relationship with a one Benna Ragetotem. It appears the relationship was a strained one that began with Benna leaving her family to be with the hunter. It ended after both individuals went missing at separate times, resulting in a canceled engagement and a miscarriage of their unborn child. Further falling out occurred when Nishk found a new partner years later.<br/><br/>It appears that during this time he also began open hostility with an elf warlock. It's not certain if he held a resentment to all elves (who were at the time a new addition to the Horde), but it is known that he held unique hatred for this one in particular as he and what can possibly be considered his cult after they kidnapped a close friend of his. Several attempts to take the elfs life and vice versa appear to have ended in a fizzle as the elf just seemed to fall off the face of Azeroth.<br/><br/>During the Campaign in Northrend, Nishk was confirmed to begin unique training with various groups in the ways of the hunter. This includes Darkspear Shadowhunters, Forsaken Dark Rangers, and Orc survivalists. It seems he was suffering from issues of self worth after his fiance Benna Ragetotem and he ended their relationship. These issues of self debt eventually turned into self-destructive habbits including consumption of illegal substances and all-night festivities in his Dalaran apartment. It was when the Trial of Champions started calling for competitors did he return to the adventurer scene. Here he was given the chance to use the skills he learned and developed while training, excelling in the art of skill-shooting. From here, he was allowed to join the Argent Crusade (along with his war party from Ishnu Por Ah) in the final push into Icecrown Citadel. During this time, he began courting the druid Ebonbreeze, who was at the time an initiate of the group. It appears from here the relationship grew stronger over time as the two married briefly before the Elemental Invasion.<br/><br/>During the elemental invasion, he was confirmed to be an enthusiastic defender of both Thunder Bluff and Orgrimmar, even during the later days of the attacks where defenders where far and few. He also appears to have been involved in the reclamation of Thunder Bluff after the Grimtotem revolt plotted by Elder Crone Magatha. From this point to the Cataclysm, he was involved with assisting in cleaning up the city.<br/>

After the Cataclysm, his fury seemed to be focused on the invading forces of the Alliance in Southern Kalimdor. After several attacks on the establishing groups in the region, he joined with one of the first groups of soldiers moving to take Tol'barad, followed by Stormwind. The plan was interrupted by a kraken, however, and it seems after a long journey through the Twilight Highland, the hunters bloodlust was either sated or simply lost.<br/>He's currently in a state of inactivity, focusing on his private life over the dealings of the greater forces of Azeroth.<br/><br/>THREAT ASSESSMENT: Dangerous.<br/>Nishk may have began his career as nothing more then an average thug, it's obvious his skills have grown much since then. His natural tauren size and strength allows him to wield long ranged weapons that would otherwise have to be mounted to be used. This combined with his accuracy at long ranges make him an especially deadly factor. It appears in close ranged combat, he's been known to use self-enhancing substances to allow him to push himself past normal limits to escape his assailants or in other cases, he's actually overwhelmed opponents with his natural weapons (Horns, Hooves, Teeth) who assumed that he was helpless in hand to hand combat. <br/>Given his current inactivity, he's much less dangerous then during his work in the Citadel, but is still a force to be reckoned with. Continued observation suggested.<br/>

NAME: Benna Ragetotem (21) (also sub folders for sisters Ninah (17) and Lilianah "Lily" Ragetotem (15) )<br/><br/>FAMILY: <br/>Parents: Ker &amp; Sark (TB)<br/>Siblings: Dern (Elder Brother) &amp; Ashra of the Frosthoof tribe, there is offspring of less than a year. (Nagrand)<br/>Cousins: Altsoba (Felwood), Etu &amp; Henen (TB) (2 children living in Nagrand), Kard &amp; Sunn (TB) (1 child living in Nagrand), Torm (TB) (Wife and young child in Nagrand). <br/>A grand mother and an elderly aunt can also be found in Nagrand.<br/>There are reports of Ragetotems in the Grizzly Hills, Alterac Valley, and the Blasted Lands but those are father removed. <br/><br/>ACTIVITY BRIEF (Benna): <br/>All three girls were raised in Thunder Bluff in a strict clan and household. Benna began warrior training after her 16th Birthday, but failed to make any progress in over a year. Afterward she began training as a shaman, herbalist, and alchemist, at which she made much quicker progress and soon left the Bluff to find work. <br/><br/>She appears to have met the bull Nishk Winterspear through an AAMS mail mix up at the Doctas clinic. Her romantic involvement with NW lead her to cut ties with her family over an arranged marriage. It also introduced her to the Tauren separatist organization, Ishnu Por Ah (please reference the IPA files for further explanation). During Benna's time with the IPA, there was a price on her head, and the contract was taken by Stefan Pryak. Given that Benna never showed any particular talents as a shaman, or seemed to possess anything very interesting, it is likely that the contract was due entirely to her relationship with NW. <br/><br/>It was during this time that Benna started her seed collection. It is likely that she has seeds of most plants growing Azaroth or the Outlands before the cataclysm. After saving an elfin child from a Modas Il Toralor raid and delivering the child to a foster family through the AAMS, she developed strong ties to the orphanage in the lower city of Shattrath, where she tutored and volunteered until her breakup with NW, at which point she moved in and began full time work. Before the break up, Benna resided primarily in the apartment of NW in Booty Bay and in a small house she had purchased in Nagrand. <br/><br/>Benna became pregnant and retired to the jungles of Stranglethorn with Arjah and Hrookzihn. After that her whereabouts are unknown for a period of close to a year, but it is known that the baby was lost. Her relationship with NW quickly dissolved after that period. Benna has been known to engage in long bouts of meditation and perhaps this was an example. Benna left the IPA once NW introduced the druid Ebonbreeze, leading us to believe that her interest in the group was romantic rather than political. <br/><br/>Benna followed Arjah to the Homeland, a group with no coherent ideology, of which she remains a member. She reconnected with her sister Ninah through this group and with her Brother Dern through the tournament. Shortly after reuniting with Dern, she moved out of the orphanage and into Dern and Ashra's apartment in Dalran along with Ninah. When it became clear that Azaroth was unstable, Benna returned to the Bluff to offer to take family members to her home in Nagrand. Two elderly ladies, five children, and one cousin were sent with her. In addition all members of the apartment in Dalaran moved. Benna appears to be the main breadwinner for this entire family group, and has been working almost constantly for the horde since their arrival at her home. <br/><br/>THREAT ASSESSMENT: Benna poses no physical or rhetorical threat. However, her efforts to grow exotic plants particularly the violent ones of the Underbog in non-native locations requires observation. <br/><br/>APPENDIX A: NINAH RAGETOTEM<br/><br/>Ninah dyed her fur black and ran from the Bluff shortly after a coming of age ritual at the beginning of her warrior training. She seems to have gone directly to the Undercity to begin training with the RAS. She joined the Homeland on a Welcome Walk through Brill and reconnected with Benna in short order. <br/><br/>At the beginning of the semester Ninah gained admittance to the RAS apprenticeship program and is currently studying alchemy full time. She plans to specialize in the creation of flesh golems. <br/><br/>THREAT ASSESSMENT: As a up and coming student of the RAS, Ninah should be watched with the rest of them. <br/><br/>APPENDIX B: LILIANAH "LILY" RAGETOTEM<br/><br/>Lilianah has lived in Thunder Bluff until her recent move to Nagrand. She has recently begun training as a paladin under the supervision of Benna and the Sunwalkers. Although, it seems Benna has been looking for an alternate chaperone. <br/><br/>THREAT ASSESSMENT: Unknown, although given the penchant of her sisters for dangerous experiments it seems wise to watch the youngest Ragetotem as well.

NAME: Ugo’gra “Three Eyes”; Slave name – Bertrim or Bertie<br/><br/>FAMILY: No known family<br/><br/>ACTIVITY: <br/>It is believed he is one of a number of orcs who were taken from the internment camps created by King Terenas Menethil II to serve as slaves in Human households. His status as such can be verified by a numbered tattoo on his his back right shoulder. Brought to the house of a mage by the name of Arahim, records show him listed as a house slave given the name Bertrim. Arahim was a strong supporter of King Terenas’s belief that orcs once separated from their bloodlust could become ‘rehabilitated’ and educated. And so it is believed that Bertrim may have been more than just a house slave. That he may have been part of magical experiments to purge any remaining bloodlust as well as been given some formal education. His knowledge of other languages such as Common, Dwarf and Elven dialects may be seen as proof of this. There are accounts in later years of his servitude of the orc being allowed to leave ‘freely’ from the house as a serving companion to Arahim’s only daughter, Elaine, when she travelled.<br/><br/>Bertrim’s service ended with tragedy when Elaine was found murdered one night in her home. While there is no proof of evidence, it was rumored that the murderer was Bertrim as the mage’s home was said to be magically protected from intruders and so only someone from within the house could have committed the crime. That his master had given “the green blooded savage” too much freedom and it was his daughter’s death that was the result. It is unknown whether or not Arahim believed these rumors. Bertrim, however, did not face any of his accusations. This is when he disappears from record and Arahim, in his grief, spoke no more of it and is now believed to be dead after the fall of Lordaeron.<br/><br/>It is believed that Bertrim was quietly returned to the internment camps. And it is from there that he escaped with Thrall and other orcs to Kalimdor, taking up the name Ugo’gra. It is unknown if this was his true name before enslavement, but it is the name he carries now. He was seen at the battle of Mt. Hyjal where he suffered major injuries which left him partially paralyzed on the right side of his body and making him blind in one eye.<br/><br/>After Mt. Hyjal, he once again disappears from record. It is believed he spent time as a hermit in the Ashenvale woods and does not appear in records until several years later when he was employed as a document translator and messenger for the East Silvermoon Company. He acquired this job on recommendation from a troll named Tzitzimime who was hired as a fleet medic shortly before Ugo’gra’s employment. She is believed to have been his lover.<br/><br/>Despite his infirmities, he travels frequently as his job requires him to. During his travels, he is known to frequent taverns for drink. He has also spent his personal time visiting various shaman, witch doctors and seers, to train under them, come to some understanding of his lot in life and perhaps find a cure for his physical handicaps.<br/><br/>When the Cataclysm occurred, Tzitzimime was lost at sea and presumed dead. Ugo’gra seems to have taken it very hard and in a depressive rage attempted suicide by drowning himself. The East Silvermoon Company, who is believed to value his skills as a translator, took care of his medical needs in the aftermath and have put him on an indefinite leave until he is considered well recovered. Since taking leave he has been seen frequenting Undercity and the Forsaken lands in the Eastern Kingdom, believed now to be studying the arcane lore of mages.<br/><br/>THREAT ASSESSMENT : Ugo’gra currently seems more a danger to himself than anyone else. However, this turn to seeking knowledge from the Forsaken may be a sign of a changed direction which should be monitored.<br/>

<strong>NAME: </strong><br/>Ahanu Plainswander<br/><br/><strong>FAMILY: </strong><br/>Tuura Horizonwalker <em>(Mother)</em>, Chagro Dirtmover <em>(Father)</em>, unknown - sibling <em>(location unknown)</em>, Plainsjr a.k.a 'Junior' <em>(son, acknowledged, see separate Dossier)</em>. Various other unidentified progeny as a result of uncontrollable and random parthenogenesis <em>(see 'Notes')</em>.<br/><br/><strong>ACTIVITY:</strong><br/><span class="underline">Brief: </span><br/>Plainswander has been a loner all his life, beginning when his family arrived in Mulgore with the rest of the tauren after the Great Migration, and continuing on even now into his later years. Despite that, he has been to all points of the explored cosmos, and with sometimes companions in the Grim Maw Clan, AAMS, Eternal Sorrow, Order of the Ebon Shield, and Ishnu Por Ah, fought most of the great threats to the world. He is almost supernaturally resilient, has survived everything two worlds can throw at him, and has been active longer than most other subjects detailed in this record.<br/><br/><span class="underline">Early Life: </span><br/>Plainswander (né: Ahanu) was completely average in all respects but size, mostly notable only for his lack of tragedy in a time where tragedy dogged so many. Raised by his mother and father in a small and so far unidentified settlement in Mulgore, his life was largely an uneventful series of long sun blessed days and nights spent around the cookfire telling tales, jokes, and lies around the events of the day. Contact with the greater group of Tauren society was limited to market days and the occasional visit from a roaming hunter or shaman. It was not until he was almost fully grown that Plainswander encountered his calling in the form of a druid. After nearly being slain by a marauding raptor pack, and subsequently being rescued by a fortuitously nearby druid, Plainswander found himself consumed with dreams and wanderlust. The newfound obsession grew to the point where, after his 10th week of unanswerable questions, stories, and pestering, his parents finally gave up hope and sent him to Bloodhoof to train with the other youngsters.<br/><br/>Plainswander showed strong aptitude for the way of the druid, and was soon "released into the wild" as it were, to begin his own path.<br/><br/><span class="underline">Early Adulthood: </span><br/>Plainswander spent much of his early adulthood wandering Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms with no real direction or purpose, simple absorbing as much as he could of life and the world. He attempted, for a while, to become a social creature, cultivating friends on both side of the Horde-Alliance conflict. It was during this time his ongoing contempt for the hardline partisan stances of both the horde and alliance was set. To this day he refers to himself not as a member of the Horde, but as "just a druid", holding his allegiance to the various Cenarion orders to be a higher calling than any political concern. It was during this time as well that, in partnership with a dwarf named Fil, Plainswander founded the diplomatic/mercantile company known as the AAMS (see separate dossier).<br/><br/>Also during this time, Plainswander began what was to become one of his signature hobbies, the fomenting of unrest, confusion, and outright conflict, all for his amusement. The combination of political, diplomatic, and mercantile connections with his natural tendency to bend the truth and tinker with events for amusement's sake has on more than one occasion landed others in considerable trouble. Plainswander has, however, so far evaded the consequences of his meddling.<br/><br/><br/><br/>

<span class="underline">Current Activity: </span><br/>Plainswander has receded from public life in the last few years, preferring to once again exist primarily as a loner and wanderer, combatting the enemies of the Cenarion orders wherever he finds them. Still associated with the "Ishnu Por Ah" (see separate Dossier) as a peripheral member, he can be found all across the globe. He appears to be searching for something, but no reports have as yet surfaced as to what this might be. <br/><br/><strong>THREAT ASSESSMENT : </strong><br/>Aside from his habits of stirring up trouble via non-military means, Plainswander can be safely regarded as "mostly harmless", posing no particular threat to the Alliance or Horde. And with his time taken up with battling the twilight cults on the behalf of his Cenarion allies, his archaeological pursuits, and his general dislike of greater society, it can be safely assumed that, for the present, attention can be turned to more important matters.<br/><br/>All this being said, <span class="underline">do not underestimate him</span>, despite being a loner, a mild mannered joker, and generally peaceful, Plainswander is still an Archdruid of the various Cenarion Orders, and as such possesses considerable personal power. In addition, his current lack of social activity has in no way diminished his prodigious web of contacts, alliances, and resources. Continued observation is required, and it would be in the interests of the of The Company to ensure that he remains blissfully distracted. Should something truly engage his interest and activity, the results could be unpredictably troublesome.<br/><br/>NOTES:<br/>Plainswander is known to consume and sometimes 'share-without-warning' mushrooms previously thought to be solely found in the Zangarmarsh region of Draenor. The effects of these fungal blooms are as yet largely unstudied, but can include hallucinations, mood swings, and irrational decision making habits.<br/><br/>Despite being an unquestionably male tauren druid, in his Moonkin form Plainswander is known to lay eggs, which he will sometimes secrete in the bags of unwary companions. Said eggs are, against all biological sense, sometimes fertile, and if left unattended in warm places can, <span class="underline">and have</span>, hatched. The resulting offspring are most likely to be tauren druids, but as Plainswander's biology is at this time largely unknown, result may vary widely. It should also be noted, as a corollary to this, when observing this particular druid, never ever accept a "mushroom omelette" from him. <span class="underline"><strong>Ever</strong></span>.

<strong>Name (life):</strong> Donald Oliver Mund<br/><strong>Name (death):</strong> Dolmund<br/><br/><strong>Age (life):</strong> Mid 40s<br/><strong>Age (death):</strong> six months<br/><br/><strong>Activity Brief:</strong><br/>Donald Mund's life until the time of his death was that of an accomplished, but otherwise completely unremarkable scholar and writer of fiction. Content to make his living writing stories, illuminating maps, and serving as a clerk and minor historian in the areas near Pyrewood Village / Ambermill, Donald was no trouble to anyone, and possessed of a quiet, nearly normal, and mostly happy life.<br/><br/>It is not known whose forces, horde or alliance, extinguished him, or what their cause was. We can only wonder as the event itself was not recorded, not even by Donald himself. What is known is that shortly after his demise, Donald was resurrected by the Valk'yr now serving under Sylvannas Windrunner, and inducted into The Forsaken. Armed now with only a pair of knives and his obsession with revenge, he has taken up a career as a rogue, and while his skills were rudimentary <em>(at best)</em> when he began, he is swiftly learning the tricks of the trade, and displaying an almost unnerving aptitude for the language of blood and urder.<br/><br/>Observation of the subject has led us to conclude that regardless of who perpetrated the murder of this man, the deed itself was one of exceptional violence. Owing to the nature of his mortal injuries, Donald is lacking certain properties common to most forsaken. Most notable of which is a large portion of his skull, and the brain matter within it, which seem to be missing. Most of Dolmund's <em>(as he prefers to be called)</em> higher faculties have been left intact, what seems most affected are the centers for language use and recognition, emotional control, and empathic perception.<br/><br/>The subject, once a even tempered polyglot with a wide range of knowledge and a passionate love of literature has been reduced to a mostly illiterate monster with only the most basic grasp of spoken common, furious psychological storms, and full knowledge of what, exactly, he's lost. The result is an unstable, and extremely angry forsaken who is, as most of them are, hell bent on what his damaged mind perceives as 'justice'. Couple this with a lack of self control, and an almost complete excision of moral restraint, and you have a cause for concern.<br/><br/><strong>Threat Assessment:</strong><br/>At present, Dolmund is extremely dangerous to those in his immediate vicinity, beyond that he can be safely disregarded. Dolmund seems to be primarily obsessed with finding who killed him, and is embarking on a search, using whatever means he may, to determine the identity of his killers. At present, owing to the missing portions of his brain, the unfortunate side effects the trauma that accompanied his first death, Domund's search is proving largely fruitless.<br/><br/>It should be noted that as a result of his resurrection, he possess the almost singleminded focus on his goal common to all forsaken, and should the parties he seeks be of sufficient importance, his crusade to find/destroy them could have lasting repercussions. Observation and possibly containment are warranted.

NAME : Mishkwaki<br/>FAMILY : No known family<br/>ACTIVITY BRIEF :<br/>Currently, this very old Tauren carries the title of Keeper for the Ishnu Por Ah and manages the communal holdings of the group as well as maintains their lodge on Spirit Rise in Thunder Bluff. He received this position from Ishnu Por Ah’s Matriarch, Red Earth of the Blackhide, who he has dedicated a life of servitude to, even assuming a variation of her Tauren name, most likely a symbol of how strong his life is bonded to hers. Before coming into Red Earth’s service, he served her father Dark Sky of the Blackhide, and so it is assumed that Red Earth inherited the contract of his service after her father’s death.<br/><br/>A generally peaceful demeanor in his old age, he has taken to studying druidism and healing and can be found spending much of his time communing with the animal spirits, particularly the birds. He has also spent his time to become a patient and skilled blacksmith and tinkerer, excelling in the crafting of various forms of weaponry. Spending most of his time on Thunder Bluff, he is occasionally seen taking the zeppelin to visit Orgrimmar on business. His role as Keeper has allowed him to develop a number of trade connections and it is believed that he has also developed a small underground business selling his own specially crafted weapons and explosives.<br/><br/>Research has revealed that for many years this Tauren was a gladiator slave to the Amani trolls in Zul’Aman, surviving by providing murderous entertainment to his brutal masters. Sold to them by his own father in an attempt to gain funds and favor to abet the suffering of his dying tribe, it is the last known act of his father and what was left of that tribe. There are no other records of their activities and it is presumed that Mishkwaki is now the last of his tribe.<br/><br/>Mishwaki’s enslavement ended some forty years later. In an unprecedented deal, the reasons how it came to pass are still unknown, Dark Sky of the Blackhide entered Zul’aman and challenged Mishkwaki to a duel, making the Amani promise to release them both if he won and letting them leave their kingdom unharmed. Dark Sky won the duel and so won Mishkwaki’s freedom and he returned with the shaman to his tribe, the Swifthorn, in Kalimdor. It is believed that because Mishkwaki knew nothing but slavery for most of his life, he offered to serve the Blackhide family for the rest of it since he knew nothing else and to repay them for his ‘freedom’. After many years, he did eventually leave their service to live the life of an ascetic and it is during this time the it is believed he heard his calling to take up the hand of healing and druidism. But he then joined Red Earth on Thunder Bluff a year after the death of her father and resumed his service.<br/><br/>Though the Tauren puts forward a bit of an eccentric and peaceful façade as an old, doddery druid, there are signs that his years of slavery have left their scars and not just physical ones. He has expressed great hatred for trolls and a wariness of other races, especially blood elves, who were more than likely his most prolific victim in the gladiator ring. It is only his unwavering dedication to Red Earth who encourages a more open acceptance of other people that prevents him from acting on his aggressions.<br/><br/>THREAT ASSESSMENT : The danger of Mishkwaki is directly related to whatever commands Red Earth gives to him. It is said he has killed for her without a second thought, but there is no evidence beyond rumor. There is also the question of his possible activities as an underground arms dealer and this should be further assessed.<br/>

Name: Kerstin Thatcher <br/><br/>Family History: <br/>Little is known of her birth mother. Her father, Ickabod J. Felwizzle, was a warlock who apparently thought sacrificing his wife and infant daughter would help him summon a demon lord shortly after the end of the second war. He was dissuaded in this attempt by a group of Paladins who while unable to prevent her mothers death were able to save her. Her father's current whereabouts and fate are unknown. She was adopted and raised by Sir Rodger Thatcher in the outskirts of Lorderon, and after the death of her parents to the scourge managed to escape with other refugees to Stormwind when Lorderon fell.<br/><br/>Activity brief: <br/>Having been raised by a Paladin, she aspired to follow in her adopted fathers footsteps. Sadly while her combat skills were well honed, her ability to channel the light was not as strong. (in fact, she had a severe allergy to a common herb used in making of mana potions) She instead concentrated more on the martial disciplines, working for many years as a soldier for the Alliance. She disappeared shortly after the Lich King's attacks upon the south, sources say she was in Northrend on a classified mission.<br/>When next spotted months later, she had obviously died and been brought back as a Death Knight. She refuses to discuss the exact circumstances of her death, what is known is that her father had reappeared, and was possibly working for the Lich King, and may have had a hand in her transformation. It is believed that he may still be alive, as she spends a large amount of time searching for him, to as one source said 'cut off his head and turn his skull into a litter box for her cat.'<br/><br/>Threat Assement: <br/>She was a fair to average warrior, as a death knight however, she is more dangerous, but can be taken down by multiple opponents. Tenacious, she will not retreat until ordered, and even then is often the last to leave an area. She has been recruited by Pillar of Honor, and is under the command of High Guard Vargas.

Name: <br/>Emma Macnee<br/><br/>Family History. <br/>John Macnee (father, deceased) Diana Macnee (mother, deceased) <br/><br/>Activity Brief:<br/>An only child, she wanted to follow in her fathers footsteps in the Gilnean intelligence service. Due to a conflict with one of her instructors, she was assigned to the Foreign Intelligence branch, which with the Kingdom having been walled off from the rest of the world, was seen as a punitive assignment. Despite this she managed to thrive in her assignment, getting into one of the few slots for agents to pass the Greymane wall. She spent several years traveling as a simple trader, reporting back whenever possible. She was recalled upon the eruption of hostilities between Lord Crowley and the King's forces. Despite her belief that Crowley's cause was just, she sided with her King, for as she put it “I gave an oath, and if my word doesn't mean anything, then I don't mean anything” The fighting had just barely ceased when the city began to be overrun with feral worgen, it was during this time that she was infected. Since being cured she tends to prefer her worgen form, only shifting back to human when engaged in undercover investigations. While Gilneas has technically ceased to exist as nation, she still is part of Gilnean Intelligence, and is believed to continue to keep King Greymane updated with what she finds in order to prepare for the liberation of her homeland. Keeping with this goal she has allied herself with Pillar of Honor<br/><br/>Threat Assessment:<br/>Bloody dangerous! She can go instantly from coyish flirting to driving a poisoned dagger hilt deep in someones guts, as several of our agents found out the hard way. Highly trained in covert operations and assassinations, and is a skilled close quarters combatant. Engage at range if possible.<br/>
