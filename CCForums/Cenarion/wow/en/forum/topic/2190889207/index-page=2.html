<strong>NAME(S):</strong> Vasilia Starfallen AKA Vas.<br/><br/><strong>FAMILY HISTORY:</strong> Parents: Unknown. Siblings: Unknown. Previous Relations: Unknown. <br/><br/><strong>ACTIVITY BRIEF:</strong> Next to nothing is known about Vasilia's history prior to the awakening of Deathwing. She resided in the coastal town of Auberdine prior to the event and was in Darnassis when the village was destroyed. <br/><br/>Vasilia suffers from an unknown, and seemingly uncorrectable disability that affects both her short term and long term memory. As far as we can tell, she has always suffered from this disability. Learning to write at a young age greatly increased her quality of life as she was able to write things down so she would not forget them later.<br/><br/>By writing nearly everything down Vasilia is able to use her "notes" to help refresher her memory. Her ability to remember is based on numerous factors. She might be able to remember someone's name for a few days at most, but if she goes longer than that without seeing the person she will ultimately forget about the person. Her notes, both amazingly efficient and accurate help her keep her life in order. <br/><br/>Her last name was given to her by a night elf family that she stayed with after Auberdine's destruction. "Starfallen" being a literal translation of the Dreanei's ship, Exodar, falling to Azeroth from the stars.<br/><br/>Upon moving to Stormwind she has gained employment with the AAMS. Once disorganized, the AAMS has benefited greatly from her organization and attention to detail. While she has many friends she often finds the most comfort in her work and making sure the AAMS is running smoothly. Very career minded.<br/><br/>She has recently starting to form relations with another Draenei named Cyrus, who has a less than honorable past and employer. <em>&lt;See Cyrus's file for details></em><br/><br/><strong>THREAT ASSESSMENT:</strong> A capable healer, Vasilia does not pose much of a direct threat. She is known to favor the stave, wand and spells in combat and normally has a collapsible riot stick on her person at all times. While bound by the AAMS's strict neutrality policy she is often given greater access to the higher levels on both sides of the law. Of particular concern is how closely she operates with the Horde AAMS branch, often socializing with members of the Horde willingly and without provocation.

NAME(S): Chachaa Fizzlecrank<br/><br/>FAMILY HISTORY: Unknown<br/><br/>ACTIVITY BRIEF: Prior to Chachaa's "accidental discovery" of the Horde general broadcast system operated over hearthstones, nothing is known of Chachaa. According to rumors (most of which we believe were started by himself) he's been listed as a professional sapper, child actor, apprentice baker, the model for the Booty Bay statue, ordinance door-to-door salesman, or possibly a bass player. Other histories have been dis-proven, but at the moment it's impossible to tell what is the truth.<br/>Further more, it's believed prior to the Sundering, Chachaa did in fact have a bounty on his head before his trail disappeared off the Western edge of the Maelstorm. It was assumed he had been sucked in, but soon after his disappearance he began broadcasting from an unknown location. Once more, all there is to go off as to where he was is his own word. <br/><br/>He claimed to have wound up on an island shrouded in green mist with a large substructure, where he'd make daily broadcasts from, reporting his going-ons. After the Sundering, it's not certain what happened, but his first physical sighting was off the coast of the newly reconstructed Azshara in a small motorized boat roughly a month after Deathwings emergence. Since then he's somehow established a company called "Payload Incorporated" and has begun supplying the Horde with military grade munitions and trivial inventions for day to day life.<br/><br/>It appears he was recently involved (soul perpetrator) in a series of mailbox bombings through out the Horde cities and towns. It appears this isn't the only time he's caused unrest amongst his Hordsemen, having reportedly causing trouble at social events and every day activities. He's also believed to be involved [this section is blacked out]<br/><br/>THREAT ASSESSMENT: HIGHLY DANGEROUS.<br/>Regardless of what his past actually was or not, Chachaa is with no doubt a dangerous individual. An unstable mental state combined with an alarmingly fast learning rate and access to high grade explosives raises alarms in several circles. He bombed a great number of public Horde (his allies) locations on a whim, raising what he'd be capable of with a grudge. Along with his continued projects to advance his own powers through bio-enhancements and power-suits and his other inventions created with the soul purpose of destruction, Chachaa is without a doubt a target of interest.<br/>Suggested course of action: Continued close observation, possible elimination.

Name: <br/>Heiki 'Bug' Steamrunner<br/><br/>Family History: Steamrunner Cartel (defunct), Father, Gizmo Steamrunner (deceased) mother, Penelope Steamrunner (deceased) Jimbo Steamrunner (uncle, deceased)<br/> *note. Goblin cartels seem to come and go with the tides with the exception of the larger few. From what we can gather the so called 'steamrunner cartel' consisted of two brothers, his wife and child and a third hand zeppelin *<br/><br/>Activity Brief:<br/>She has spent most of the last decade in Northrend. Her father, in what he saw was a chance to finally establish his cartel, contracted as support for Prince Arthas Menethil's expedition to Northrend when she was a child. Details are sketchy, but from what we know after losing her mother and the zeppelin, her father and uncle fought for the Prince as mercenaries-only to be slaughtered by Arthas's men after the mercenary forces scuttled the fleet that was to return them to Lordaeron . She was found under a pile of bodies semi conscious by a hunting party from Icemist village who had seen the smoke and investigated after Arthas's forces left the bay. She was nursed back to health and eventually adopted by the tribe (where she acquired her nickname, being she was little and green). Over time she joined the hunting parties as she grew up, becoming very proficient with both bows and melee weapons, as well as having an unusual affinity for understanding animals. When she reached her fifteenth year two events happened that would shake her life again. Icemist village fell to the scourge, and the Horde arrived in Northrend. Traveling to Warsong hold, she was employed as a tracker and scout, due to her knowledge of the terrain. She served in this capacity until the defeat of the Lich King, only then returning south to lands she had not seen since she was a child. She has a low tolerance for hot weather, due to her being acclimated to the arctic climate of Northrend.<br/><br/>Threat Assessment:<br/><br/>Dangerous. Years of scouting alone in scourge held territory has taught her to move without detection, attacking from range with devestating accuracy. She tends not to seek out conflict however, fighting only when necessary

<strong><span class="underline">Name:</span></strong><br/>"Vectus" aka Vith Maldonst<br/><br/><br/><strong><span class="underline">Family History:</span></strong><br/>Son and sole heir of a Lordaeron nobleman. Only known survivor of a Scourge attack occurring late in his teenage years which killed his family and destroyed most of their estate.<br/><br/><br/><strong><span class="underline">Activity Brief:</span></strong><br/>After the attack, he fled south and joined the Stormwind infantry. Here, he rose to the rank of Lieutenant Commander after several years of distinctive service wherein he demonstrated his affinity for battle and tactical operations. Eventually, his commanding officer had him transferred to SI:7 to make better use of these skills.<br/><br/>Shortly after receiving the highest levels of training and being commissioned as a Covert Personnel Elimination Agent for SI:7, he was dishonorably discharged when information came to light about his personal life. Apparently, he had taken to staging the death of his marks, only to keep them alive so he could torture them at his leisure.<br/><br/>For four years thereafter, he worked as a freelance assassin and headed a group of elite mercenaries known only as "The Organization." The Organization quickly gained a reputation for its violent and often criminal operations, and was systematically shut down after key information about its members was leaked to Stormwind authorities. After this, the man then known as Vith Maldonst went into hiding. He resurfaced two years later under the alias "Vectus" as an undead within the Horde.<br/><br/>The exact circumstances surrounding his undeath are unknown, although the fact that to date he still displays none of the usual symptoms of undeath suggest it was not an accident, and that he achieved his current state purposefully and through unusual means.<br/><br/>Currently he is the commanding officer of the Ebon Reavers, the military division within the infamous and esoteric organization, "Modas il Toralar." No useful information has been gathered recently, as any reconnaissance agents sent to investigate the subject tend not to return.<br/><br/><br/><strong><span class="underline">Threat Assessment:</span></strong><br/>Vectus is a seasoned veteran of many battles, a highly skilled and resourceful assassin, and is well known by all who have fought alongside him for his exceptional displays of combat ability and tactical prowess. He often employs creative uses of his engineering and alchemical knowledge during battle to gain the upper hand, and is completely ruthless in his pursuit of victory. Although normally level-headed, he has been known to have bouts of impulsive sociopathy, making him highly unpredictable.<br/><br/>Vectus is wanted by most factions for a variety of heinous crimes, including mass murder, arson, torture, extortion, and the assassination of public officials. He is especially fond of abducting and torturing his victims, usually ritualistically carving various symbols into their flesh after he is finished with them.<br/><br/>Additionally, he is one of the highest-ranking members of the infamous and esoteric order, "Modas il Toralar."<br/><br/><strong><em>Confrontation of any kind is not advised. Approach at own risk.</em></strong>

NAME(S): Rillik Verogoth AKA: Sarge<br/><br/>FAMILY HISTORY: Parents: Thaler Verogoth - father, Arewien Verogoth - mother Siblings: Eowon Verogoth - brother<br/><br/>ACTIVITY BRIEF: Rillik Verogoth comes from a humble background, the son of the owner and operator of a textile mill near Andorhal. According to accounts from neighbors and local informants, the subject was a hard-working young man, but lacked any sense of self-advancement, seemingly content with living out the rest of his days as a miller and amateur tailor. Local lore holds that during the Third War, business for his father's mill boomed trying to keep up with orders from local militias and larger armies, and the subject and his younger brother, Eowon, were sent out to recruit extra laborers from what is now the Eastern Plaguelands. In transit, the pair was caught up in a battle between human defenders and a Scourge incursion force. The subject was killed defending his brother. As far as the citizens of the subject's hometown are concerned, his story ended there.<br/><br/>Subject disappeared from the known world after that, and did not resurface until the recent rebellion of the Knights of the Ebon Blade. Apparently, the subject's body was chosen for reanimation as one of the Lich King's death knights. He has not revealed much about his time under the sway of the Scourge, so little to nothing is known of how his time was spent.<br/><br/>However, it should be noted that the subject now displays a very healthy respect (almost obsession with) for decorum and order, suggesting that he took to the militaristic aspects of the Ebon Blade very well.<br/><br/>After returning to human civilization, the subject maintained a low profile for a while, fearing the repercussions of what he had become. Intelligence suggests that he did attempt contact with his family, but local informants report that they maintain the their son is dead and remain tight-lipped if questioned further.<br/><br/>Recently, however, the subject has been seen publicly more and more often, likely a direct result of his employment with the Alliance Branch of the AAMS. Also notable is the fact that after recent upheavals at the AAMS branch offices in Stormwind, it was the subject who oversaw the renovations, and he was witnessed purchasing materials for, and hiring craftsmen that specialize in, improved security measures. It can thus be inferred that his duties among the Ebon Blade included fortification security. <br/><br/>THREAT ASSESSMENT: While no accounts currently exist of the subject initiating violent behavior, his training among the Ebon Blade cannot be ignored. All successful (read: surviving) recruits among the death knights have undergone rigorous combat training and tests of the capacity for violence. Additionally, the subject is a member of the AAMS, and organization with ties among both the Alliance and the Horde. (see report on the AAMS for more details) Therefore, the subject may or may not have access to resources and/or contacts unavailable to most among the Alliance.<br/><br/>Further observation is recommended.<br/>

Name: Grammok a.k.a. Gram; No family name.<br/>Family: Unknown (Deceased)<br/>History: Little is known about this orc past before he sneaked through the Dark Portal. Before the end of the Second War, he was a peon, of unknown family, of the Thunderlords who escaped the brutal savage warrior culture of the Horde, in part because he was mocked and threatened for his relatively non violent temperament. Very young, he tried to make his way to the exiled Frost Wolves in the hopes that they would take him in. Inexperience nearly cost him his life had it not been for an eccentric old dwarf who took the youth in after after seeing him struggle through the wilds of the Eastern Kingdoms. Why the dwarf would do this is not known; Perhaps he sensed a kindred soul in the young orc. They lived almost as family for years and slowly the orc himself became a hunter.<br/><br/>Then Gram's world came tumbling down as he was seen by a near by patrol on one of his outings. He lost them and quietly made it back to the cabin he had with the old dwarf. As he got there he realized that the Patrol had had trackers of their own and followed the well worn Hunting trail back to home. His mentor refused to talk to the Soldiers and to turn in the student who was like a son to him. The sergeant of the patrol summarily executed the old dwarf as a traitor, beheading him with a sword stroke. Gram fled into the wilds and stayed there biding his time for years, harboring a loathing of humans. If it were not for Thrall's exodus, very likely he would have stayed in hiding. <br/><br/>He spend the third war as a simple scout, getting food to feed this new Horde and relearning his race's noble heritage as well as that of other races in the Horde. After the Battle of Hyjal he decided to see the world. He joined the Winds during the war in Outland after finally getting his over fear of loss, and has been with them ever since. <br/><br/>He explored Outlands and fought with distinction in Northrend. The Cataclysm and the so called Fourth War has brought out his old fears. This place in the world he has so struggled for. Thrall is gone, Cairne is dead, and hte Horde is going back to what seems to be its violent ways. Grams seems troubled, as his old prejudice of humans is coming back.<br/><br/>Threat Level: Gram seems relatively simple and easy going. If not engaged he is unlikely to fight. However, his long years as a hunter have made him a master of guerrilla warfare and small unit tactics. His simple ways hide a cunning mind and a nigh implacable will. His beast are fearsomely loyal to him and will stop at nothing to defend him. He will not fight face to face and always strikes from an advantage. Avoid combat or outmaneuver if engaging him.

Name : Shattering (Original name unknown)<br/>Family : Records lost<br/><br/>Known history : Shattering was one of the faceless nameless masses of the priesthood, toiling away at his duties serving a belief he did not share for day after identical day. <br/><br/>He had come to the priesthood as so many do, through accident of birth. Perhaps he was the youngest son of a large but not wealthy noble family, perhaps a farmer wanted something better for his child. In any case his position brought him no joy and he lived a life of gray drudgery and ritual... That is until the poisons rained from the sky.<br/><br/>The cold green mist muffled the screams as the township ran uselessly for cover, already choking on their own vomit and liquifying organs. Men, women, children, and animals fell as they fled and gurgled out their final incoherent cries. Shattering stood amidst the carnage, the world growing dim around him. His senses faded from the agonizing light of unknowable pain to the eternal and cold embrace of death. His body fell laughing to the cobblestones wet with lethal residue and the running blood of his congregation. He had finally found his faith.<br/><br/>Threat Assessment: Shattering is determined and fanatic, what he lacks in raw power he makes up for in a patient unwillingness to leave any target alive. He could become quite dangerous as his strength grows.<br/><br/>Likes : The sounds of bones snapping, the final breath of a dying man, rot and decay, flowers.<br/><br/>Dislikes : The living, sunrise, any who would oppose his new queen, and chickens.

Subject ID: U91035<br/>Subject Name: Poni Darkspear<br/>Subject Description: Troll, Darkspear, Female, average height/slim build/green fur<br/>Subject residence: private home/family longhouse, Barrens, Kalimdor<br/>Subject family status: married, 2 children (cross reference dossiers NX211/OV099/1701E)<br/>Subjects' living biological kin: one sister (dossier NI-596)<br/>Subject fingerprints: See attached card<br/><br/>Background: Limited information is available.<br/><br/>Poni was born and raised either in the in the village of Sen'jin. Subject and sister (still living) were orphaned at a young age after their parents were killed by a marauding band of murlocs.<br/><br/>Left to fend for themselves in the deserts of Kalimdor, the two troll sisters settled into a nomadic lifestyle. Subject Poni proved adept at hunting and tracking, and her sister by necessity learned the healing arts, especially skills related to patching up animal bites, clawswipes, and the like.<br/><br/>The two sisters were indispensable throughout their adolescence and well into their adult lives. Poni proved the more sociable of the two and has a husband and two children (and future children are likely due to Trolls' culture placing high value on children and large families). They currently reside in the Homeland 'guild' longhouse in the Barrens near Orgrimmar, although Poni and her family also maintain a nearby home.<br/><br/>Poni is known to strongly dislike the Horde's current Warchief, although she will not readily admit this fact in large groups or to the public at large. She feels that Garrosh's personality, disciplinary tactics, and political actions are too extreme and that continued war with the Alliance does not serve the people of either nation and only serves to benefit those in power.<br/><br/>Subject has a number of strong friendships with members of the Alliance, caring little for politics or nations and a great deal more for close personal ties. She is aware of the sentiments of King Varian Wrynn and Warchief Garrosh Hellscream, who both would frown upon her actions -- and refuses to pay any heed to those who tell her that no member of the Alliance can be trusted.<br/><br/>Subject has been seen receiving mail deliveries of apparent gnomish make, packed in boxes with the mark of Gnomeregan upon them, and yet has shown little to no desire or tendency to attempt overthrow of the Horde 'government' beyond the disagreement mentioned above.<br/><br/>Subject has shown extreme loyalty to her close (sister/husband/children) and extended (Homeland 'guild') and has more than once stated that she would do anything to protect, help, or rescue any of them. This may be exploitable (blackmail or similar).<br/><br/>Known threats: Assume subject is armed and dangerous at all times. Hunters are normally adept at both stringed weapons (bow/crossbow) and firearms (pistols and long guns). Subject is a skilled skinner/leatherworker and is therefore likely also armed with a knife even if no visible weapon can be seen.<br/><br/>Minor note: Subject is left-handed.

NAME: Jindall (family name unknown)<br/><br/>FAMILY HISTORY: Parents deceased. Sharis (sister, whereabouts unknown). Threewinds (brother-in-law, whereabouts unknown).<br/><br/>ACTIVITY BRIEF: Jindall joined the ranks of the Horntotem as a defender of Mulgore. Whenever there was an attack in Mulgore, he and the other members in HT would return to Bloodhoof Village and begin the search for the attacker. He was eventually awarded the title of “Senior Sergeant” in the defense of various horde occupied territory during his travels, a recognition he did not ask for.<br/><br/>In the past, various members of the horde often sought his gifted healing abilities. He would aid those that called for him, never turning away anyone. <br/><br/>In time, Jindall learned that his sister was alive. He always felt comfortable whenever he was around Sharis, but didn’t know why. (Sharis was also a member of HT and eventually married the leader, Threewinds. See dossier on HT for more information). It was through a spiritual ceremony that connected the dots; he thought he lost her when they got separated during a centaur attack.<br/><br/>Harnessing the power of the arcane, Jindall mastered the moonkin form. Things fell apart shortly after acquiring the form. He left the HT. Afterwards, the members of HT dispersed and their whereabouts are unknown. (See dossier on HT for more information).<br/><br/>He later was accepted as a member of Ishnu por Ah. Unbeknown to the members of IPA, his owlkin form took a toll on his mind. Jindall randomly unleashed hurricanes on top of Thunder Bluff at various times of days, scaring random civilians and passersby. One day, he committed suicide in front of various members of IPA; jumping off the Spirit Rise, he grabbed Avaryne with him as he jumped. His body broke her fall. His suicide was not fatal. To this day, he regrets his actions and has never used the moonkin form again. No one speaks of that day. Jindall tends to keep to himself since that event. (This knowledge can be used to incite the tauren.)<br/><br/>Ever since he returned, Jindall used his power of the bear to help defend and attack those that try to harm his friends. He used his druid powers in Outlands and Northrend; eventually the eruption of the Cataclysm dictated he returned home to Desolace where he aided the Cenarion Circle.<br/><br/>THREAT ASSESSMENT: It is safe to assume that this bull is hostile when it is necessary, otherwise approachable by anybody. However, should this tauren ever revert back to his owlkin form, both horde and alliance should keep their distance. It is unknown how Jindall would behave; based on the past, he could be very dangerous to everyone and we recommend taking him out before he harms anyone.<br/><br/>

NAME(S): Jol'Kayden Markos and Jol'Casta Markos AKA: The Twins, Frick and Frack<br/><br/>FAMILY HISTORY: Jol'Qaren Markos - Father (deceased), ??? - Mother (assumed deceased) other family unknown<br/><br/>ACTIVITY BRIEF: Subjects born year 610 of King's Calender. Subjects' mother reportedly lost her life giving birth to subjects. Subjects' father left to raise infants on his own. Reports of childhood activity spotty, but it can be inferred that subjects had a normal home life. During the events of the Scourge of Lordaeron, subjects' father fled with his sons, eventually settling in Andorhal. From this event until the subjects' application to the Argent Crusade, reports are incomplete, but it can be confirmed that subjects' father was killed violently, and this event changed the personalities of the subjects' irrevocably. The subjects began training martially, with Subject #1 focusing on harnessing the "Light" and Subject #2 learning the ways of demonology.<br/><br/>There seems to be some strife among the subjects regarding each subject's choice of focus, however the conflict is noticeably less prevalent in Subject #2 than in #1. <br/><br/>Upon completion of subjects' training, they reunited and applied for membership with the Argent Crusade. After surviving the trials posed to potential members, subjects were denied entry into the order. Informants within the Argent Crusade claim that official documents cite concern for the continued mental state of Subject #1 for the denial of their application, but when questioned on the reasoning, all involved parties (including the subjects) state that the subjects were passed over due to Subject #2's involvement with demonic forces.<br/><br/>Recently, subjects attained employment with AAMS <em>&lt;see file for this organization></em> and, according to informants, remain probationary members of the organization. Subjects are reported to have been accompanied on "training exercises" by AAMS management, including Vasilia Starfallen. <em>&lt;see subject file #64-357A002></em><br/><br/>THREAT ASSESSMENT: Subjects are capable, ruthless combatants. However, subjects seem to focus their attention on targets they deem "worthy" of their attentions. If approached with offers to assist in their personal crusade, subjects are affable and cooperative. Of particular concern is the mental and emotional state of Subject #1. If an organization such as the Argent Crusade is worried about someone's mental state, observation is warranted.

NAME : Ungunguh<br/><br/>FAMILY HISTORY : Unknown<br/><br/>ACTIVITY BRIEF : Ungunguh crawled out of the ground incomplete. His grave had been previously defiled, leaving him without a lower jaw. With few vocal options, he apparently chose a name he could pronounce. He has never given another.<br/><br/>Ungunguh is seldom seen without the company of an animal - most recently an ape. Few have been able to engage him in conversation, even after he acquired a lower jaw of unknown origin. He has recently been seen in the company of two other Forsaken (see attached for Shattering and Dolmund).<br/><br/>Subject is just one of many faceless (literally, in this case) Forsaken raised by Sylvanas to serve her many whims. While Ungunguh serves her faithfully, it seems clear he is pursuing his own ends as well. He has been spotted killing for what would optimistically be called 'sport', leaving trails of skinless corpses - man and beast alike - in his wake. The skins are often found ruined and in a heap near the killings. Prevailing opinion is that he is 'practicing' for something - a thought that brings little comfort.<br/><br/>When it comes to the human nobility, Subject is known to be particularly cruel when possible. He has been overheard to rail on the topics of the nobility and family. It is likely the circumstances of his death involved both.<br/><br/>THREAT ASSESSMENT : Ungunguh is openly hostile, cruel and vicious to humans, especially the high-born. However, behind his threats and ominous talk, he is only a Forsaken with an ape. Any reasonably well trained guard should be capable of dispatching him with ease.

Name:<br/>Kanaohe Windrunner<br/><br/>Family History: unknown<br/><br/>Activity Brief:<br/><br/>for years she had been a hunter for her people, traveling the lands with her hyena Missy (see attached report on possible bio toxin from hyena breath).She had fought in both the campaign against the Burning Legion, and against the Lich King's forces in Northrend. Something changed in her however at the battle of the Wrathgate. She became quiet, moody, unsure of her path even as she fought through Icecrown, a quiet hate of the Forsaken growing (note, it is suspected that she lost someone close to her when rogue forsaken turned against both the horde and the alliance during that battle). Her desire for revenge against the scourge kept her going through those long cold months. <br/><br/>Once Arthas was defeated however, she was at a loss on what to do. Months of working with the Argent Crusade had opened her to the possibility of new paths, when the Sunwalkers were founded she was one of the first to apply for training, starting over from scratch. She has risen through the order and proven herself in battle, both against the Alliance and others who would threaten her people.<br/><br/>Threat Assessment:<br/><br/>While she is still learning the art of her new calling, she still has years of combat and tracking experience. She is more dangerous than would seem at first glance, approach with caution.

NAME: Yotingo<br/><br/>FAMILY HISTORY: Parents are deceased of old age, subject does not seem to have gotten along with them particularly well. Many siblings in the manner of trolls, though their names and current whereabouts are unknown.<br/><br/>ACTIVITY BRIEF: Was trained as a small-game hunter and herb gatherer while he lived in the jungles of Stranglethorn among the Darkspear trolls. One day he reported hearing voices, and his tribe's shaman took the young troll under his wing upon realizing Yotingo could see and speak to spirits. Yotingo crossed over with Thrall to live in Durotar around the age of ten. Soon after, he left to join the tauren in Mulgore to complete his training in shamanism. He seems more comfortable around tauren than among his birth race.<br/><br/>Yotingo has always had an interest in history, diplomacy and engineering, and has written a few books on the former subject. Soon after finishing his training with the tauren, he signed on with the AAMS as a courier, and later, as upper management. Yotingo spent all of two weeks as the CEO of the company, before promoting a blood elf called Akiae into the position and taking on the position of Manager for himself.<br/><br/>Yotingo disappeared shortly after this, about five years prior to the Cataclysm (just before the Lich King was destroyed), only reappearing recently again in Kalimdor. Theories about where he was during this time vary, the most popular two being in another timeline or even in another world. Since then, his movements have been difficult to track, as he appears disinterested in his old life and keeps an emotional distance from other people. Yotingo plied his courier duties and fought in many of the Northrend battles prior to his disappearance, and perhaps the horrors encountered there are the reason for this distancing of himself.<br/><br/>THREAT ASSESSMENT: Typically peaceful (if a bit gullible), difficult to rile up. True capabilities are not known for this reason, and caution is advised.

NAME: Dustwing (thought to be a nickname only)<br/><br/>FAMILY HISTORY: He speaks fondly of a remembered son, sister, and nephew, though even he is not certain of their current whereabouts.<br/><br/>ACTIVITY BRIEF: Little can be gleaned about Dustwing's past, although the night elf is conjectured to be more than 1000 years old. What little written below has been taken out of the records of one Kildrad "Wildmane" Al'sharen, a deceased night elf lieutenant who bears significant resemblance to Dustwing, in manner, bearing, and appearance. Note that their relation and shared history is conjecture only, and the latter two paragraphs bear the only past that is known for certain.<br/><br/>Expected heir of his House, Kildrad was trained from a very young age to be a leader, especially in combat situations due to the military traditions of his upbringing. He experienced trouble within the family, and a schism between would-be druids and soldiers trained for more mundane combat. For this reason he never picked up druidism like most male night elves are expected to in kaledorei society, though his sister and later his nephew went against the conventionally accepted means of their family and became druids later in life. This caused an uproar in the family, for most females are typically not allowed in the druidic ranks, and the nephew is suspected of delving into the forbidden arts of the Druids of the Scythe.<br/><br/>Kildrad fought and commanded forces in many wars, most specifically the war with the Silithid one thousand years ago, the battle at Mount Hyjal, and the more recent wars against the Burning Legion, the Scourge, and the Horde. He worked extensively with the Argent Dawn and the Aldor as such, and is considered an honored name in both organizations.<br/><br/>This is where the records become uncertain. Kildrad was reported to have led a mixed group of Argent Dawn and Alliance troops deep into Icecrown. The entire platoon disappeared, guessed to have been wiped out in a surprise attack by the Scourge, their bodies buried in a freak avalanche. It is uncertain how many people, if any, survived this catastrophe.<br/><br/>Whether or not Dustwing and Kildrad are one and the same, Dustwing refuses to speak much about his past. For now, the night elf loner wanders the world, pitching in to help stranger travelers or communities as he sees fit.<br/><br/>THREAT ASSESSMENT: A competent archer, skilled in training animals for combat. Remains calm and rational in a fight. Believed to also be an experienced commander, and with the right encouragement, a valuable ally to have in any kind of organized warfare.

Name: <br/>Rhyas <br/><br/>Family History. <br/>Unknown <br/><br/>Activity Brief:<br/>This druid apparantly has little or no ties to anyone whatsoever, no group to call her own. She appears to be working alongside the Dragonmaw Clan in the Twilight Highlands for the Cataclysm effort. She has a high temper, and does not seem to be schooled at all, rather she appears to be ignorant of most magic, and of even common knowledge. She is normally found prowling around in cat form, or rarely, in bear form. <br/><br/>From what was gathered, she has lived in the wild as a druid for most of her life, and is very protective of it. Her help given in the cataclysm is apparantly due to her affinity for nature.<br/><br/>Threat Assessment:<br/>Highly dangerous. She's attacked several members of the horde and alliance alike. She does not take much to incite and she holds lifetime grudges.

NAME: Symmasris Shen'Dralar<br/><br/>FAMILY HISTORY: Mother (Deceased) Father - Tharsillan (Missing, Presumed Dead) Taydrel (Brother, Missing, Presumed Dead) Sizara (First Wife, Missing, presumed Dead) Syllea (Adopted Daughter, Missing, Presumed Dead) <br/><br/>ACTIVITY BRIEF: <br/>Prior to his death and turn into a Death Knight Symmasris was a mage of some regard, however, during the defense of the Sunwell, he, along with many powerful members of the High Elves fell. His family life was broken, his father going on long journeys, however, he had disappeared, no sign of him. He is presumed dead. He lived with his older brother and his Mother in Silvermoon. He, had rushed to the Sunwell for its defense, but had died. Later he was raised as a Death Knight.<br/><br/>After his break from the Lich King, Symmasris sought out his old home in Silvermoon, though, it was still in shambles. At a nearby bar, he met up with his brother, who invited him to his order, The Blood Order. He stayed there a while, and had met Sizara, his future wife. She and their adopted child disappeared in Northrend. He did not do much in the following months, until he fell in love with another girl, Xevory, a perky young mage, the polar opposite of his first wife. Them and their friend Zaerathian disappeared for some time as well. Only Symmasris has returned. He has actively worked through the events in outlands, but has been docile since the cataclysm. Not much is known past this date.<br/><br/>THREAT ASSESSMENT:<br/>Dangerous. This Death Knight has a short temper, especially if related to something about his lost family. Do not approach.

<strong>NAME: </strong> Galag Battlebrew. <br/><br/><strong>FAMILY HISTORY:</strong> Scrimjin Battlebrew (Grandfather) Madin Battlebrew (Grandmother) Sargan Stronghammer ( Grandfather Mothers side ) Lilan Stronghammer (Grandmother Mother's side) Malgan Battlebrew (Father) Odala Battlebrew ( Mother ) Glan, Bern, Nance, Lempka, Tarma, Softee, Roawan, and Maddy ( Sisters ) <br/><br/><strong>ACTIVITY BRIEF: </strong><br/><br/>Galag is the youngest child of the Battlebrew clan and the only male born to his parents. During his formative years he was primary raised by his Father and Grandfather so that he would not turn into a "sissy boy" due to having nine older sisters who wanted dote on him. The the day he was old enough to pick up his first hammer the two elder Battlebrews taught him how to fight, smith and drink and even shipped him off to the to the dwarven battle brigades.<br/><br/>Like many of his kind Galag spent his first 60 or so years either in near a battlefield or a tavern and seems to thrive in either environment. <br/><br/> For most of his life Galag was a standard master at arms preferring the sword and shield style of combat but that changed a couple of years ago due to a chance encounter with a Draenei shaman named Kalthosh.<br/><br/>See file: Kalthosh<br/><br/>The two men got involved in a challenge of ale and brew. After almost a day neither seemed to relent which earned the Draneni a great deal of respect from the dwarf. That started a friendship between the two even to the point that Kalthosh offered to teach the dwarf shamanish. When asked why he accepted the offer Galag has been quoted as saying <br/>"I be able ta put lightin on me hammers! Why wouldn't ya wanna ne learnin this?"<br/><br/><br/><strong>THREAT ASSESSMENT:</strong> Since then he has put his new found ability to very deadly use in many of the battlegrounds across our world. He is fiercely loyal to his those his calls friend and will stop at nothing to protect them. Galag also has an intense dislike for the Tauren due to losing a good friend who was assigned to Bael Modan. <br/><br/>Beyond the standard racial desire for combat and ale Galag is a fairly rational man who is even tempered ( for a dwarf anyway )<br/><br/>

<strong>Name:</strong> Shauraria Wildsong<br/><strong>Nickname:</strong> Ria<br/><strong>Age:</strong> 244 (approximately 14 years old by human standards)<br/><br/><strong>Family History:</strong> Mother and "cousins" deceased <em>(from Deathwing's attack on the Park),</em> Father deceased <em>(from the destruction of Auberdine)</em>, Valiriel Wildsong <em>(assumed older sister)</em><br/><br/><strong>Activity Brief:</strong> Up until the sundering Ria lived in Auberdine and traveled to Stormwind City on special occasions. Her mother was a druid and her father a hunter. From a young age Ria took a liking to animals; therefore, spent most of her life by her father's side. Ria's father sent her out with the first group that evacuated Auberdine. <br/><br/>After making it to Lor'Danel she decides to make her way to Stormwind to see if her mother and "cousins" survived. To her dismay, only an older sister she didn't know was alive <em>(see file on Valiriel Wildsong)</em>. She returned to Lor'Danel and traveled down to Ashenvale.<br/><br/>She returned to Stormwind wounded with a worgen <em>(see file on Jonathan Faxton)</em>. There she met with Gentyl. She hasn't left Stormwind and has been seen with Keyesh Shadowstorm. <br/><br/><strong>Threat Assessment:</strong> Ria is kind and innocent to a fault. She poses very little threat at this moment. However, further observations should be made to see her position on the Barrens conflict.
