Name(s): Rose Grenwall AKA Fallenrose. Flame Warden of the Tenth Legion.<br/><br/>Family History: Father: Marico (Alive, stuck as a Draenei), Mother: Lisa (deceased), Siblings: Kera (Oldest sister, deceased), Celesa (Youngest sister, deceased). Wulfgrin Stormforge (Alive, Guardian).<br/><br/>Activity Brief: Growing up with her family in Moonbrook, Rose was the second daughter of Marico and Lisa. At a young age, Rose learned quickly the ability to cause fire and manipulate its power. However, given her age, she was unable to control it properly and generally caused more damage around her in fits of childish tantrums. With the help of her father and older sister kera, they began to train her to control those outbursts.<br/><br/>At this time, Marico enrolled his children to take part of experiments believed to be sanctioned by the nobles and run by a man known only as Sarken. Kera and Rose took part in the experiments while Celesa was too young. Though painful and showing little results, the experiments were complete. Weeks passed and little Celesa fell ill. Marico and Kera went to the city to find a skilled doctor to help her. While they were away, Rose stayed home with her mother and ill sister. Hearing her sister cry, a sleepy Rose went to her room and found her mother standing over the bed where Celesa lay. In her tired state, Rose thought she saw her mother choking Celesa and flew into a rage, burning her and everything around her. Celesa herself was believed to already be dead, when in fact was forced into the experiment by Sarken.<br/><br/>With the experiment at the threat of exposer, Sarken sent out an assassin to kill the thirteen children selected to cover any evidence of what he was doing. To keep her safe and partly because he could not face her, Marico placed Rose in the care of a Dwarf. He was to keep her in the city to continue her studies. After this time, both Marico and Kera vanished outside the history logs.<br/><br/>Years pass and an older more headstrong Rose grew up. Feeling abandoned and alone, she strived to be noticed. During this time, the Stonemasons turned their backs on Stormwind and left to form the Defias. Feeling a need to belong somewhere, Rose left the academy to join them. There are reports here and there about her travels with them, but none reported as clear as Moonbrook. When the Defias attacked the town, Rose was reported to be one of the more ruthless of the attackers and even was seen attacking the school herself. What happens during the attack is still a mystery, but for whatever reason, Rose turned on her commanding officer Sheknee Tatarus and began protecting the fleeing villagers. Not taking the betrayal lightly, Sheknee quickly defeated Rose and nearly killed her had it not been for Wulfgrins interruption. Sheknee would later fall in the woods of Duskwood.<br/><br/>It was revealed in Duskwood that Rose had fallen prey to a powerful mind control spell in Moonbrook. The spell scrambled her memories and forced her to take on the role of a protector. In his dying breath, Sheknee told the location of another person she had forgotten, Sarken. Upon arriving to Sarkens location, Rose is reunited with Kera, who had already killed Sarken in revenge. Kera explained to Rose about the experiments trying to splice the powers of arcane and shadow using dead demons. Celesa was the final subject in that test and it had gone wrong. The demon sent to her was alive and fought to possess her. However, Celesa not only won her fight, but took over the demon as well, fully controlling its power. Though victorious, her body was too fragile and weak from the fight and began to die. Their mother had come in to revive her and succeeded moments before Rose came in the room. In the fire, Celesa was able to escape and survive. Kera explained that Celesa was planning to use her powers to destroy the nobles who allowed the experiments to happen. Agreeing to help stop her, Rose and her companions set out to find Celesa. After days of searching, she is found and the battle began. Moments into the battle, Wulfgrin and several companions fall while Rose and Kera fought on. As the fight continued on, Kera finds an opening and sacrifices herself to bring Celesa to a weakened state allowing Rose to kill her. Once the battle finished, Kera made Rose promise to use her strength to protect those around her. To redeem herself for the things she did to her family and Moonbrook.<br/><br/>Threat Assessment: Dangerous if given a focus. Using her knowledge of Gnomish tech, she strives to be prepared for any situation and uses combat tactics not seen often. She prefers to fight up close even though she is not built for it and will fight no matter the numbers against her. Not a leader of anything, but will help in defensive or offensive gatherings whenever possible. If planning to attack a town, prepare for a fight…and beware the Chicken Machine.

Name(s): Ceridwyn, Sa'adven<br/><br/>Familial History: Unknown parentage. One adopted daughter (Ceden), age 23.<br/><br/>Activity Brief: Long-time Horde supporter, originally serving the Bleeding Hollow Clan as first a scout and forward observer under the Amani empire banner, and later as a small force commander as a berserker. Highly active during the Second War in Lordaeron at the time, and specifically noted as particularly vicious during these times. Near the end of the war, captured and rather then executed, was for unknown reasons held at an internment camp in Hillsbrad along with a significant portion of the Horde forces at the time. Remained here until the orcish liberation by Thrall. Reports of her internment suggest that her disposition slowly improved over her stay, mostly spending her time with spiritual leaders of the orc tribes. Name mispronunciation here likely led to her current alias - reason unknown.<br/><br/>Following the liberation, stayed heavily active in Lordaeron in an attempt to reconnect with the Amani empire and specifically locate Zul'jin. This persisted throughout the Third War, until she finally gave up her search as futile and instead worked her way to Kalimdor to instead rejoin the Horde, citing that she had yet to finish out her service and a debt to Thrall left mostly unnamed. Initial social friction with the Darkspear tribe (mutual dislike on both sides) slowly eroded as she continued her role as scout throughout Kalimdor, and gained some small fame as a skirmisher and defender of Horde settlements (barring those of the Forsaken, which she still has open contempt for as a whole, and later the Blood elves for similar reasons).<br/><br/>During the Draenor campaign, she was often on the front lines providing information of Burning Legion activity to the Horde, as well as occasionally staging solitary raids on Alliance outposts for information and, it seems, mostly out of habit. Disappeared off the radar during the assault on Quel'danas, and was not seen again until the Northrend campaign, where she joined the general infantry and continued her front-line presence. Once again disappeared during the final assault on Icecrown, though there have been reports of her across The Barrens and in Hyjal at the start of the campaign against the Twilight's Hammer cult. Whereabouts currently unknown - has suggested in her brief visits in the past that such disappearances are 'fishing trips' or the result of her 'writing her memoirs'.<br/><br/>Threat Assessment: Highly dangerous. This individual has a long-standing tradition of not only being present on the front lines of a majority of the worst engagements and conflicts in Azeroth's recent history, but of excelling in these situations through guile, tenacity, and sheer brute force. She has also been incredibly hard to pin down, being a master of a number of covert operations techniques and guerilla tactics built up over years of constant service. Her recent talents as a shaman also complicate matters, as she has exhibited a very potent mastery of the elements and maintains steady connections with the Amani loa (despite reports of her falling out with the empire after Zul'jin's demise). Believed to also have some form of Shadow Hunter or Witch Doctor training, though there has been no evidence of this to date (or at least no evidence that cannot be attributed to shamanism instead).<br/><br/>Do not engage alone, and take extreme caution when pursuing or tracking this individual.

Name: Gileyne Mayweather Felbells, alias Gilly<br/><br/>Family History: Parents deceased, no known children.<br/><br/>Activity Brief: Early life is mostly given only to her own testimonial, despite the fact she has a number of fans of her literary work and numerous attempts have been made to glean more of her past history (or at least confirm her ramblings). It's not even entirely sure how she got into the demonologist profession at all. The grand majority of her prior history can be assumed to have been spent in Undermine. Follows is her own version of what her life was like (again, note none of this can be confirmed at all):<br/><br/>"I lived in a fairly normal goblin household. Parents were bankers, and very disappointed that I didn't really care about money at all. In fact, a lot of my peers at the time didn't quite understand that money doesn't motivate me as much as it does other goblins. I mean, don't get me wrong, I love gold and I love getting paid more then anything - sometimes I roll around in my book royalties payments when nobody's looking - but it's not something I particularly worry about too much.<br/><br/>I love information. I love facts, I love history, I love just plain finding things out and then talking about it with other people. This sort of tended to annoy those that couldn't see any monetary benefit in my ramblings, but thankfully my agent convinced me that if I love research so much, why didn't I just turn it into a business? So, I sort of did, and that led to the publication of my first book ("Demonology: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Enslave Demons" -ed) that became a best-seller. In fact, that got me a gig with Schnottz to go off and investigate this or that set of ruins until his, er.. Untimely demise. He was a lout anyway, though.<br/><br/>That's pretty much how I spent my life. Going off to here, researching that, poking at ruins, dating this or that person, publicity stunts... Then the Cataclysm happened, and I got stuck on an island with some crazy blood elf that I'm pretty sure was a pirate after I was shipwrecked on my way to a new digsite that had just opened up in the Stonetalon Mountains. I'm not sure how, but I ended up getting signed up with the Horde army and assumed to be working with the Bilgewater Cartel (and that Gallywix piker - ugh, as IF!) for reasons beyond my comprehension. But, they sent me off to first Hyjal (Oh, the things there), Deepholme (not fit for goblin nor beast), and Uldum (where I was unfortunately reunited with Schnottz who is still upset that I broke things off with him; I have standards he couldn't hope to live up to with that stupid accent of his!). I guess I can't really complain...<br/><br/>I'm learning a lot of stuff."<br/><br/>It's worth noting that the editor of the above portion would like to be duly compenstated for having to listen to her ramble on, and on, and on for hours. No one should be subjected to that.<br/><br/>Threat Assessment: Besides being a warlock of average ability, she's no real threat to anyone except perhaps her agent. If there's any threat from her at all, it's due in part to the demonic company she keeps (specifically the felhunter, Czaanoms, who is far more intelligent then it seems like he should be on occasion) and less any personal threat that she herself provides (though she is by no means a total pushover, having more luck then any other being I've seen and an incredible knack for being at the right place, at the right time). Or perhaps through her complete and utter disregard for safety, a trait common amongst goblins in general.<br/><br/>Why are we even keeping tabs on her? What harm could she possibly be?

Name :Raechka, Rae, 'that crazy squirrel lady'<br/><br/>Family: Sister, Poni, brother in law Carnar<br/><br/>Activity Brief:<br/><br/>you gotta be kidding me. We're monitoring her? This Troll doesn't seem to be all there, if you know what I mean. She claims to be the high priestess for an entity calling itself 'Bushtail the Reaper', the, uhm, squirrel Loa. Yes, Squirrel. Not exactly the kind of God to be inspiring fear in one's enemies.<br/><br/>Anyway, she's a competent healer, though doesn't tend to seek out combat. She recently was transformed into a Sin'dorei, due to her falling asleep in the Sunwell for two weeks during a visit. Yes, IN the well. Reportedly it was because 'it seemed like a good idea at the time'. She has since reverted back to her normal form, as if normal really applies to her. She seems to be a talented engineer, however the mechanical squirrel that accompanies her everywhere is a bit odd...we managed to steal it, but it's nothing but a hollow metal shell. No idea on how it moves, we disassembled it and there was nothing inside. Even more odd, the tech who was investigating it later was found fifty feet up in a tree, screaming something about 'squirrely wrath' before jumping to his death. Strange, but then he was always a bit high strung. <br/><br/>Threat Assessment. As stated, she doesn't seem to seek out conflict. She usually performs support roles when she does, though occasionally has been seen using shadow magics when attacked. Still, compared to her sister and especially her brother in law, I'd have to rate her harmless-wait..whats that chittering? Who the heck put that mechanical squirrel in my office? And why is it staring at m-<br/><br/>*the notes stop here, and at the bottom of the page in a bloody scribble are the words 'mostly harmless' *

NAME: Zakutazzar<br/><br/>FAMILY HISTORY: Unknown. <br/><br/>ACTIVITY BRIEF: Little is known about the hunter. Initial observation shows nothing peculiar about him. He seems to have a penchant for checking the mailbox every other hour. Apparently, this troll has a business relationship with someone in the horde. What kind of business? Who is the partner? We have no clue.<br/><br/>Between frequent naps and checking the mailbox, when did this troll pick up the enchanting profession? Did I doze off on the job after learning his napping schedule? We intercepted a package sent to the troll. Inside in the package were instructions to disenchant the items and sell them at the auction house. Any profits gained from the selling of all disenchanted materials were to be kept. Definitely an unwise business decision, unless the sender didn’t care for the gold. Sender’s name was nowhere found on the package. We carefully sealed and returned the package into the delivery system so it wouldn’t disrupt the timely arrival of said package. <br/><br/>In the wake of the Cataclysm, Zakutazzar has been more active in day-to-day business. He finally ventured out of Mulgore and went to work for various factions that requested aid. He recently entered the ranks of Ishnu Por Ah as a caretaker of some sort. I think it had to do with the collection of various pets and animals he had following him. Everyone has a use.<br/><br/>THREAT ASSESSMENT: Only dangerous if you consider one of his trait is to put pets to sleep by giving them a belly rub. Otherwise, he is quite harmless. His pets look more threatening than the troll.<br/>

NAME(S) : Rakko Ainu, meaning Otter of the People in his island Shu’halo dialect. Typically called Otter.<br/><br/>FAMILY : Unknown, presumed dead<br/><br/>ACTIVITY BRIEF:<br/>His presence was noticed soon after the cataclysm and was at first thought to be one of many Tauren who have begun to open themselves up the rebirth of sun worship among the Tauren people. But later research has shown that he is actually from a long lost island tribe.<br/><br/>On his island home, now thought to be destroyed by a volcanic eruption created by the rise of Deathwing, his tribe were fervent worshippers of the Sun and he claims that all his people were at one time trained at the temple and part of the temple society as what the Tauren currently call Sunwalkers or Priests. Only those truly dedicated remained within the temple after initial training. He himself became a priest and apprenticed as a brewmaster, beers being an important part of their worship. It is believed that he may be the last of his tribe, having escaped from the destruction of his home by floating across the ocean on top of an empty keg.<br/><br/>Found by goblins off the shores of Tanaris, he was returned to Mulgore as it was mistakenly thought to be his home. There he met a newly trained Sunwalker named Hoka and the two have been inseparable since. Their joined exploits caught the eye of Matriarch Red Earth of the Ishnu Por Ah and now they carry with them the name of that clan.<br/><br/>Otter speaks very little orc, but is slowly learning. Unlike some of the more outspoken Ishnu Por Ah members, he does not seem as interested in their fight in the Barrens, though war does seem to be a concern of his. Claiming to be a talented brewmaster, it is his belief that the reason there are so many wars between all the different people is because the fire of the sun burns too hot within them. And the solution is to find for each the right beer to cool the fiery soul. As a result, he has made it his mission to discover the right brews to calm each of the different people’s souls and bring peace to the world.<br/><br/>THREAT ASSESSMENT : He seems to be of little danger to anyone. Though if his hypothesis about beer being the solution to the warring woes of the world proves to be true, he may be someone war profiteers might have an interest in eliminating.<br/>

NAME: Durkas Winterhoof, Shieldsworn of the Order of the Ebon Shield<br/><br/>FAMILY: Mosswalker family of the Winterhoof tribe; one sister, currently living in Mulgore; one cousin, currently serving with Horde forces in Feralas; all others believed deceased.<br/><br/>ACTIVITY BRIEF: Durkas was first recorded as a recruit of the Order of the Ebon Shield (OES) mercenaries, shortly before the first appearance of Naxxramas. He subsequently served OES contracts with the Horde at most hotspots in Outland and Northrend, as well as numerous non-government and private contracts. He currently holds NCO-equivalent rank, with duties including front line combat and receiving verbal abuse. Politically, he is a supporter of the Horde, but has at times expressed support for neutral organizations and peace efforts with the Alliance. He appears to maintain personal contacts with members of the AAMS, Ishnu Por Ah, and Grim Maw Clan, although his interactions with the latter seem to be<em> extremely</em> traumatic.<br/><br/>Durkas was born to the Mosswalker lineage of the Winterhoof tribe in Southern Feralas, a group of hunters and herbalists. His own accounts indicate that his family relationships were strained, as a result of his shamanistic talents and the training they required. The exact nature of this training is unknown, but can be surmised to have been "highly unpleasant." Evidence of his difficult discipline and conflicted childhood can be found in Durkas's extensive list of neurotic behaviors and tics, including but not limited to: pacing, blinking, staring, beard-scratching, mumbling, murmuring, staring in speechlessness, spending too much time as a ghost wolf, alcoholism, obsession with body piercing and scarring, obsession with the shinbones of Forsaken undead, and potion abuse.<br/><br/>Most of Durkas's family is believed killed in the Shattering. He spent several months incommunicado after the event, in Thousand Needles and Feralas. There have been no obvious changes in his personality since his return, although he has recently become involved in the raids on the Alliance in the Southern Barrens.<br/><br/>THREAT ASSESSMENT: Moderate. Durkas is a fairly non-aggressive and moderately ethical individual, unlikely to initiate a confrontation. He is, however, a professional soldier and a fairly skilled shaman, and can cause a great deal of destruction on the battlefield. He is dangerous if confronted directly, but can be neutralized with stealth, or "biochemical" weapons of certain kinds (cf. Abominus, "Ichor," Borelgore)

NAME(S): Cray Auchtin<br/><br/>FAMILY HISTORY: Martin Auchtin (father, deceased), Valena Auchtin (mother, presumed dead, no body ever found)<br/><br/>ACTIVITY BRIEF: Too little to be of consequence in the first two wars, although he survived by some miracle -- despite having been born in Goldshire. His father, a warrior, protected him as they fled the doomed village -- his mother was not so lucky as to escape and disappeared during the course of the battle.<br/><br/>As soon as he was old enough, Martin Auchtin began to train Cray in combat. By the time the Third War began, Cray was a skilled warrior with a variety of weapons, although he favored (and continue to) the use of axes. Cray and his father both fought in the war. Cray returned alive, his father did not.<br/><br/>Cray has a rather large sum of gold he has inherited from his father, and a small apartment in the Cathedral Square of Stormwind which he called his home for many years after the Third War. The death of his father left Cray very angry, causing him to enter a self-destructive spiral of addiction to alcohol. He was discovered, drunk, in the Cathedral of Light by Archbishop Benedictus. Cray was converted to the Church of the Light, swearing off alcohol and training to become a Paladin. As a Paladin, he was involved in numerous excursions by the remnants of the Silver Hand, the Argent Dawn, and the Argent Crusade. Though he performed well, he was of little consequence at the time. For further details, please review our dossiers on his respective organizations rather than this.<br/><br/>With the Shattering, Cray's entire life changed. He was ordered to continue watching the Scourge and cleaning up undead, however Cray felt his duty to protect the people of Azeroth meant he should be concentrating on the Twilight's Hammer. He disobeyed his orders and left the Argent Crusade. Though he trained extensively, Cray found himself returning to his former addiction.<br/><br/>Fortunately <em>for him</em>, he encountered the Pia Presidium before he could do too much damage to himself or others. He has been struggling to avoid drinking as much as possible since then, but seems to have replaced mead with an addiction to gnomish ice cream.<br/><br/>Since joining Pia Presidium, Cray has proven he can be a stand out soldier in combat in a group or alone. He has proven an asset in battles against the Horde, and in law enforcement efforts made by the Stormwind City Watch. Observations must continue -- his rise in confidence has made him far less predictable than previously surmised.<br/><br/>THREAT ASSESSMENT: Cray's brash temper makes him a threat to anyone who has not planned on dealing with him. In a group setting, Cray is an even bigger threat as he will attempt to protect all others with him with a fervor that is seen in few others. When dealing with this one, it is best to keep him unarmed and isolated. Please note: do not leave him with items that could be used as weapons!

NAME(S): Ulfrec<br/><br/>FAMILY HISTORY: Martin Auchtin (father, deceased), Valena Auchtin (mother, presumed dead, no body ever found)<br/><br/>ACTIVITY BRIEF: Ulfrec was born to a tavern wench in Gilneas City. She died due to illness when he was very young. No records of his whereabouts since this time exist until during the Gilnean Civil War.<br/><br/>Reports state that during the Gilnean Civil War, Ulfrec admitted to having been a street urchin for his entire childhood. He was questioned about the recent string of murders in Gilneas City, credited to the "Silencer of Screams". Ulfrec seemed to have no knowledge of the murders, other than that they had occurred. He sought shelter from the streets, taking the attention from the guard as an opportunity to attempt to find a home. He was not helped, and once again disappeared.<br/><br/>Recently, Ulfrec has arrived in Stormwind City. He is very obviously a bearer of the Worgen curse, so much so that his eyes are always yellow and his teeth always more fang-like than the average human. He also now bears scars across his face which, he claims, are the result of his escape from Gilneas during the Forsaken invasion. Ulfrec was not brought to Teldrassil with the other Gileans, but escaped through Horde territory. Likely, this was through stealth. He seems to be staying somewhere in Old Town, though an actual location for his home has not been found.<br/><br/>With the onset of more "Silencer of Screams" murders in Stormwind, Ulfrec was questioned by Xytan of the Stormwind City Watch. Again, Ulfrec cooperated as best as he could be relating the story of the former murders of Gilneas City.<br/><br/>THREAT ASSESSMENT: Creepy, but harmless. Keep away from children for their mental well-being. The fact that so much is unknown about Ulfrec, however, must be rectified. Find his home!

NAME: Cleoh "The Clutch" Cannonblast<br/><br/>FAMILY: Parents (assumed deceased), seven or eight sisters (one under monitoring, see file "Molniya Cannonblast"; at least one deceased, see notes in file "Professor Tiktoffen"), cadres of nieces, nephews, and cousins. No children.<br/><br/>ACTIVITY BRIEF: Solid records for this goblin only show up after the Shattering. Prior to this period, vague records of frequent ship passages exist, none referencing the name "Cleoh Cannonblast" directly, possibly due to transcription errors from Goblin orthography. From what we can piece together out of these logs, it appears likely that she booked passage out of Kezan approximately six years ago, by way of Undermine merchanters. From Undermine, several destinations were possible; hints of her signature economic profile (buying raw gems and ores combined with selling particular cut gems and specific engineering items) appear in most major cities of both factions on both continents, and in Dalaran during the Northrend Campaign. However, reports of a goblin of her description correlating with this activity are sparse, mostly limited to neutral cities and smaller towns such as Auberdine, Menethil Harbor, K3, and Camp Mojache. Ships' records list many fewer passages under her name than would be necessary to conduct business all over the world in this fashion.<br/><br/>Interestingly, many of the merchants, especially in Alliance cities, fondly recall doing business with a draenei shaman that often went by the name "Cleio" or "Cleoh", and in the earliest reports "Clytemnestra". However, when queried they report that this draenei had a solid history and reputation that can be traced back through the Exodar to the Outlands. When independently verified, the trail checks out for the most part but goes cold in Zangarmarsh at the Draenei settlement of Telredor. Residents there who remember this period, approximately four to three years ago, recall a draenei who went by the nickname "Cly", and seemed to be reclusive, which was generally attributed by the community to a tragedy that she reportedly had recently gone through. The story involves the combined Orcish and Legion sacking of Farahlon, a draenei settlement in the region now known as Netherstorm. However, details are sparse, and very few survivors exist to verify them. <br/><br/>Going forward from the Telredor period, records of attendance and loot allotments for "Clytemnestra" and "Cleio" can be traced through mercenary guilds of moderate repute, the most recent being Outlandish Fortune. Records for this draenei abruptly terminate a few weeks prior to the Shattering. She was last seen in a tavern in Stormwind, and was presumed by the guard to have simply moved away. Guildmates support this hypothesis with vague stories, although regrettably Outlandish Fortune is not one of the organizations we have been keeping the closest tabs on.

One theory for this coincidence is that the goblin and the draenei are separate entities. However, it's not a very interesting theory. More entertaining is to suppose that Cleoh Cannonblast constructed this identity (and a very convincing illusion to go with it) over a period of several months, possibly even going to the trouble of sneaking to the Outlands and establishing a history there. The motivations for doing so are obscure; though a look through the merchants' data shows a trend away from dealing in cities run by the Steamwheedle Cartel through the first two years after her move away from Kezan, followed by an eight-month period where no signature selling occurred. It's possible that Cannonblast became involved in a vendetta of some sort and was forced out of dealing with Steamwheedle merchants, possibly violently and/or with threat of death. It is important to note that The Company has had only moderate success in penetrating the major Goblin power structures. Some data, especially that pertaining to feuds and vendettas, are not verifiable - many "records" are hearsay and many others are considered by the goblins to be too embarrassing to be discussed, let alone recorded in written records.<br/><br/>Since showing up in Orgrimmar a few weeks after the worst events of the Shattering subsided, Cleoh Cannonblast has associated primarily with the mysteriously aimless organization known as Homeland, claiming prior association with the current ringleader, Poni, and her husband Carnar. While it is possible they met in the period five to six years ago while Cannonblast was wandering the two continents, no records exist.<br/><br/>NOTES: When asked how she earned the nickname "The Clutch", Cleoh has only ever publically stated, "Oh, boy, that's a long story. Ask Carnar." Considering the reputation of this fearsome combatant, we thought it wise to go nowhere near him.<br/><br/>THREAT ASSESSMENT: Cleoh is of moderate to poor ability on the battlefield, perhaps most dangerous when channeling the elemental powers of lightning and fire, though this is mostly due to the potency of these magics and not to any great personal skill. Probably of more concern is her capacity for compassion and outspoken support of the Homeland's pacifist agenda, combined with her contacts with many merchants and auctioneers. Should she get the idea to organize economic sanctions, even against individuals, her threat level could increase considerably.<br/><br/>RECOMMENDATION: Continued surveillance.

<strong>NAME</strong>: Arlston Cross<br/><strong><br/>FAMILY HISTORY</strong>: Erstad Cross (Father, Farmer, Deceased), Jillian Cross (Mother, Housewife, Deceased)<br/><br/><strong>Personality:</strong><br/>Due to constant concealment of the face. Arlston is commonly perceived as mysterious, shady, and cold. The lack of emotion has led those unacquainted with him to find him cold and unfeeling. Pillar members and other have proven this untrue. Quoted from Pillar of Honor Vanguard, Croesan:<br/> "Arlston has feelings, I think... they're just buried deep...very deep, and just get in the way of his work"<br/>"The man doesn't smile, he doesn't laugh, the most I've ever seen, if you call guessing what's behind the mask 'seeing', he only grins."<br/><em>See side note: Croesan </em><br/><br/><strong>Activity Brief</strong>: Born in Westfall's Moonbrook, shortly before the Defias occupation. <br/>Growing up free of violence on Erstad Cross' farm, with little social experience. During the Defias occupation of Westfall, both parents were "removed" by Defias bandits. Arlston, surviving with a large abdominal wound, lost both his parents. Due to this trauma, has ceased displaying outward emotion other than extremely subtle gestures with his eyes and fingers.<br/><br/>Has since moved to Stormwind. It appears revenge is not his goal, simply avoidance of further tragedy.<br/><br/>With a fit, healthy body and prodigal mind, he joined the Stormwind Army as a common infantryman, but was quickly sent to SI:7 for covert operations training. Master Mathias Shaw took notice of Arlston's quiet and introverted personality, and his talent for detailed observation and planning. Trained to be a Stormwind Covert Personal Elimination Agent to service the good of the people, Arlston closes on his targets unseen and ends the target's life quickly and calmly, shortly thereafter vanishing and avoiding needless bloodshed. Currently on covert assignment for SI:7. Not much information known about specifics of assignment: <strong>Observation recommended.</strong><br/><br/>(<span class="underline">Recommended Triple tail as Arlston has repeatedly managed to vanish without a trace while under surveillance</span>) <br/><br/>Arlston appears to seek the company of others, but is reserved in social interactions, preferring nods and body language to spoken words. Understandably due to his secretive profession, being the the center of attention is foreign and unwelcome to him.<br/><br/>Recently spotted in Stormwind observing others discreetly from a corner and recording notes in a small black notebook. (<span class="underline">Numerous attempts to read the notebook have failed due to the contents have been written in an incomprehensible code</span>).<br/><br/>Inducted into the Pillar of Honor, Arlston acts as trusted Vanguard of the organization. Currently member of the Officer cadre and council chair. He appears to be the section chief of classified information and intelligence gathering. It can be safely assumed that all actions observed by Arlston will be cataloged and reported to other Pillars. Will also fulfill roles of selective target elimination for any the High Guard (<em>See side note: Brenri</em>) deems a threat.<br/><br/>Recently received strange letter from unknown sender: <strong>Investigation Required</strong><br/><br/>Has recently visited the Stormwind Royal Library while off duty and unarmed (supposedly): <strong>Investigation Required</strong><br/><br/>Has had meetings with Gagere, Ciellia, Cyrus, and Imperon of Lluchduu Ocheliad, but no possibility of affiliation. <br/><br/><em>See side note: Gagere</em><br/><em>See side note: Ciellia<br/>See side note: Cyrus<br/>See side note: Imperon</em><br/><em>See side note: Lluchduu Ocheliad</em><br/><br/>Has had dealings with, and appears friendly (somewhat) with the Pia Presidium's high ranking officials.<br/><br/><em>See side note: Gentyl D'amond</em><br/><em>See side note: Cray Auchtin<br/>See side note: Desmend<br/>See side note: Shauraria</em><br/><br/>(<em>Side Note: Psychiatric phenomenon</em>)<br/>Arlston is not "technically" suicidal by nature, but due to intercepted reports of SI:7 documents, he routinely volunteers for "High risk: Low survivability Missions" perhaps as a way to protect the innocents closest to harm's way.<br/>Disregard for own life, and high regard for lives of others is explanation.<br/>(Torture not recommended for information gathering purposes)<br/><br/><strong>THREAT ASSESSMENT</strong>: Negligible to Severe.<br/>Arlston is quiet, reserved and introverted. Rarely speaking his mind or displaying emotions. Due to this unreadable personality, the inner workings of his mind are unknown.<br/>Not prone to emotional outbursts or anger, he eliminates his targets quickly and without hesitation.<br/>Provided that the individual has not broken Stormwind Law or harmed innocents, Arlston is completely harmless.<br/>If the target has garnered the attention of SI:7 or the Pillar of Honor, sleeping and/or traveling alone is not recommended. Highly trained for assassination.

NAME: Temperius (no surname discovered)<br/><br/>FAMILY HISTORY: Unknown<br/><br/>ACTIVITY BRIEF:<br/>On the surface, Temperius appears to be a mere business man. He appears to be an investor in several projects on all continents. He has also assisted with various organizations in their efforts, such as the Argent Crusade and more recently the Earthen Ring.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, we have been unable to perform a deeper analysis on the individual. Every attempt to follow him has resulted in the seemingly coincidental death of each of our agents. One agent was stabbed in an apparent robbery attempt. The second agent was a victim of food poisoning, which resulted in his death (a note attached to the report states that the agent was given a stew that contained fish in it, which the agent is deathly allergic to. Investigation into the incident revealed a mix-up in the food given to the agent and another customer). The third agent's body was never recovered. As a result, we ceased efforts to directly observe the target. An attempt at long-distance scrying was unsuccessful. (A note penned in the column states that the mage who attempted it is currently under observation, and has apparently gone insane as a result of the attempt.) No further attempts are recommended.<br/><br/>THREAT ASSESSMENT:<br/>We recommend a high level of caution regarding this individual. While there is no direct evidence that he was responsible for the loss of our agents, there have been too many coincidences involving him.

NAME(S): Lady Vanressa Endran.<br/><br/>FAMILY HISTORY: Vanressa is the only living member of the Lordaeron noble house of Endran, and as such solely claims the title and holdings of her family. Her father, Lord Daventras Endran, died during the Scourge invasion, alongside her mother, Lady Nippaina Endran. Her undead brother, Brennock, finds himself one of the few forsaken to be counted amongst the Ishnu Por Ah, and is a priest of the Holy Light. Her ex-fiance, Venyn, is a warlock of Silvermoon.<br/><br/>ACTIVITY BRIEF: Vanressa came of age during the onset of the second war, at which time she was received as an apprentice by the Kirin-Tor in Dalaran under her mother, Lady Nippaina. Due to her young age and inexperience, she saw little of the war that her parents found themselves engaged in, but she did see many soldiers and mages return home as limp corpses piled on wagons. Her father was severely wounded, but not incapacitated, during the second war. The result of this early exposure to the horrors of war and the death of so many around her begun a numbing that would culminate in her profound psychological restructuring following the Scourge invasion, when she would find herself a risen member of the forsaken. <br/><br/>Her death, rebirth, loss of her entire family, disappearance of and then break-up with Venyn compounded into more emotional trauma than Vanressa could readily accept. She became cold to the world and sought out naught but revenge, which she would try to realize in helping to research the new plague to be used against Arthas. The finding of her brother and the re-emergence of Dalaran brought her some measure of closure to her pain and she slowly sought to re-establish what she could of her former life instead of trying to forge a new destiny under the banner of the Banshee Queen. <br/><br/>(continued)

(continued)<br/><br/>In this new optimistic burst of vitality, Vanressa took to exploring the world once more and was granted leadership of a new expedition, among whom was numbered Brornmagh, one of the few dwarven mages accepted into Dalaran at the time. While the necessities of the Northrend campaign ensured that much of her time would be spent in the frigid reaches of Azeroth, she readily took to exploring other parts of the world whenever possible, often meeting disappointment when she was not granted access to the great cities of the Alliance despite her association with the Kirin-Tor. Her longing for her former existence and her disinterest in the political agenda of the Horde eventually led her into the conflict with agents of her own people working in Ashenvale, which would result in her demise at the hands of an apothecary there. <br/><br/>In a seemingly miraculous twist of fate, Vanressa found herself facing true death at the feet of Elune, broken and oozing beside the gentle waters of a moonwell. Her years of study enabled her to recognize the presence of the supernatural power she was in, and reports indicate that she not only survived the events in Ashenvale, but somehow found herself restored to living humanity. Owing to her time in the void between life and death, Vanressa was somewhat connected to the spirit world and was able to make contact with a shaman, Brenri, who became the first to welcome her back into life. Finding herself starting over once again, Vanressa took Brenri's offer of fellowship and joined the Pillar of Honor. Coincidentally, this was also the time when Ehlina Vargas found herself incapacitated following recent conflicts in the Barrens. <br/><br/>With no other suitable leadership existing in the Pillar at that time, Vargas handed leadership over to Vanressa, whose father turned out to be the commander of Vargas' father during the Scourge invasion. Vanressa currently leads the Pillar of Honor, acting less as a High Guard in the tradition of Vargas, and more as a chairperson akin to the manner of leadership favored by the Kirin Tor. She finds herself in a position of importance and power despite being an almost complete unknown to many currently active in Stormwind, a fact which apparently delights her to no small end. <br/><br/>THREAT ASSESSMENT: As the head of a defunct noble house of a fallen kingdom and a middle-ranking member of the Kirin-Tor, Vanressa is something of a dowager queen clinging on to vestiges of past power and influence. She is usually a late-player to whatever events might be transpiring in her realm of concern, but has also acted strongly and unpredictably enough to turn the tides of fortune in her favor, especially given her strong emotional responses to things that she finds ridiculous and/or unjust. <br/><br/>Her time spent dedicated to the arcane arts as a single-minded forsaken has left her quite powerful in the realm of pure magical combat, and should be considered a severe threat to other spell casters, while an average threat to those employing tactics in hand to hand combat. It should be noted, however, that her respect for the danger of unfettered use of the arcane arts means that she will generally hold back in combat.

<strong>Name:</strong> Kandri Stormtree<br/><strong>Age:</strong> 143 years old<br/><br/><strong>Family:</strong> Mother (Living in Moonglade), Father (Unknown)<br/><br/><strong>History:</strong> Kandri was raised in Moonglade mostly by her mother. Throughout her child years she played amongst the trees and her respect of nature slowly grew. When given the chance she began training as a druid. During this period she learned among side of the Taurens of the Cenarion Circle and befriended many. <br/><br/>Her mother, now quite old and worn from battles of the past, still resides within Moonglade but Kandri has ventured outside of her home. After visiting Felwood, Ashenvale, and Darkshore Kandri has made her way to Stormwind City seeking a home of her own. A place where she can put her skills to use.<br/><br/><strong>Personality:</strong> Kandri is VERY cautious and quiet. Depending on the person it can take her many meetings before she gets close to you. Kandri is overly nervous around male druids, feeling she needs to prove herself at times. Once Kandri is to the point of trusting you, she'll hold you in high regard as a friend. She can be curious at times, but she has learned to not act on those feelings.<br/><br/><strong>Threat Assessment:</strong> Kandri is of little threat, until she feels she is being threatened. At which point she will defend herself.

Before the sealing of the Greymane Wall, his father, a Gilnean general who had served the Alliance and believed in its value, left for Lordaeron and gave his services to King Terenas, but asked that his son remain and keep the family line going. Daril Zherron would meet his end at Sorrow Hill at the hands of Arthas and the Scourge, fighting under Gavinrad the Dire in the Champions of Peace army.<br/><br/>Though he remained loyal to Gilneas and its people even as they were shut off from the world outside, Eidan's loyalty to his King all but evaporated once the gates sealed, knowing he would never see his father again, nor see the world beyond. So, when the powerful nobleman Darius Crowley declared rebellion against Greymane, Eidan offered his services, along with his militia force. Remaining in the hills after Crowley's capture and incarceration, he and his men would fight side-by-side with the Gilnean Royal Army when the worgen - unleashed by the magic of Arugal, at the order of Greymane himself - began rampaging across the land. Learning of Greymane's involvement made him realize that he and the other rebels had been right to oppose him. It was around this time that Eidan, touched by the old ways of the harvest mages thanks to his mother's bloodline, set aside his sword and took up druidic magic.<br/><br/>Crowley and his followers had hidden weapons, ammunition and other supplies in the houses of loyal supporters in Gilneas City. Eidan and some of his troops were sent to secure the supply cache in the house of Jeremiah August, who had been his second-in-command in the militia and in the rebellion. When he entered the basement, he was attacked and bitten by a feral worgen who had been his loyal lieutenant; screaming in agony, Eidan struck him down with a nature bolt before he slumped to the floor, and his men carried him away to his home in Greymane Court. Despite the severity of the wound and the curse running through his veins, Eidan joined the others at Light's Dawn Cathedral, where they were overwhelmed by the ferals; many who had been bitten transformed that evening, and went on a rampage. The beast that had been Eidan Zherron killed dozens who could not get away, among them his mother, his wife, and his three daughters.<br/><br/>Captured and held in Duskhaven, and administered the temporary cure created by Krennan Aranas, he declared Eidan Zherron to be dead, and in his place was "Shadowhowl" - so named for the shadow that had brought the worgen to Gilneas. As he adjusted to his newfound state and the druidic powers, now taught to him by Sister Celestine, Zherron struggled with the vague but revealing memories he had of the slaughter in Gilneas City, knowing that he had brought death to his family. But as he battled the curse and the depressive state of his thoughts, he also fought the Forsaken as they laid siege to Gilneas.<br/><br/>Zherron and his surviving militiamen, all worgen like him - including a young orphan named Amendera Kynes, whom Zherron took under his wing - battled against the 122nd Deathguard Battalion. Its leader was a Forsaken death knight, General Varan Metheius, and he was accompanied by several others - former Knights of the Ebon Blade or liberated souls from Northrend. Zherron and his militia clashed with Metheius' troops at nearly every turn, but the General himself, accompanied by his "mouthpiece" Declan Malkus and his enforcer Nyssha Swiftblade, remained elusive. After losing track of their foe, Zherron and his troops - now calling themselves the "Shadowhowl pack", with Zherron as packleader - rejoined the main body as they made their march on Gilneas City, resulting in the death of Prince Liam and the flight to Darnassus.

((Continued - and crap, I posted from the wrong character!))<br/><br/>Zherron has returned to Lordaeron several times, fighting (and escaping from) the battle in Andorhal and assisting the efforts of the Argent Crusade and the Cenarion Circle to restore northern Lordaeron to its former beauty and glory. He also made a journey to Northrend in an effort to find and help the survivors of the Wolfcult after Arugal's second death, but they had regressed too far to be saved. In recent days, he has committed himself to the war with Deathwing and the Twilight's Hammer, believing their efforts to be an affront to the balance of nature.<br/><br/><strong>Threat Assessment:</strong> Worgen are naturally dangerous opponents, but Zherron combines his natural savagery with the potent spells of those druids who favor the Balance. His only drawback is his relative inexperience, as he has only had a few months to adjust to his powers. His curse also makes him mildly reckless, but he has made efforts to temper it. The exception would be when dealing with Forsaken opponents; he is of the firm belief that nothing short of exterminating Sylvanas and her lackeys will free Lordaeron - and Gilneas - from the Forsaken's increasingly unscrupulous control.
