The Sin’dorei huntress looked at the evening sky of Ashenvale and sighed briefly before tending a small campfire. Her pet lynx was taking a nap nearby as Coriani grabbed a stack of parchment papers from her brown pack. Why was she getting out those? Simple, she needed to write letters in a plea for scrying aid since the person she originally contacted for the job ‘bailed’ out. Yes, she needed the help of mages in a plight of hers that involved a missing relative of the Arrowind House.<br/><br/>It had been months since Coriani had started searching for her cousin, Failiani and she was getting desperate. Not only was the young elf still missing, partially due to her falling for the tricks her cousin had created with fake letters to throw the huntress off the trail, she had now had strong evidence that a high elf alchemist with nefarious intentions wanted Failiani to be used in lab experiments. Nisensi…. Cori cursed as she thought of the name.<br/><br/>This high elf had recently hired experienced mercenaries to track down and capture Cori’s cousin. While she didn’t think Failiani had been located by mercenaries; it was only a matter of time before that could change. Based on what Lor'eth Dawnshadow, Fail’s guardian and others had told Coriani about her cousin’s fighting skills, she didn’t think the young one would have much of a chance against them. The huntress was doing her best to locate her cousin, however; Coriani had suffered an injury to her left ankle weeks ago that prevented her from searching on foot until it fully healed. <br/><br/>She looked at the root cast around her left ankle and sighed, it might have healed by now if she hadn’t tripped and fallen several times in the past few weeks. Using a staff to help keep her balance hadn’t helped either as one would have hoped. And she wasn’t the only one injured in the search for Failiani. Lor’eth, her cousin’s guardian had been severely injured falling off a mount in Winterspring almost a month ago. Coriani’s eyes blinked while she thought of the old rogue. <br/><br/>He apparently had found something in his search for Fail and was going send the evidence to Cori by mail. The huntress had waited for the mail and wondered why it hadn’t come until she got a letter from a druid explaining the situation nearly three weeks earlier. While he had survived his injuries from the fall, it’d take him months to recover and it was unknown at this point if he’d ever be able to walk again. As it was when she had seen the venerable elf almost two weeks ago, he couldn’t feel his toes let alone move them or his legs. That diagnosis didn’t look good for Lor’eth.<br/><br/>Her eyes blinked again. Cori had gone to Winterspring for a few reasons. One was to check up on Lor’eth and another one was to deliver an ammo order to the goblins at Everlook she had received over a week earlier. After she had delivered the ammo, she traveled to the place in Northern Winterspring where Lor’eth was recovering and find out what happened to the evidence he was suppose to send. The evidence he had acquired was a letter written by Failiani. Unfortunately for Coriani, Lor’eth couldn’t remember if he had sent the letter to Ratchet, Gadgetzan or Silvermoon city.<br/><br/>Speaking of letters, Cori shook her head and cursed silently after she accidently dropped the parchment papers into the fire; her clumsiness wasn’t helping in this matter as she started to look for more parchment in her packs. Granted, she should have written and sent the letters over a month ago but finding out about Lor’eth’s injures and the ammo order had greatly distracted her at the time. The ammo order had been finished and delivered and she figured she’d have the time to write them now with her pet taking a nap.<br/><br/>That is if she could she parchment paper to write the letters, the red haired Sin’dorei thought she had more somewhere in her bags. The huntress shook her head and started, she couldn’t write a plea to ask for help if there wasn’t anything to write on. Luckily, she found enough parchments papers to write with a few minutes later in the same pack where she also found her Bloodthistle. She wasn’t sure how the papers ended up where they did but at least she had some, even if the parchments had the scent of Bloodthistle on them.<br/><br/>((continued below))

With the papers in hand, who was writing to? Coriani had asked Sidonwy, a member of the Da Doctas in a letter for recommendations in scrying and after meeting with the Sin’dorei, she had got three names. Yes, she was going to write letters to three different mages. The first one was going to Professor Vernim Wormwood, a forsaken mage associated with the Da Doctas. Coriani sighed before getting out a quill and writing down the note which read;<br/><br/><blockquote>To Professor Vernim Wormwood, <br/><br/>I’ve heard that you study the history of arcane magic and I’m hoping you can help me out in a desperate plight of the Arrowind House that would require scrying. Sidonwy recommended your name after I told her of my dire situation. And trust me, it is dire.<br/><br/>I can explain the situation. My young cousin and only known relative that still a Sin’dorei alive has gone missing. Failiani Arrowind ran away from Silvermoon some time ago and while I’ve been looking for her for months now, I haven’t been able to find her due to setbacks and recently suffered an injury that’ll set me back from searching on foot until it heals. <br/><br/>To make matters worse, I’ve come across evidence that high elf alchemist by the name of Nisensi wants to capture my cousin and use her in vile experiments. This high elf wishes to create potions that would kill blood elves slowly and painfully without it affecting other races. She has even hired experienced mercenaries to track down and capture my cousin. I’ve been told my cousin’s fighting skills are that of a student so I don’t believe she could successfully defend herself against such a threat. <br/><br/>I’m desperate to find Failiani before any harm can come upon her. At this point, I believe the only way to find her in a timely manner is scrying. If you can spare the time to help, I would be grateful. I’ve would even be willing to pay if that mattered.<br/><br/>~Coriani Arrowind</blockquote><br/><br/>((continued below))

Happy with the letter, she carefully folded the parchment and put it next to her. The next letter Coriani had to write was going to be addressed to Vanyris Spellsong, a magister in Silvermoon City. She hadn’t heard of this particular magister before but then again Coriani didn’t pay attention to politics in that place for reasons she wasn’t about to go into now. No, she just needed to get this letter written quickly so she could get writing on the last one;<br/><br/><blockquote>To Magister Vanyris Spellsong,<br/><br/>I hope this letter isn’t interrupting any important business and my apologizes if it does. Sidonwy told me that you had scried for her once before and she recommended your name after I told her of my predicament. I’m writing to ask if you can provide aid in an Arrowind House plight.<br/><br/>The plight that I requesting aid for would require scrying and is related to my cousin, Failiani Arrowind. She hasn’t reached adulthood and decided to run away from Silvermoon some time ago for unknown reasons. I’ve been searching on my own for my cousin since her venerable guardian told me months ago and haven’t been much successful. A little while ago, I got an injury that’ll set me back from searching for her until it fully heals and Failiani’s guardian has been severely injured in a fall and won’t be able to help me out.<br/><br/>I found evidence from a journal that I obtained that my cousin’s life is in significant danger from Nisensi, a high elf alchemist I thought had died before the first war. She wants to capture a Sin’dorei child to be… used in lab experiments to test various potions that she seems to think will kill blood elves slowly and painfully without it affecting any other race including Quel’dorei. This blasted high elf has decided that my young cousin would be the child target of her experiments. <br/><br/>Before I got my injury, I ran into a goblin that works for the Nisensi who informed me that she has recently hired mercenaries to track down and capture Failiani. With this evidence in mind, I’m desperate to find my cousin soon before she gets harmed; either by mercenaries or Nisensi. I don’t want to lose my only relative, especially to a blasted high elf. <br/><br/>I understand with Magister duties that you may not have the time to perform the tasks but if you do and can provide any assistance to a fellow Sin’dorei in this matter; I would be indebted, even if I have to pay.<br/><br/>~Coriani Arrowind</blockquote><br/><br/>((continued below))

She again carefully folded the parchment and placed it near the first letter before starting to work on the last note. Who was it going to? Coriani was addressing it to Archmagus Raoul Zharikov, a forsaken who was fond of tea and illusions from what she was told. This letter was a bit different in that Cori wouldn’t mention Sidonwy’s name in it due to request. Which was fine in her mind, she would use the name of the mage who had bailed on her if the person asked for one. She sighed before starting to write again;<br/><br/><blockquote>To Archmagus Raoul Zharikov,<br/><br/>I’ve heard from others, including a novice mage ex-relative of mine that you are an expert in scrying matters. If this is true, I could desperately use someone like you to help in a dire plight. My young cousin and only known living relative that is still a blood elf, Failiani Arrowind ran away from Silvermoon City and has been missing for some time. I have been trying able to locate her on my own for many months now and haven’t been successful, due to injuries and tricks. <br/><br/>It may not dire but I assure you it is. I’ve come across strong evidence that my cousin’s life is in jeopardy. A high elf alchemist with nefarious intentions wants to capture my cousin and use her in various lad experiments to create potions that would… kill blood elves painfully without affecting other races including high elves I might add. Nisensi, the high elf that is after Failiani seems to have forgotten the common origins of Quel’dorei and Sin’dorei and seems to think they are a physically different race now.<br/><br/>Nisensi has even hired experienced mercenaries to track down and capture Failiani. I’ve been told by others that my cousin isn’t capable of defending herself against a threat. I’m currently injured and can’t search on foot for her until it heals. I fear that if I don’t get scrying help to locate Fail soon… I’m desperate to find her before mercenaries or Nisensi do and inflict her with serious harm.<br/><br/>If you can spare the time to help in this dire matter, I would be most grateful. I’m even willing to pay if that is required.<br/><br/>~Coriani Arrowind</blockquote><br/><br/>She placed this letter next to the others and wiped her eyes. She hoped one of these mages would be able to help her in the search for Fail. She didn’t know how she could find her cousin without getting help of some kind. With the notes done, how was she going to mail them especially if she wasn’t near any mailboxes? Simple, she had a portable one in her toolbox. Granted, it did take a few minutes to power on but once on, it’d mail anything she could fit into it such as letters and Bloodthistle pedals. <br/><br/>The huntress quickly got out the portable mailbox from her toolbox and set the device up and waited for it to power up. She briefly looked up at the sky and noted a few clouds were above while grabbing the letters. A small beep and the scurrying of a squirrel startled due to the sound of the device told her that the portable mailbox was ready to send. Cori put the parchments into the box one at a time and waited until a ding noise went off before repeating with the others until the letters were sent. She put the device away a few minutes later, wondering how long they’d take to reach the places.<br/><br/>((continued below))

Now that the letters had been mailed off, Coriani decided to turn her attention to TigerCat and attempt to wake him by petting his fur; they really needed to get going. She hadn’t mentioned where she currently was in Ashenvale and all she could say on that matter she wasn’t exactly safe by any means. The huntress was several miles away from a night elf retreat in fact, not safe from Alliance patrol at all. Even though she may have considered herself neutral, others may not see that way and with her being injured, she didn’t feel like having a confrontation with Night Elves.<br/><br/>Coriani shook her head as she still attempted to wake her pet minutes later. Normally TigerCat would wake up with a few pets on his fur if the small amount of noise she made didn’t make him stir first and it worried her. Granted, her pet was still alive as he was warm and breathing but something about this sleep, she knew by now it wasn’t the normal little nap he normally would take, something was causing to last this long. What could he had to cause this? The only thing he had was mountain trout she had bought a few hours earlier from a blue haired goblin… had been tainted with something? <br/><br/>There was only one way to find out. Coriani shook her head while painfully standing to her feet before her hands took on a faint green glow. The huntress did know a thing or two about mending her pets with spells (<strong>only her pets</strong>, she knew she wasn’t capable of just healing any animal out there in the wilderness or any other hunter's pet for that matter), she could mend some injuries and dispel magic effects to a point. <br/><br/>Cori of course couldn’t dispel powerful magical effects, poisons or curses from her pets; that required an actual healer to perform that. She couldn't mend grievous injuries with ease, in fact she couldn't at all without risking passing out unconscious and the pet's injuries not mending. That thought brought a brief flashback of a previous pet to the Sin'dorei.<br/><br/>She sighed carefully as she examined the lynx; hopefully no Alliance patrols would show up while she was doing this. Even if she wasn’t injured, the Sin'dorei wasn’t strong enough to lift her pet into Flying Machine and leave. Hopefully whatever was wrong with her pet was something she was able to mend quickly so they could get going. Coriani didn’t want any confrontations after all.<br/><br/>((I apologize for taking so long to post the IC letters, my health is still poor. I may post this on the CC.org forums at a later time.This thread is related to another one, <em>The hunt is on</em> but it's taking me longer than expected to gets all the post done in it. Feel free to respond in this one until I can get it updated to to the point of this thread which will take a while due to health. <br/><br/>To the mages Cori has written letters to, feel free to take as long as you wish to respond. If you don't wish to partake in this, that's fine too. ))

Looking over a report of some kind, the Warden sat quietly against the wall of one of the cavernous barrow dens in Ashenvale. This one had been converted to a makeshift command center, with maps strewn across the only table, and racks of weapons and armor lining the walls. <br/><br/>She looked up from the report, noticing three night elves huddled around one of the tables and looking to one of the maps. She stood up and approached, holding the page of the report with her thumb as she brought it over.<br/><br/>"Shyllyssa, before you plan this attack further, you may not have as much work as you think. Ms. Fay's analysis of the recovered ledger shows that the mill was purchased with borrowed funds with some pretty steep penalties for default, and that the shredders are all leased..."<br/><br/>"I'm sorry if I'm not as <em>worldly</em> as you are, Warden." The commander cut in condescendingly, "But if you could just tell me what your quill-pushing highborne filth told you this time, without reading six pages of goblin-speak, I would appreciate it."<br/><br/>"Just burn down the lumber mill. That's all you need to do to get them out of that camp."<br/><br/>"Now wasn't that easier?" The commander sniped. "Hm... I suppose I'll take that under consideration, but then, I don't exactly believe in pinprick warfare."<br/><br/>"Commander, your force is made mostly of replacements! If you attack that camp, you'll win, but at a tremendous cost. Just give me an incendiary, and I'll have the problem taken care of."<br/><br/>The commander shook her head. "I'm not going to watch the Horde just walk those shredders off to another camp. You can set the mill afire, sure - I took your advice under consideration, but I'm not going to just let the Horde scurry away to start anew. As for your concern over the losses you expect me to take - do not forget, Warden, that I have overseen more successful engagements than you have seen period." She spat, continuing with a venomous tone. "I don't have the luxury of leaving Ashenvale to go wipe the outlanders' noses in Darnassus... or slap people on the wrist for things that things that they should be imprisoned for."<br/><br/>Kyalin narrowed her eyes, turning away as she didn't want to get into a visible confrontation with the commander. Shyllyssa called her back though. "Oh, and warden? Before you go back to do that..."<br/><br/>"What is it?" The Warden replied - keeping her tone flat.<br/><br/>"We found an injured blood elf near one of our retreats.... and her lynx."<br/><br/>Kyalin turned to face the commander again, ruffling her cloak. "Then why didn't you just shoot her?"<br/><br/>"The area smelled of Bloodthistle... I know you've been chasing that fox for... how many months now? I understand you've still failed to stop the smuggling."<br/><br/>"Jurisdictional issues with..."<br/><br/>"Excuses are all I hear." The commander interrupted.<br/><br/>The Warden ruffled her cloak again, the cracks in her calm expression already starting to become apparent. "You're talking about something you admitted you don't understand. So if you'd be so kind, keep your nose out of it, and when I want your opinion I'll ask for it. This is probably just some thistlehead - not a courier or a dealer."<br/><br/>"Shall I give the order to shoot then?"<br/><br/>Kyalin had already started to make her way out when she heard the question. She paused for a moment. "No, I'll go retrieve her. Just tell the patrols in the area to do a thorough sweep. It could be a trap."<br/><br/>((If you want me involved at least, I'd be willing to play the other side of this. Perhaps we could get some people from both sides and make an RP-PVP event out of it. We'll have to get in touch soon. My horde alt's name is Sihung.))

((It's fine with me if you want to get involved Kyalin. We can get in touch about the details. (I'd assume the patrol is stealth out of sight. I will say I'm hesitant on getting into an actual World PVP battle on Cori due to past bad experiences on her. PVP for others to get involved with is fine with me.) If I'm online, it's usually late day/night PDT though I could try to log on in the afternoon. My horde alts are Coriani, Failiani and Qixilixa. <br/><br/>If anyone else wants to get involved in this RP, that's fine with me. There seemed to be mail waiting for Cori when I briefly logged on her. I'll read it and respond to it a bit later. I plan on making another post but will talk to those involved before getting it up.))

<blockquote> Miss Coriani Arrowind, <br/><br/>I am indeed rather skilled in the multiple arts of divination, from scrying to psychometry. I admit, part of my curiosity compels me to inquire as to why she ran away from home in the first place, though you're free to divulge as much or as little of that as you are so inclined to.<br/><br/>It sounds as if this high elf is indeed rather delusional, most likely having been convinced of such by Alliance propaganda, as have the Silver Covenant as of late. An unfortunate state of things, as the Alliance seem to consider them little more than cannon fodder to throw at their enemies, similar to certain other individuals in power these days.<br/><br/>Are you aware of any further details in regards to the mercenaries? Knowing their identities could prove useful, in one way another. In either case, no payment is required, however, a few things will need to be provided in order for me to properly locate her - this world and the rest are not small places, after all, and 'searching blind,' so to speak, when I've never met her, would be quite the undertaking. <br/><br/>With that in mind, I will need either some or all of a number of things, based on what you can provide. A vial of her blood would be wonderful, but as I imagine you don't have that on hand, we can make do with a vial of yours, if you're willing. Considering she is your last living Sin'dorei relative, the fact that she is merely a cousin rather than an immediate relative shouldn't dilute the results too much, though it may be a weak trace. <br/><br/>Beyond blood, if you have any objects that belong to her or were once owned by her, they would also prove quite helpful in narrowing down the results and finding her, wherever she may be. Anything with some form of attachment to her, be it physical or emotional, will do as well. Furthermore, if you have any idea as to the general area she may be in, that can also do well to narrow the search down, though if not, either the blood or objects will do well enough.<br/><br/>I wish you well in your search, and will offer a timely response should I hear back from you after this one. <br/><br/>-Archmagus Raoul Zharikov</blockquote>

Miss Coriani Arrowind,<br/><br/>While I myself am quite adept in multiple schools of Arcane Arts and Sciences, I do not proclaim myself to be a master of scrying. I do however still wish to aid your plight that you have written to me of. However on the particular matter of scrying I would recomend my colleague, Magister Raoul Zharikov.<br/><br/>In terms of aiding your struggle, I wish to offer you access to a rather large network of colleagues and contacts that spans most of the Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor, as well as parts of the Outlands as well. Unfortunately this network has yet to spread to Northrend or the newly re-discovered land of Pandaria.<br/><br/>Amid this network you will find alchemists in the Ashenvale, enchanters in Feralas and the Outlands, Scribes in the Tirisfal Glades, and many other services spread throughout the greater continents. <br/><br/>I would prefer to cover these details in a face-to-face meeting; location of your choosing. Fear not however, and rest assured that my contacts were established through a most reputable career in the Arcane mostly devoid of any unsavory business.<br/><br/>-----Professor Vernim Wormwood<br/><br/>((I am available the following times.))<br/>Mon-Thurs: 1:30pm-5pm<br/>Fri-Sat: Noon until whenever<br/>Sun: Noon until 5pm

Cori was in a state of panic. Her pet lynx, TigerCat had been asleep for over a day and still hadn’t awakened. She was certain from examining him earlier that it was a magical effect from a potion or something similar and it was too powerful of one for her to have a chance of dispelling with her mending spells. Either a healer would be needed to dispel the effect or she was going to have to wait it out and see if it dissipated on its own. The latter being something the huntress didn’t want to do considering where she had landed.<br/><br/>How had her pet managed to get affected by a powerful magical effect? Simple, it was from the mountain trout she had bought for him from a blue haired female goblin salesman’s near the border of Felwood. She had taken another look at the fish and noticed it had turned a dark brown color from the green color it had been before. Not only had it turned a different color, it also had an alchemy type smell to it. The trout now was sealed up in a container as she was wanted to keep it as evidence for warning others from buying anything from the goblin tradesman. <br/><br/>The blue haired goblin (Cori forgot to get the salesman’s name) that had sold her the trout didn’t appear to be an alchemist type or a fisherman but she could have been wrong about that. Then again that goblin had mentioned they had a ‘reputable source’ for the fish. Coriani figured she was going to have to track down the goblin tradesman and find out who had given them the fish. Whoever had tainted the trout was extremely skilled with alchemy and a danger to others considering her pet’s state.<br/><br/>The huntress’s thoughts got interrupted as she heard something hit her flying machine. What could that been? She knew it wasn’t an arrow or bullet based on the sound but it wasn’t a moth, either. She winced as she got to her feet and inspected the area briefly before noticing what seemed to be a paper airplane lying on the ground next to her camouflaged covered flying machine. Where had it come from? The elf didn’t see anyone else nearby thankfully but the paper airplane probably had magical properties that made it travel far distances. She better go investigate it.<br/><br/>She winced while she gingerly walked over to her machine and pick up the paper airplane before sitting down near the sleeping lynx. After inspecting the paper, Cori noted it even had a message written on it that was addressed to her. Who had written this note? That did bother Coriani that someone had managed to track her down to this part of Ashenvale but considering the way the message had come, it had to be important and needed to be read right away.<br/><br/>With that in mind, she started to read the note on the paper airplane, her face paling a bit after she had fully read it. According to the note, her life was now in grave danger due to her being in Ashenvale and an unpleasant woman intended to find out the reasons Coriani had come though means she wouldn’t want to experience. That meant torture for the huntress and no; she didn’t want to experience that. The huntress had been held prisoner before a few years earlier by Sin’dorei rogue she wasn’t to name at the moment and was lucky to survive that incident. She didn’t want to get herself in a similar situation again.<br/><br/>That being said, who was the person after Cori? Were they someone in the Alliance, in the Horde or was this someone Nisensi? Why Coriani had just thought of the wretched high elf’s name, she wasn’t sure but it did occur to her that there was the chance that alchemist could decide to go after her, too. It also wouldn’t surprise her if this person was Alliance considering she had landed near a night elf retreat. There could be patrols spying on her now…<br/><br/>The thought of Alliance patrols spying on her right now alone made her shiver. If they or someone else were to attack her, she wasn’t in the best position to defend. Her greatest strength was in her pets and only one she had brought with her right now was in a deep sleep. Three of her pets were in the stables of Silvermoon city while her Saltspray gull was the stables of Thunder Bluff; hopefully it was minding the Tauren and not dropping rocks on objects and persons while she was gone. <br/><br/>She still had the root cast on her left ankle which would make defending herself more difficult. Even if she wasn’t injured, there was the issue with her weapons. Cori tended to break her crossbows often outside of a battle due to her clumsiness and occasionally forget to repair them. Granted, she didn’t have to worry about a broken weapon right now due to her receiving a new wooden crossbow from someone in Pandaria as a gift a few months earlier that she kept in good shape. However, she didn’t know how it would fare in an actual battle since she had only fire it a few times against a wooden target dummy.<br/><br/>((Continued below.))

A wooden target dummy wasn’t the same as something living that could dodge an arrow with ease. With her pet down and her being injured, she knew she was going to need help with dealing with this danger. She may consider herself neutral but that didn’t mean she was going to let herself be simply taken prisoner by anyone, Alliance or anyone else with nefarious intentions. <br/><br/>Coriani read the paper airplane message again and noticed it said to contact Inquisitor Liore Bloodwing as soon as when she was able to. Granted, she needed to do another quick check-up on TigerCat to make sure he wasn’t getting worse but once done with that, she’d be able to get a quick message to the Inquisitor and possibly find out the source of the danger against her.<br/><br/>With that thought in mind, she checked on her lynx just to make sure it wasn’t getting any worse. A few minutes later, the elf grabbed the portable mailbox out of her bags and set it up for it to warm up after noting her pet was stable in his sleep. Coriani quickly got out a quill and one of the parchments papers( that may or not had the faint scent of Bloodthistle on it) out of her pack and quickly wrote out a note for the Inquisitor that read; <br/><br/><blockquote>To Inquisitor Liore Bloodwing,<br/><br/>I was informed to contact you as soon as I was able to. What type of danger? Is it from Alliance or someone else? <br/><br/>Either way, I will need aid if this is the case. I’m injured and my pet lynx is asleep due to powerful magical effect. <br/>I’m not going to abandon my pet either lest danger find him.<br/><br/>I know time is a factor here; I did make the mistake of landing near a Night Elf retreat. My ability to defend will be limited with my pet down. <br/><br/>~From Coriani </blockquote> <br/><br/>She folded the parchment paper note as neat as she could before placing it in the mailbox. After a hearing a beep that it had been sent, Coriani put the portable mailbox away before deciding to find something in her packs to eat. She did need to keep her strength up in order to be able to tend to her pet and such. That being said, she didn’t want to have to cook anything such as her root vegetables that would take time given the location she was at. The less noise she could make the better.<br/><br/>The huntress was content to find some mushrooms in a smaller pack that wouldn’t require any cooking and decided to eat a few of the bigger ones along with a petal of Bloodthistle as her meal. After she finished eating, she decided to lie down to relax for a bit as she feeling a bit exhausted. That didn’t last long as her ears twitched at the sound of something rustling in the bush nearby. Something was in it and it didn’t seem to be critter by the sounds of it.<br/><br/>She got onto her feet and decided to check the bush as quietly as she could. That being on the challenging side with the root cast around her left ankle and such. Once she got to the bush, she was surprised to find a paper airplane message; in fact it seemed to be created with the parchment paper she had just sent to the Inquisitor. Interesting, it seems her note hadn’t taken long to reach them at all. Good in her mind considering the circumstances she was under.<br/><br/>Coriani nearly tripped (luckily she didn’t fall) while she walked back over to where she had been sitting before. Once seated, the elf decided to read the note on the airplane, nearly groaning out loud after it was read. The danger against her was due to a warden; Cori didn’t like the roguish types. Even if her pet was awake she would have difficulty fighting against one, especially if the rumors the elf had heard about them were true. The last thing she wanted was to be constantly being pursued by a warden until in their custody and be subjected to… torture and who knows what else by them. <br/><br/>Thankfully, the inquisitor mentioned in the message that he was going to send agents to keep a perimeter around her. Granted, she wouldn’t be able to see such agents but if they were able to keep the warden’s forces at bay while she tended to her pet, that’s all that mattered to her. <br/><br/>And tending to her pet is what she needed to do as she noticed TigerCat starting to shiver. Great… she quickly got out a blanket and put it over him in an attempt to keep him warm and muttered a few of her mending spells. Granted, she needed to get another note out to Inquisitor Liore Bloodwing but that would have to wait. Her pet needed more aid at the moment.<br/><br/>((This is part of the posts, some of this is from what has happened in-game already; I can edit the posts if the parties involved want me to. I do have more incoming that'll have IC letter responses but that'll take me more time to get up.<br/><br/>That's fine Kyalin (my other character has the potential to cause trouble concerning Bloodthistle). I'm probably going to try to get Cori out of Ashenvale soonish due to her pet's state. I'm starting to feel under the weather though it'll have to be later.))

((Figure I'll give a reason))<br/><br/>"You're sure about this, Verronia?"<br/><br/>The highborne nodded, pointing to a specific set of entries in the ledger. "Positive. These amounts are just too high for that sort of pelt - not in the standard quantities shipped. It's Nightsaber, no doubt."<br/><br/>"I'm still surprised that you managed to get it. You say they were keeping three sets of books, but they still gave it to you?"<br/><br/>Verronia shrugged. "All a matter of who you ask."<br/><br/>The Warden nodded, taking a sip of the rice wine she cradled in her hand. "Tell them that you need to do another round of confirmations tomorrow. We'll raid the branch early in the evening. Are we making any progress overseas by the way? When can we get this stupid nightsaber hat issue behind us?"<br/><br/>Verronia nodded, flipping a few pages. "The 'justice fund' made some commodities purchases and did a little bit of informal marketing. It was a risk, but we were able to sell off some lynx pelts that a few shady dealers in the Dwarven district were peddling earlier... and a nice profit I'll add... but the elites are starting to see Lynx-pelt hats as more exclusive, which has led to a spike in demand."<br/><br/>"I thought you said that... nevermind... it will be good to take the pressure off at least and give it to those bastards... maybe the Goblins will stop trading in Bloodthistle... ah if only..."<br/><br/>Verronia looked down for a moment. "About that..."<br/><br/>"Hm?"<br/><br/>"One of the scrying runes... you know... back when we were tagging Sin'dorei peasants? One of them came back with some information. Apparently someone knows about the courier. I don't know who yet, but evidently, they're planning on stopping you. Probably a trap."<br/><br/>Shaking her head, the warden finished her glass and set it down on Verronia's desk. "We have a leak then..."<br/><br/>"I've noticed some Worgen hanging around the bank... they may have grabbed a few records and..."<br/><br/>"Si Hung Ton... his old contacts are still feeding him information.... it's the only way."<br/><br/>The highborne accountant tapped her fingers on the ledger. "Another bloody raid?"<br/><br/>"Another bloody raid" Kyalin repeated, nodding. "Not before the branch though. You get them that information as soon as possible."

The blood elf sat down in a small shelter made of branches and leaves exhausted and a bit cold before taking a brief glance at the sleeping lynx next to her. She had been stuck near the night elf retreat in Ashenvale well over a week (over two weeks but the huntress hadn’t keeping exact track of time) now and TigerCat hadn’t woken up. That panicked the huntress; granted, he was somehow still alive due to her mending spells seemed and possibly the potion’s effects could be keeping him stable, too but Coriani was worried her pet could deteriorate before long. She was near her limit of being able to care for him.<br/><br/>Her lynx’s health wasn’t the only thing on her mind, either. There was still an issue with the irritable warden; Coriani didn’t want to end up in their possession. Thankfully, Inquisitor said they had sent agents to set a perimeter around her that she wouldn’t be able to see. Those invisible agents seem to be going a good job keeping the warden’s forces as she hadn’t seen any Alliance patrols around. Then again something could have distracted the warden’s attention, too. Either way, Cori was glad that she hadn’t had any confrontations.<br/><br/>Still, the huntress wasn’t sure on when she would be able to get out; this stop had lasted way longer than intended. It was supposed to have a last a few hours at most; not a few weeks. Coriani needed to get to Ratchet and find out if that was the location Lor’eth had sent the letter he had acquired in the search for her cousin. Hopefully it was there; otherwise the huntress would have to go to Gadgetzan or even Silvermoon City for the evidence.<br/><br/>That was once she was out of Ashenvale. Cori had a sent a note to Inquisitor Liore Bloodwing asking for aid in getting out of Ashenvale two to five days earlier. A few hours later after the huntress had tended to her pet, she had received a response telling her to hunker down for at least two nights and stay alive before sending an agent to get her out. She had enough supplies to last easily another week but… hopefully she’d be out of danger before the supplies had chance to run dry.<br/><br/>Once she was safely out of Ashenvale, she could then meet with the mages had received the letters from and get help in the search for Failiani. The huntress hadn’t had been able to write the letters yet to Archmagus Raoul Zharikov and Professor Vernim Wormwood due to her getting distracted with taking care of TigerCat and building a shelter while trying not to make her injury worse. He had needed more care when he had started shivering many days earlier. Thankfully the lynx’s shivering had started to lessen last night.<br/><br/>((continued below))

There was time to write the letters now the more the huntress thought about it as she got out three parchment papers from her pack. She could briefly write quick letters to the mages and write a note to a member of the Da Doctas before doing another check up on her pet. She quickly got a quill and started to write the first letter (addressed to Raoul Zharikov) on lightly scented Bloodthistle parchment that read; <br/><br/><blockquote>Greetings Archmagus Raoul Zharikov,<br/><br/>I apologize for taking this long to write this letter. I have gotten myself into a situation by landing in Alliance territory in what was supposed to be a quick stop to feed a pet and now am currently stranded. That being said, someone has been made aware of my current status and will send an agent to get me out. I should be back in horde territory soon enough and will be able to meet with you wherever it is convenient. <br/><br/>I don’t have a vial of Failiani’s blood but I can get you one of mine along with a few of my cousin’s valuable possessions that I obtained. I also have a few letters that are in her handwriting if that would help.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I don’t know the identities of the mercenaries that are after my cousin but I presume them to be of the Alliance races based on propaganda Nisensi has deluded herself into. I only have guesses as to why my cousin decided to run away but she could be trying to strike out on her own or attempting to follow in her late father’s footsteps in becoming a pirate.<br/><br/>I can discuss more of my cousin’s situation whenever we can meet. Fare you well until then.<br/><br/>~Coriani Arrowind</blockquote><br/><br/>((continued below))
