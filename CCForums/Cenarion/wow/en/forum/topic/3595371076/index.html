It was something she had to do....the ache of her loss and her guilt would not let her heal. So long ago it seemed...a simple mission of vague importance. Who could have known it would turn out this way. The gentle glide of the gryphon as it winged over the pristine mountains of Dun Morogh seemed peaceful. Looking down on the valley full of snow and tall pine trees, Jaszmin Shadowstar lost herself in the memories. <br/><br/>It was a long flight to Light's Hope, it would take her several days of flight and rest. Her gryphon could only go so far before it required rest. The first night she landed in Loch Modan. The dwarven city bustled with miners and brewmasters. The devastation Deathwing left was hard on the dwarves. They worked hard to restore the lake and the peaceful mountain meadows for their crops of hops and and other staples of dwarven diet.<br/><br/>The inn was noisy and full of drunken dwarves, she only stopped for a hot meal before heading out to camp in the hills. She needed peace and solitude. Several of the cinnamon haired dwarves tried to cheer her up. "Wha's wron' Lass? Ya lul like ya lost yer bes' frien'?"<br/><br/>It was hard not to tear up with that, Jazzy only nodded and replied softly, "I have lost more than one...though I go now to say good bye to one who is gone forever. And to ask for forgiveness for a mistake I made..." <br/><br/>The kindly dwarf shook his head, "Ya kinna brin' him back, lass...tis the way of life...let it go...live fer today...he will unnerstan'" his broad calloused hand patted hers in sympathy.<br/><br/>Jazzy smiled in gratitude and shook her head. "I did something I should not have done...I lied to him...I thought the reason was valid at the time...now there is no way...." she swallowed the lump in her throat, unable to go on.<br/><br/>"Lass...where is he now? Do ya know?" the kindly dwarf asked with tears of his own in sympathy with her.<br/><br/>Jazzy shook her head. "I think maybe in or around Silvermoon City...he was Sindorei...I will look at every graveyard until I find his final resting place...and pay my final respects...and ask for his forgiveness." her voice strained as she made her own personal vow.<br/><br/>"Sindorei! Lass, he was an enemy...I am sure he kilt plenty of Alliance....how kin ya fall fer..." he stopped at the glare in her eyes.<br/><br/>"He was a friend...and he loved me...he was not a typical blood elf...he was honorable and kind...witty and brave...not to mention...very handsome." her voice was tremulous. She looked around at the shocked faces and bowed her head, wiping the tears away. She stood up and ran out the door.<br/><br/>The night air was cool as it usually was in the mountains. Jazzy rode her gryphon up into a quiet glade and made a small camp. Sitting by the fire she gazed into the flames for several hours unable to sleep. Remembering....<br/><br/>Dancing eyes of emerald green and blond soft silky hair. A smooth face with sensuous lips and a dancers body, supple and slim...but well muscled and tan. A voice that filled her dreams with his laugh and his wit. Gentle hands, calloused but smooth, sending her into such sweet bliss with his touch.<br/><br/>The moon was well up and lighting the night sky when she finally rolled into her sleeping bag. This was a journey she had to make alone. And she needed rest for her mind and soul.<br/><br/>(day 1 of the journey after learning of his death)

(day 2- several days after her last encounter with Ashok Longshadow, who had murdered her lost love Dalen - sorry posted on my alt Lori(sheepish grin))<br/><br/>The dawn seemed to come too early for Jazzy as she rolled out of her sleeping bag. Stretching and yawning she made a light breakfast and called to her gryphon. The black bird/beast had already eaten his fill of fish as Jazzy cleaned up camp and packed the saddle.<br/><br/>Climbing on board she urged the gryphon into the sky. They were soon soaring over the wetlands and she remembered to look for ore as she flew over the tin rich land. She lost her desire to make things lately and put it down to her general soul sickness. She had to close this portion of her life before she could find enough peace to continue.<br/><br/>The renewal of the wetlands continued as the druids worked at healing the lands. Deathwing had struck herre as well, and Twilight's Hammer were creeping in from the east. Jazzy avoided the eastern edge of the land and concentrated on getting to Arathi where she would spend her next night.<br/><br/>There were times when Jazzy almost regretted the long lives of Kaldorei. On one hand you got to do some amazing things, like explore the world and find new people to meet. But there were also drawbacks...like falling in love with a short lived race..humans could be so handsome and passionate...and so fickle...<br/><br/>The miles melted away as she drew closer to the Arathi Highlands. The rolling green hills hid treasures of iron and mithril, Jazzy had spent many months mining for them. The kobolds guarded their little caves with ferocious fervor.<br/><br/>The torches of Refuge Pointe guided her to the camp and she landed safely. The captain begged for her aid in fighting off some trolls who were harrassing the camp. Most of the camp's staff were guards who were stretched thin with fighting the encroaching orcs and Forsaken.<br/><br/>Jazzy agreed for a price and went to work. It would take her mind off of Dalen, if only for a short time. She stealthed into the rolling hills and found a group of trolls heading for the refuge. Her poisoned blades made short work of them and she turned back to camp. Carrying the tusks she had cut off as proof, she was almost there when she heard a cry of pain. Melting into the shadows she crept forward to investigate.<br/><br/>As she came over a short rise, she found a blood elf female fighting for her life with a group of raptors. The young girl fought bravely and held her own, but was having trouble with three raptors. Jazzy shook her head and went to help. The poor girl was frightened of the Kaldorei and as soon as she could disengage from the raptors she tried to flee.<br/><br/>"Wait...I need a favor...for a favor..." Jazzy called out in fluid thalassian. It was one of the languages she had learned as her work with SI:7. The girl stopped and turned, curious as to the motives of a Kaldorei. "I will not hurt you...please come and share my camp...I need help in finding...a grave..." her voice soothing and calm to allay the girls fears.<br/><br/>They spent the evening talking and getting to know one another , and Jazzy was happy to have found a friend. The gal was named Lilli and was merely gathering herbs, she was not a spy as far as Jazzy could tell. As Jazzy told her the story, Lilli cried tears of sympathy.

The dawn found the friends still taking about lost loves. It seemed Lilli has had her share of them. All Lilli can remember is a vague tale about some ranger captain named Dalen Firehawk having been lost in Ashenvale. It was a tavern tale and she did not know how true it was, only that he had disappeared there. Jazzy ponders this information and thanks Lilli.<br/><br/>After getting a couple hours of sleep, Jazzy decides to head back to Refuge point. The commander is thankful for her help with the trolls and pays her well. "You need to get some sleep girl...you look like death warmed over..." his voice kind as she hands her a sack of gold.<br/><br/>"I think I will head to the other side of the fighting...I hear they need help in Ashenvale..." she says quietly. Her mind drifts off to memories of Darnassus and home. It has been a long time.<br/><br/>"Take care and set sail from Stormwind on a nice cruise, it will help you to rest..no good fighting tired..." he smiles at her.<br/><br/>Jazzy smiles back and heads for the gryphon waiting for her. The flight is long and she lands in Stormwind before darkness settles again. Her steps to her small apartment in the city are slow as she is almost asleep on her feet.<br/><br/>Settling in for the night, Jazzy dreams of Dalen, his voice haunts her and she wakes a few times in the night crying. The cat on her bed stretches and yawns as Jazzy sits up. "This is no good, I have to find peace...." her hands stroke the calico cat as she thinks of a plan.<br/><br/>Throwing off the covers, Jazzy dresses in comfortable leather armor and sets out for the harbor. Her steps are light as she resolves going to Ashenvale will help her to set this part of her past to rest.<br/><br/>The sun is at noon before the ship is ready to sail and Jazzy relaxes at the rail as she watches the sea fill her line of vision. The trip takes a few days and Jazzy will rest well in the belly of the ship.

The mists of Teldrassil and the docks come into view as Jazzy stood at the rail. It had been a long time since she had been home. The devastation of Deathwing had touched even here. Emotion touched her heart as she walked off the ship and headed for the Hippogryph master. Darnassus seemed to be changed slightly and then she noticed a lot of the worgen walking around. She had not known many, though she counted Grishmak as a close friend.<br/><br/>Their ways were close to the humans, with the raw exception of the curse. Jazzy did not envy the worgen. Their lives had been forever changed and it was partly due to the intervention of the Night elves in the wars of the past.<br/><br/> Jazzy smiled and greeted old friends, happy to see her home again. Jazzy went to her family abode and spent a good part of the day reminiscing with her sister Wulfsong, and cousin Kaevelara. Wulfsong had shared some of her stories of lost love as well, the three of them seemed to share a propensity for sadness.<br/><br/>Wulfsong noticed Jazzy's pensive attitude, "What is it sister? What has brought you to this side of the world? I sense a different aura, one of guilt as well as sadness." her discerning eyes missed nothing.<br/><br/>Jazzy shifted uncomfortably and then began. "I have made a terrible mistake...I seek to ask for his forgiveness...though it is too late to do so in this life...perhaps I can beg his spirit...I only want to put this to rest...to gain peace in this life. As much as I can..." her eyes fill with tears and she brushes them away.<br/><br/>"What did you do? And why is it too late? Surely you don't mean...oh...you do..." Kae blushed at her unthinking remarks and put an arm around Jazzy. "I am sorry..go ahead, tell us what happened." her voice calming.<br/><br/>The memories came back to Jazzy with startling clarity as she recalled the days in Uldum and a neutral tavern in the desert. "I cannot tell you all of it...some is still classified...I was on assignment to find out what was going on in Uldum...there were some relics involved. The place was called Sam's Bar and Grill. It was also a fancy gambling den...I went in as a singer...hired by Sam. It was actually a rather fun assignment. I did not realize how much I loved singing until I spent time there." her voice wistful.<br/><br/>Wulfsong grinned and shook her head, "You were always a songbird...you could charm the eagles and foxes with your voice..." her tone affectionate. "So what happened there? Did you meet someone?"<br/><br/>Jazzy nodded slowly, "He was Sindorei, a gambler and a ranger...handsome and charming...I...was...not prepared to lose my heart..." her words faltered as she recalled his handsome face once more. "He was a tough elf, with keen reflexes and sharp eyes. We sparred and taunted each other with jokes and innuendo...he seemed to think I was just a singer...until I pulled out my daggers..." she smirked at the memory.<br/><br/>Kae rolled her eyes, "And so you beat him to a pulp? And stole his heart in the process?" her eyes twinkling. She had done much the same to some over zealous suitors.<br/><br/>Jazzy grinned, "I could never beat him, he was very good...perhaps it was fate...something...threw us together." her thoughts turned back time and she recalled how much fun she had with Dalen.<br/><br/>Her memories also brought back the pain of loss, "I had to do something...to keep him from fighting a dear friend of his...Ashok Longshadow..." her voice trailed off.<br/><br/>Wulfsong gasped, "So it is true? Ashok was a traitor even then?" she had only heard rumors of the great hero, some good and some bad.<br/><br/>Jazzy looked up startled, "NO! I do not think of him as a traitor...he was sent to prevent the horde from taking a very important relic. Oh I am saying too much...but I will say this. After all this time as friends, Ashok ended up much later...as the one...who killed...Dalen...though I only found out later it was Dalen who had attacked first...because of the things that happened in Kalimdor with one of Dalen's kin."<br/><br/>Wulf and Kae looked confused, "What did you do to Dalen that you had to leave him?"<br/><br/>Jazzy looked down in embarassment. "I told him I had to leave for family obligations, that he was better off without me...he accepted it with much sorrow...we spent one last night together...and then the battle was over for the relic and...then...I left...never to see him alive again..." tears fell freely as she sobbed on Kae's shoulder.<br/><br/>"What family obligations...oh...you lied...to keep him out of the battle...but why didn't you go back and tell him? Surely he would have understood? Upset maybe..but " Kae was just trying to make sense of it all.<br/><br/>Still trying to wipe her eyes, Jazzy shook her head, "I did not want to admit to him that I lied..selfish ...foolish pride...I never stopped loving him...and now it is too late... I just want to say good bye and ask forgiveness...I have to find his final resting place somewhere in Ashenvale.

After a troubled night trying to sleep, Jazzy gets up to the birds singing and the peaceful tranquillity of Darnassus. Stretching and yawning, she looks for breakfast and finds Kae siting in the little kitchen with a plate of fresh baked cinnamon rolls.<br/><br/>Her eyes twinkle and she offers Jazzy a roll and then pours juice for her. "Eat well, Jazzy. Ashenvale is harsh right now, the Horde is trying to take over the forests...they are everywhere." her voice is concerned as she hands the glass of juice to Jazzy.<br/><br/>"I know, I have been trying to pay attention to the news reports and bulletins. Somewhere in Ashenvale there is a gravesite...I mean to find it if it is the last thing I do. I am tired of the war and the politics. I may go live in Outland...plenty to do there, and it is not so hectic." she spoke quietly but with conviction.<br/><br/>Kae knew she would not be able to talk Jazzy out of this. "Elune light your path..you must do what you need to do to put your soul at ease." patting Jazz's hand and sighing in sadness.<br/><br/>"Thank you Kae, I will go now before it gets too late to catch the flight to Darkshore." getting up and setting her glass on the counter. Jazzy walked quickly through the door and made her way to the flight master. The hippogryphs were noisy and called out in their trilling voices.<br/><br/>The flight to Darkshore was rather quick and Jazzy soon found herself in the new village of Lor'danel. The many missing townfolk were mourned and Jazzy had time to visit her old friends. The graves were simple and bound to the nature loving Kaldorei. Decorated with flowers and simple gifts of food, which the birds and bugs would feast on in the name of the departed.<br/><br/>Jazzy wondered what kinds of things the Sindorei did to honor their dead. She would have time to look she figured, hoping it would not take too much time to find the gravesite. She retrieved her saber Ghost and set off for the south.<br/><br/>The forests of Darkshire held their secret paths and Jazzy knew many of them. She wanted to avoid the regular trails and simply head south. The animals are scattered and confused, Jazzy has a hard time finding a path that is not torn up from the release of the elementals. Her saber is patient though and the find a path near the ocean and follow it south until they have passed the Blackfathom Deeps.<br/><br/>The naga still roam the strand and she is hard pressed to work around them. finally the path is clear and she heads for a secluded glade to make camp for the night. The sounds of the forest are familiar to Jazzy, the birds and the insects do not bother her as she sets up a simple camp.<br/><br/>The firelight flickers and dances in the still night. Jazzy has lost any hope for finding a reason to go on with her life. Her training and skills are not useful for a normal life. She digs in her pack and pulls out an old lute she found in the wreckage of Auberdine. She has no idea whose it was, but she attempts to fix the strings and bring it into some semblance of tune. It is something to do...and her fingers work on the instrument and finally she is strumming it in a gentle melody.<br/><br/>Her clear sweet voice lifts mournfully into the night, simple syllables and no words are clear..she simply pours out her misery in the gentle notes. No one is ther to hear her...she is truly alone.

The night air is still as the moon arises. As Jazzy lifts her voice a wolf joins in from the forest and soon more join in. They seem content to just circle around her and sing, not coming close enough to threaten her or the saber who lays by her side.<br/><br/>Jazzy strums for a while until finally she is weary enough to put the lute away and curl up against the nightsaber and sleep. Her dreams are gentle and peaceful memories of the times she spent in Ahsenvale growing up. The nightsaber purrs as he cuddles around her and keeps her warm.<br/><br/>Dawn filters through the trees several hours later, painting the sky a rosy pink. The giant cat gets up and stretches, going into the forest to find some food while Jazzy slumbers on. Her dreams before she wakes are getting closer to reality as she recalls the Moonkin and the possibility of danger in these once pristine forests.<br/><br/>The leaves stir with a slight breeze as she finally awakens, stretching and yawning. The fire has gone out and Jazzy decides to eat a cold breakfast and continue her search. As she munches on trail food the nightsaber returns. He is sated and ready to travel, and soon they are on their way.<br/><br/>The sound of screams and fighting alerts Jazzy to possible trouble. Going into the shadows she works her way off the side of the trail and moves forward. There is fighting over Astronar and she cannot go past it without stopping to fight. Stealthing up to a siege machine she makes short work of the orc who is trying to blast the city.<br/><br/>She moves on and takes out another seige machine before the silence of the artillary alerts sentrys and they start hunting her. Jazzy revels in sneaking and taking out stragglers on the Horde encampment outskirts. A fellow rogue joins her and she smiles as she recognises someone she knew long ago. Together they manage to disable more than half of the artillary hitting Astronar.<br/><br/>Working in concert, the pair of rogues manage to take out the Horde commander and the operation falls apart. Sentinels from Astronar arrive and put an end to the fighting, rounding up the orcs and trolls and even a blood elf who is the last to be captured. He bears a striking resemblance to Dalen, though his blond hair is long and luxurious flowing down his back.<br/><br/>They take the prisoners to a camp and put them in cages. The head Sentinel tries to question the orcs, but they refuse to cooperate. Jazzy relaxes in the camp and as things settle down she sits and gazes at the cage containing the blood elf.

The day is almost done and Jazzy decides to stay in Astranar for the night. As she walks past the cage containing the blood elf, he reaches out to her pleading in broken common, "Please,...not a spy...help please..." he tries desparately to get her attention and she stops.<br/><br/>In Thalassian, Jazzy talks quietly to him, "What is your name? Where are you from?" her eyes search his and she is startled at his resemblance to someone she holds in her heart. The same emerald eyes and blond hair, though it flows down his back in straight and smooth strands.<br/><br/>He gazes at her a moment in astonishment, "You speak my language...oh! I am Therinor Sunwalker, I am a scholar, a mere student of arcane, I am just here searching for herbs for my alchemy experiments. I am not a spy...I got caught in the crossfire...please tell them I am not an enemy...I swear it on the Sunwell!"<br/><br/>Jazzy raises a brow, her voice low as she considers his request. "And how am I to know you speak the truth? I do believe I saw you flinging some spells around...you are not that innocent.." she smirks at the thought he can fool her.<br/><br/>"Please believe me, I am only trying to defend myself...I didn't even hit anyone..at least not seriously...can you help me please? I will do anything to prove it to you...just give me a chance..." his voice is full of desparation, and his eyes are on the edge of tears.<br/><br/>As he speaks, the Captain of the sentinels walks up, "So you decided to talk? Hello Jaszmin, it's been a long time, glad to see you here. You made short work of those orcs on the ballista." she turns to the blood elf and sneers. "Don't think we believe you mage...I have at least four sentinels complaining of frostburns and you are the only mage in the group. And yes I also seak the language of the Sindorei, it's part of my training."<br/><br/>Therinor sighs and rests his forehead on the bars of the cage, "I suppose I did fight a little, but only in self defence...I have a right to defend myself! Your sentinels attacked me when I was merely gathering herbs...ask them!.. if they tell the truth...I am not any danger to anyone..." he pleads with the Captain.<br/><br/>Jazzy turns aside, not wanting to get involved, it is not her place to undermine the Captain. "I have things to do Captain, I need to find a hidden gravesite...hopefully today or tomorrow." she glances up at the sun going down and shrugs.<br/><br/>"A gravesite? Whose grave is it and why?" the Captain is very curious. She has seen many unmarked graves and usually they are of little significance, except to those who loved the one who was lost.<br/><br/>Jazzy hesitates, the war between Horde and Alliance has been going on for a long time, but her friendship with Dalen would be looked at with frowns and disapproval. It is one of the reasons she let him go...knowing he deserved a better life than one spent in hiding and shame. "An...old friend...I need to say good bye...I did not get a chance to...tell him...the lie I told eats at my soul...I seek forgiveness..." her voice soft and sad.<br/><br/>The Captain quirks a brow and turns back to the prisoner, "So...you are so innocent...tell me something I need to know...why are the Horde attacking Astranar? Why can't they content themselves with what they have? They have no right to destroy the forests!"<br/><br/>Therinor sighs deeply, "I wish I knew..actually I wish they would just go back to Draenor...they smell awful and speak such gibberish it makes my head spin...I want no part of this war..there are more important things to think about...like a giant black dragon!" He gazes at Jazzy a moment and his eyes get thoughtful. "I think I remember seeing a gravesite near the border to the Barrens...if you let me out I can take you there..I will be your prisoner...just get me out of here...I can prove I am not an enemy...please.."<br/><br/>Jazzy looks at the Captain, "Do you mind if I take custody of this one? I can return him later if he proves himself a liar...he won't get far I promise...and if he is telling the truth it will help me a great deal."<br/><br/>The captain shrugs, "If you want to take the chance...you do outrank me Jaszmin...very well..I leave him in your custody then..." she reaches out with a key and unlocks the cage. Before she lets him out however she holds out a titanium enchanted bracelet, "Give me your hand Therinor, this will inhibit your magic...gives you nothing more to cast than a simple candle flame of magic."<br/><br/>Therinor holds out his right hand and the bracelet is attached. "I suppose that means I am at your mercy then...Jaszmin..." he bows in rrespect. "Thank you..."<br/><br/>The captain hands Jazzy the key to the bracelet. "Good luck to you then, come back when you can, I doubt the Horde will leave us alone for long."

The earnest green eyes of the Sindorei are starting to get on her nerves and Jazzy turns away. "We...ah...need to get going...where is this gravesite?" her voice cracking slightly as she tries to be calm.<br/><br/>"You must have really loved him a lot...to be noble enough to give him his freedom..." Therinor moved to her side and looked down at the bracelet with annoyance. "It is off the trail a bit, in the area near the Warsong Lumber Camp." the mage remembers finding the secluded spot and wondering why it was there.<br/><br/>The breeze lifted her purple hair and swung it across her face. Jazzy brushed it aside and turned away to avoid looking at Therinor. "It was not noble..it was a lie...I did not want to leave him...I just...knew he would....go through a lot...but he had his whole life ahead of him to do great things for the world...I did not want to keep him from that...." her voice falters and she feels the tears on the edge of her vision.<br/><br/>The great cat yawned and stretched as it looked at Therinor's hawkstrider, an interested gleam in his eyes. "No you don't...we need to keep this one safe..." Jazzy settled on the back of the night saber and motioned for Therinor to go ahead. "We will follow you...don't get any funny ideas...we will see how you do and if you run...I will not hesitate to kill you...understand?" her eyes now cold as she got her emotions under control.<br/><br/>Therinor nodded and settled on his mount and turned down the trail ahead of Jazzy. "I will show you the site and then we can come back here if you wish...or maybe let me go?" his eyes are serious and yet there is a look of teasing there as well.<br/><br/>Smirking once at his tone, Jazzy nods, "We will see...if it is the right grave..." her saber following close behind him. The ride is peaceful as they make their way towards the eastern edge of the forest of Ashenvale.<br/><br/>The ruins of some of the past Elven temples are a stark remeinder of her past. As they rode Jazzy looked ahead and a thought crossed her mind. "Therinor...how do the Sindorei revere the ones who have passed? Is there anything I can do to...honor the grave? To show my respect for his...your..culture?"<br/><br/>The hawkstrider was irritated as the night saber stalked behind him. His feathers were fluffed out and he walked stiffly, making squawking sounds. Therinor tried to calm his mount and managed partially as he though about Jazzy's words. "Flowers are nice...maybe a plant or two from Silvermoon, though all I have are a few seeds from my herbalism studies...you can have them if you wish..." he was touched by her concern for tradition and looked back with a smile.<br/><br/>The nightsaber walked behind the hawkstrider with his tail swishing from side to side...his ears alert and every sense was poised to strike. It was no wonder the hawkstrider was nervous. Jazzy patted him and sighed...there was no way she could keep the animal so calm if he was hungry. "Dismount for a bit, Therinor...I need to let the cat hunt and sate his hunger or you will not have any hope of keeping yours calm."<br/><br/>Therinor stopped the strider and looked back nervously as the cat licked his lips. He dismounted and the hawkstrider squawked in indignation as he eyed the saber. Jazzy dismounted and pointed to the forest and a small glade off the trail. "We can rest there and the cat can hunt...might as well have a snack as well." <br/><br/>There was only a short time before dark and Jazzy looked around the small glade. "Shall we camp here? It appears safe..." she could barely see the road from the screen of trees around them. The cat took off and hunted, a silent killer as he slunk off through the trees.<br/><br/>"Looks fine to me...you should rest...I can make us some food..." his hands busy as he tried to cast some spell for mana biscuits. The bracelet however had other ideas and his spell fizzled. "Maybe not...oh well...I am not going anywhere..." he resigned himself to helping Jazzy set up the camp. The rocks around a small pit indicated this place had been used before. He gathered some wood and started to make a fire, while Jazzy watched with amusement.<br/><br/>"We leave at dawn...so let's eat and give the mounts time to rest." she pulled out some trail rations and handed a piece to Therinor. He gave up trying to start a fire and took the bread, sitting on the ground and gazing at Jazzy.

It was full dark when the nightsaber came back, but he did not give a second glance to the hawkstrider. Therinor had finally managed to get a fire going and was feeding it twigs and smaller branches. "So...uh...Jazzy...I heard a little bit about what happened when you spoke to the Captain....I understand you want closure...if this friend of yours...Dalen...is gone...you know there is nothing you can do to bring him back...right?" his voice seemed on edge.<br/><br/>The fire crackled and popped, Jazzy sat with her back to a rock and gazed off into the forest, watching the moon come up. "I know that Therinor, I am just a simple Kaldorei, not a magic user or priest...it is my dilema...my past that haunts me...I will never have a family or settle down...I am not free to do that...I made a vow long ago...I must hold to my vow...no matter how hard it is now..." her voice trailed off as she sipped the last of her tea.<br/><br/>Therinor gazed at the beautiful elf, not able to take his mind off of her. He was sensitive enough to feel her sorrow, and wanted to help, but he did not know how. He watched the moon coming up and could see the light touching her hair in shimmering highlights. He broke sticks into tiny twigs and tossed them on the fire, watching them warm and ignite. "Jazzy...you are not alone...there are others with broken hearts...they share your pain..." he tried desparately to reach out to her...his hands would not move except to break the wood into tiny pieces.<br/><br/>Jazzy turned slightly and a soft smile crossed her face. "No matter how many hearts are broken, Therinor...all must face the pain alone... the only peace to be found is inside..." she looked at the pile of kindling and shook her head.<br/><br/>"You are so restless...you should get some rest...dawn comes sooner than we want sometimes...how close are we? To the gravesite?" she turned to look at him.<br/><br/>The craziest thoughts crossed his mind as he looked into her violet eyes. "Not far actually...perhaps half a days journey...I think...I have not been this way in awhile...sleep...yes...you trust me to stay here I hope...I promise not to run away..." his eyes held more than that promise, and he looked away quickly afraid he had given himself away.<br/><br/>The fleeting look was not lost on Jazzy and she turned away and sighed. Why she always got these males chasing after her she did not know. She did not consider herself beautiful, in fact she did not even think of her looks. What attracted her to a man was his confidence and appreciation of her other talents...not the obvious ones.<br/><br/> Thinking she would nip this in the bud before he got any more strange thoughts, Jazzy turned to him with a serious glint in her eyes. "I am not going to warn you more than once...the cat is a trained saber...he will hunt you down if I tell him and there will be nothing left...do you understand?" <br/><br/>His eyes wide, Therinor nodded and turned to his bedroll and wrapped up in it and lay down next to the fire. It was a long time before he fell asleep.<br/><br/>Jazzy lay down next to the saber and fell asleep a short time later.

The day did not start well, clouds had drifted in and it was damp and drizzly. Jazzy woke up to the tree above her dripping coldwater onto her face. Sighing with resignation she looked over to see Therinor sitting up and rubbing his eyes. He had awoken about the same time and turned to smile at her. "Good morning to you...it looks like a wet day...good thing we do not have far to go." he was trying to be cheerful.<br/><br/>Nodding in agreement, Jazzy started the fire up with some dry kindling she had under her pack. She made tea and they had some more trail bread. Getting closer to her goal was not making it any easier. Thoughts of what she would do now that she had a prisoner, kept her from making any comments.<br/><br/>The mage cleared his throat, "I know you have your problems...I guess we all do...but for what it is worth...I am sick of the war and would much rather make friends than enemies." he looked at her hopefully.<br/><br/>The packs were on the saddles and Jazzy mounted up before she turned to him and pointed to the road. "Let's go...I want to get this over so I can get on with my life..." was all she said.<br/><br/>Therinor mounted his hawkstrider and proceeded down the trail. He turned to smile at her and shrugged when she was not even looking at him. Her head turned down the other way as she kept alert for enemies. He racked his brain trying to figure a way to gain her trust. The trail took a turn and he could see an orc patrol ahead coming straight for them. This was his chance...he turned to warn her and was surprised to see no one behind him.<br/><br/>He looked around in confusion...she had been right behind him...he turned back in time to see the orcs wave and pull up beside him. Their wolves panted and sniffed around as the orc captain paused, "Are you lost Sindorei? The Warsong camp is just ahead, just keep going on down the trail...you cannot miss it." his voice gruff and businesslike.<br/><br/>Therinor smiled and laughed at the orc, "Ah no, I am not lost...I am looking for herbs and I distinctly remember finding some magebloom here in the forest, but I will find it...no need for you to bother yourselves...carry on and thanks for stopping." he moved off down the trail slowly making a point to wander off the trail a bit to find some magebloom.<br/><br/>The orcs, shrugged and laughed at him and continued on down the road. Therinor got off the strider and looked around. He bent to pick the magebloom and thought to himself she was right there somewhere...she was a rogue after all...she must be watching him...<br/><br/>He waited for an hour and she still had not appeared. He got back on the strider and headed for where he knew the gravesite was. He moved slowly and carefully listening for any sound in the woods around him. He went off the trail and found the small clearing where he had found the simple grave. There was no one there. <br/><br/>He sighed as the rain started up in earnest and thought for a few moments while the strider squawked in protest. He reached into his pocket to find the seeds he had determined to give to Jazzy today. To his shock, the seeds were gone...but in their place was a small key. He stared at it and could not figure out where it had come from.<br/><br/>The rain pattered down and he was definutely getting wet now. He got back on the Strider and headed back to the main road. He was just in time to find the orc patrol on their way back to the lumber camp. The orcs laughed at him again, "Come to the camp and get dry...you look like a drowned rat..." and his hawkstrider evidently decided it was a good idea because he followed them and he soon found himself inside the main building of the camp.<br/><br/>His thoughts were in a turmoil...where had Jazzy gone...he looked at the magic nulling bracelet on his arm and suddenly noticed the small keyhole in the lock. He nearly smacked himself in the head as he dug out the key and inserted it into the tiny lock. The snick of the lock freeing him was a relief.<br/><br/>Therinor put the bracelet and the key in his pack...and sat down at a window and watched the rain pour down.

The shadows shifted as the heavily cloaked rogue watched the Sindorei ride away. The rain was heavy and continued to pour down for another few hours, not letting up until almost dark. Jazzy got up finally from under the tree where she had taken shelter.<br/><br/>The clouds were scuttling across the sky, chasing the stars as they winked through the wisps. The water running off the ground into the river nearby made a musical sound. The soggy undergrowth did not make much sound as she made her way to the gravesite. As she knelt to brush away the weeds and overgrowth covering the crude wooden slab, the moon broke through the clouds. Only to disappear again before she could make anything out of the scratchings on the slab.<br/><br/>A knot in her throat and the blur of her tearful eyes made it hard to concentrate. On one hand she was afraid to see the name on the marker. But part of her needed to know. It was too dark to read it, and everything was too wet to light a fire. Frustrated she sat back and leaned on a tree next to the grave.<br/><br/>Words were swirling in her head and she could not drive them away...the lies...the love....the wasted life...all the haunting memories..she could do nothing to stop the flow of tears and frustrated thoughts. The light from the rising moon teased and taunted her, whispers from the breeze seemed to condemn her and her wasted life.<br/><br/>The pack on the ground contained all that was important to her at the moment. She reached for it and pulled out the lute she had found in Auberdine. Even without much light she could strum the battered instrument. Plucking the strings and strumming an ancient melody. Finally her voice rose above the whispering wind and she poured her heart out in a simple song.<br/><br/>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zochPeuCI5Q

Clouds still drifted across the sky as Jazzy sang...the moon finally broke through and shone down in the grave. The gleam of the wood plague attached to a stake in the ground was readable now. Jazzy sat a short distance away leaning against the tree, her face turned to the moon as it slowly filtered through the clouds.<br/><br/>Jazzy's voice trailed off...her fingers still lightly strummed the lute...her mind filled with confusing thoughts. Was this it...was this the end of her journey? Slowly she stood up and walked to the grave...as the words crudely scratched into the wood plaque came into view her vision blurred...she knelt to the ground and wiped the tears from her eyes.<br/><br/>Her fingers traced each letter..<br/><br/>{Here lies Dalen Firehawk. Friend, and true brother in arms}<br/><br/>A knot grew in her throat...so painful she could hardly swallow...a sob shook her frame...she bent down and covered her face in her hands...he was ....really .... gone....her tears fell through her fingers and onto the ground....mixing with the rain...<br/><br/>Many hours later she still sat curled in misery, her arms wrapped around her legs, her head resting on her knees. She ached all over from crying. The soft breeze lifted her hair and whispered in the trees. The sun was just beginning to color the horizon to the east. The nightsaber was curled beside her offering the only comfort he could offer, his silent acceptance.<br/><br/>The ache of the night before was still on her as Jazzy felt into her pocket and found the small sack of seeds she had pulled from Therinor's pocket. Taking her dagger she dug into the soft soil over the grave and cleared a patch around the marker, pulling weeds and grass out by the roots. "I am sorry to disturb you...my love...I am too late to say I am sorry...for causing you pain...too late to ask forgiveness...too late to say....I still love you..." she whispered as she worked.<br/><br/>Finally the soil was ready and Jazzy scattered the seeds over the fine dirt and lightly covered them. The soil was still quite damp and the seeds would take soon she knew. She sat back and patted the dirt down. Her mind was numb with the aching loss.<br/><br/>What now? Her mind refused to respond...she sat and watched the sun come up. Birds sang and bugs clicked and jumped in the grass. The saber got up and stretched as he moved off to hunt.

A new day...still Jazzy sat next to the grave. Her heart was numb, there was only emptiness where once she had sung with joy and life. Her eyes were dry, her fingers loose as she held the dagger in her hand.<br/><br/>Part of her wished this moment for a dozen Horde to come out of the woods and wipe her memory from the face of the earth. There was no desire to go home, there was only sad memories and an empty life waiting for her there.<br/><br/>Her life had been a storm and volcano for so long...no stability...no lasting love or children to pass her skills onto. The choices she had made were born of immediate need and survival. There was never any time to plan for the future and the peace she had fought for with all her heart for so long.<br/><br/>The snap of a twig brought her up and clutching her dagger, listening to where the sound had come from. She faded into the shadows at the base of the tree, moving softly away from the grave and into the cover of the brush. The thumping of her heart sounded loud to her ears, even if she was the only one who heard it.<br/><br/>The sound never came again and Jazzy suddenly realized she could not give up her natural instinct for survival. It was part of who she was...this was her life and she was the only one capable of living it in her own unique way.<br/><br/>She moved off into the quiet forest. searching until she found a small cave near a stream. The inside was dry and of a suitable size. She would stay here now and probably live out her life as a sort of hermit. She could live off the land and have her peace. The settlements not far away would have her help when she felt like it, and her trade when she needed it.<br/><br/>She would mine and sell the ore to buy supplies. Only coming out when she absolutely had to. This, she realized, would be a peace she needed to calm and comfort her soul. Tending the gravesite would be a daily duty. She set about clearing the cave of rubble and spent the rest of the day at peace for the first time in many years.
