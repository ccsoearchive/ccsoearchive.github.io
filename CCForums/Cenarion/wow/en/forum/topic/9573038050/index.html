Letters had been sent, and Ares found himself a mailman out of nowhere. Usually, it was Eve who handled his business, but this was something that he would oversee personally. The assassin had became unusually quiet during the preceding days, but now he was present, for he had delivered Shadow’s request for a meeting to the Silvers and their response. The letters appeared to have been delivered with seals unbroken, and yet the man found it curious enough to sit in on whatever was going on now. <br/><br/>Shadow came in through the tavern doors as she always did, bright and energetic and ready to go, even if there was nowhere to go. To his amusement, her eyes trailed over those present, to the black-haired female human at the bar who was fixing up a drink, up until her eyes ended on Ares. There was a momentary pause, as he silently wondered if she was beginning to expand her senses and as she considered him thoughtfully. As if she might ask him a question, and yet was too afraid, or too ashamed to do so.<br/><br/>“Silver!” she turned instead to look at the humans, switching to Common for simplicity’s sake. It sounded almost as fluid as her Thalassian. “How are things?”<br/><br/>“What?” the hunter looked up, deciding to simply !@#$ with the monks.<br/><br/>“Eh?” Silver asked as he popped up from behind the bar, just his head anyway. There was a loud cracking sound as if Silver were tinkering with something. Rath had walked in behind Shadow and let her lead as he took in the tavern, he didn’t want to know what Silver was working on at the moment and the way they answered Shadow told him that something was about to happen. He focused in on Ares and wondered what the assassin had been up to but didn’t think it kosher to ask. He kept to himself, and Selethen, those two seemingly inseparable of late.<br/><br/>He wondered then where the other assassin was.<br/><br/>“How are things?” the younger monk giggled, amused by the fact that both of them had answered. How strange it was that they shared the same name. <br/><br/>“Peachy, %^-*ing... peachy!” the dark-haired human answered as she pulled herself up to sit on the edge of the bar. Though, it wasn’t, not by the sound of her tone. “If it was any peachier, we would be on a peach farm in the middle of peach season!” she then paused and looked down at her lover. “When is peach season, anyway?”<br/><br/>“We can make peach beer?” Shadow looked back up at Ratheron for confirmation on a peach-based alcoholic drink. She then shook her head and looked back at the scant few at the tavern. “Actually, I was wondering a few things, but they can wait. What’s up?”<br/><br/>Ares shrugged nonchalantly and leaned back in his seat, his gaze focused on Ratheron in return. The man had been scarce around the Fellowship, for they weren’t his group, nor were they his people. He didn’t want or need the connections, though by the sound of what Shadow was wondering, he openly sighed. Perhaps he could guess what was on the monk’s mind, his eyes drifting suspiciously to Silver. The last time they had tried to do anything, the woman had spiked his drink. <br/><br/>((1/4))

“Beer is icky. Gimme some damn good whiskey!” Silver chirped as he ducked back down under the bar and the sounds of tinkering continued. “As to when peach season is, !@#$ if I know! I ain’t no damn farmer!” He yelled over the sounds and Ratheron shook his head. These people were very interesting. <br/><br/>“I can do a peach beer if you want darling.” He murmured to Shadow as he moved to stand near the bar to survey the Tavern, it looked cleaner than he remembered. It also looked like Silver had spent some time renovating and doing work on it.<br/><br/>“Upgrading things?” He asked of the female Silver.<br/><br/>“Kinda sorta,” she replied with a grin. “Peach whiskey!” she called. It had to be done, now. But like hell if she would be the one to drink it. “My boy Entreri here will be the one to test it. Won’t you, darlin’!” the woman seemed to drawl Entreri’s accent back at him, as if mocking him. Shadow giggled again.<br/><br/>“Maybe because more people are coming around, hm?” Shadow offered with a smile. “Something I wouldn’t mind doing again. Maybe sometime soon? Maybe with more people than just your friends and the Firehawks?” her smile grew a bit wider. The woman had many a family, and she had to wonder if the bar would still be standing once she threw the Fellowship into the mix. <br/><br/>“Ooo,” Demon crooned with a wide grin, her blue-green eyes nearly shining. “Who’s coming to town?”<br/><br/>“Maybe the Fellowship,” Shadow replied, and the hunter had to lean back a bit, looking thoughtful. <br/><br/>Silver poked his head back up over the bar and turned to look at Ratheron, “Ya cool with it?” the elf merely shrugged.<br/><br/>“It would be good for us to get some relaxation and the last time we threw a party it went well.” Ratheron said with a slight smile and Silver chuckled.<br/><br/>“%^-*. Two assassins butt !@#$in’ rest of us singin’ an’ %^-*. Tai an’ Varus fightin’. Damn good party if’n yer askin’ me!” He said excitedly, “When ya wanna throw it?” He asked of Shadow now as he sunk back below the bar.<br/><br/>“Rhannah and Rian couldn’t believe it when I said that you sang!” Shadow widened her eyes, as if hurt that someone would call her a liar. Demon looked between the two elves before she burst out laughing.<br/><br/>“Tall, dark, and serious. Of course no one would believe he did. But, it was music hour and a song from everyone was mandatory!”<br/><br/>“Uhm,” Shadow looked over the side of the bar down at Silver as he worked, trying to catch a glimpse of what he was doing. “Whenever works best for you guys. If you’re busy, maybe in a few days?” <br/><br/>Ares simply closed his eyes, not commenting. Denying or confirming what Entreri had said would only cause a stir. It would have been a waste of energy, so he simply remained impassive, not letting anyone barb him into a reaction. His eyes opened soon enough as he looked at the stairs leading to the bedrooms on the first floor where Silver had come after him with daggers. Hopefully this party wouldn’t be so expensive on his coin purse in terms of insurance.<br/><br/>“Who’s paying this time?” the assassin wondered idly. If need be, he would. No one, not even Selethen, knew how deep his pockets were. No one needed to know, as far as he was concerned.<br/><br/>((2/4))

“I am.” A voice said from the doorway and Silver perked up at the voice, peering out to see that Ashok was standing in the doorway, framed by the light coming from the outside and given a very foreboding look.<br/><br/>“Damn man ya lookin’ mighty scary!” Silver said with a bit of a chuckle as he stood up, setting his tools on the bar as he wiped his hands on a rag he had. “As fer timin’ this !@#$, we got a few more renovations an’ repairs to make. Then it’ll be set fer a big event like this. So give us ‘bout a week, week an’ a half.” He said to Shadow as Ashok came to the bar and nodded at everyone.<br/><br/>“I’ll be paying for it all, the fact you beat me to paying for the last one didn’t go unnoticed Ares.” Ashok said with a slight grin, it was obvious he had a bit of a generous streak. Ratheron had to chuckle, how did he have that kind of money? But it was probably better to not ask.<br/><br/>“Hi, Ashok!” Shadow perked up, not looking intimidated at all by the man’s dramatic entrance. She turned and nodded to Silver. “Week and a half it is. No reason to rush anything. It’ll give me time to figure out who’s up for this and who to invite so everyone’s schedules are clear!” she chuckled, thinking of a few of the more reserved people who she would wish to see attend.<br/><br/>“What can I say?” Ares replied in a level tone. “You were just slow to the punch last time. Could have beaten you to this one too,” he didn’t rise to greet anyone, remaining sitting in his corner. Some would say brooding, but he had something on his mind, something that he needed to work through on his own time.<br/><br/>Ashok merely smiled a bit at Ares’ jab, but he didn’t choose to fire any back as he relaxed at the bar. Silver was still tinkering beneath the bar and suddenly he started swearing like a drunken sailor. “Son o’ a %^-*!! @#$%! ^-*!! @#$%^s! Bah!” Was all that could be heard before the sounds of more tinkering were heard.<br/><br/>“You alright down there my friend?” Ashok asked, raising his eyebrow as he looked over at Demon and wondered if she knew what he was doing down there. Ratheron had raised his eyebrow as well but he wasn’t looking at Demon, he was wondering what the hell was going on with Silver and his eyes were continuing to zero in on where the bounty hunter kept popping up from.<br/><br/>Demon laughed softly, “Don’t worry about it!”<br/><br/>“Are you sure?” Shadow looked doubtful as she looked around the room. <br/><br/>“Naturally. With Silver working on it, it’ll either work, explode, or both!” she laughed even louder.<br/><br/>“That reminds me. Like I said last time, I think Ratheron should provide some drink this time,” Shadow leaned forward, trying to see what Silver was doing, far more curious than concerned about any impending explosions.<br/><br/>“Tha’d be good! This thing’ll need some good brews on tap!” Silver said as he continued to work, a spluttering sound following his words and Ratheron raised his eyebrows. “On tap? Whatever do you mean?” He asked, curious as well now to know what the devil Silver was working on.<br/><br/>“Its a machine tha’ll tap a keg an’ let us keep it cooled till we want to get a drink! Then when yer ready fer a fill up or a refill ya come up to the bar an’ I’ll fill it up from a fun lil device! Genius if ya ask me!” Silver said with a laugh as the spluttering died away and was replaced with more tinkering sounds.<br/><br/>“Isn’t it just?” Demon looked ever so pleased as she glanced down to her lover. “By the way, first beta types are ready. If’n ya want me to just go ahead and hand those out at the party, we can shoot all the birds with one big -*! stone,” she laughed. “Bowling for birds!”<br/><br/>“Bowling for birds?” Ashok asked, wondering what the hell was going on. Ratheron was just as confused and Silver was giggling like a mad man from under the bar as he hopped up to stand again.<br/><br/>“Aye! Bowlin’ fer birds! Its gonna be fun!” He said with a wink at all of them, a wide grin spreading across his face as he stole in towards Silver and took a kiss from her before diving back under the bar.<br/><br/>“Bowling for birds it is!” Shadow laughed. “I can’t wait to see our friends again. We’ll be passing out invitations,” she slid her hand into Ratheron’s with a happy smile. “I hope your keg tapper is done by then, Silver. Ashy,” she nodded a farewell to the warrior. “Demon,” she giggled and gave pause as she glanced back towards Ares. The assassin, however, had closed his eyes and almost seemed as if he was asleep. For whatever reason, he was here, and Selethen was nowhere to be seen. But if it was any of her business, she would have already known what was going on.<br/><br/>-------<br/><br/><em>Two weeks later...</em><br/><br/>Entreri yawned as he stretched out on the bar, for some reason the bounty hunter thought it was an acceptable place to lounge. Why that was no one would really know but Ashok had just walked down the stairs and growled at the bounty hunter.<br/><br/>(3/4)

"Get off!"<br/><br/>"No."<br/><br/>"Do it."<br/><br/>"Make me."<br/><br/>"You'd enjoy that too much."<br/><br/>"I don't swing tha' way bud."<br/><br/>"Is that why Silver brags about tying you up and bending you over?"<br/><br/>"No no. Ya mixed it up again ya dolt! She's the one tha's bent over an' cuffed. I know its confusin' an' sh*t with us sharin' the same name an' all but come on man! I know ya a smart cookie!"<br/><br/>At this point Ashok was standing next to the bar with his arms folded over his chest staring at Entreri with a look of annoyance.<br/><br/>"Kick his !@# boss!" A shout from the door which caused Ashok to sigh, whatever possessed Entreri to invite Shivy and Alexander to this event was beyond him but now he had a giant ex-gladiator guarding the door and an alcoholic dwarf making drinks for everyone. Silver cackled with laughter.<br/><br/>"Startin' a brawl afore the party starts? Ain't his style!"<br/><br/>"You would know."<br/><br/>"Damn straight I would!"<br/><br/>Silver sounded slightly miffed as he sat up and let his legs dangling off the bar. He then looked around and noticed that the others were finally getting up and coming downstairs.<br/><br/>"Sh*t ya ninnies! What took ya so long ta get up!?"<br/><br/>"We had a long night remember?"<br/><br/>"No." Silver laughed wickedly at that.<br/><br/>"Oh right you were getting mauled by a tiger."<br/><br/>"I ain't the furry doggy!"<br/><br/>"If you insist on continuing that line of thinking I may take a bite out of you." Fenris growled, snapping his jaws playfully at Silver.<br/><br/>"Oh this is sure to be one hell of a party..." Alaric murmured as he watched the byplay between Fenris and Silver from the stairs. Ashok looked up and raised his eyebrow at his young friend.<br/><br/>"You can't really talk, considering you're dating a f*cking corpse."<br/><br/>"That's not very nice."<br/><br/>"I wasn't trying to be nice."<br/><br/>"No but normally when you want to win someone over to not telling stories about you, you don't start by insulting their girlfriend."<br/><br/>At this point the others were laughing, most of them knew Ashok's drunken stories but there would be new blood tonight.<br/><br/>And plenty of stories to tell.<br/><br/>"Stories?"<br/><br/>A new voice, someone had decided to show up early and lo and behold it was the other 'host,' as it were, a tall Sin'dorei who walked into the tavern with confidence. He didn't even bat an eyelash at Alexander who was trying to look menacing. The monk was carrying two rather large kegs as if they weighed nothing and gently set them on the bar.<br/><br/>"For you as a... tavern warming present?" He said questioningly and Silver chuckled, flipping backward into the bar area before taking one keg and moving it under the bar to set it up to his new tap system. Ashok sighed and shook his head, "You don't want to hear these stories."<br/><br/>"Oh but I assure you I do." Ratheron countered and the expression on his face was almost impossible to read as he smiled benignly at the humans around him. He was a hard man to peg and all of them knew that such men were normally dangerous.<br/><br/>"Oi! Ya c*ckgobblin' pusses! Lets start drinkin'!" Shivy shouted from the kitchen, the dwarf rolling out from the kitchen with several bottles of what could only be called his own personal moonshine.<br/><br/>Ratheron raised his eyebrow but was unable to stop the dwarf from shoving a bottle into his hands before the dwarf zoomed off to find another person to give a bottle too. "DRINKIN' TIME!!!!" He shouted at the top of his lungs.<br/><br/>(4/4)

Where Ratheron went, Shadow was normally not far behind. But, she was further behind than usual, carrying a large bag that looked about as heavy as the woman herself was. Dragging it along the docks, she sighed heavily, only to shudder as a chill swept over her. Normally, Booty Bay was a hot place, being on the southern tip of a continent and surrounded by humid jungle. So it was a shock to the elf when the wave of cold intensified and she dropped the bag quickly, reaching into it to pull out a candy cane as she expected a familiar sociopathic Death Knight to be looming over her.<br/><br/>Rather, she was greeted by the sight of a rather averaged sized human, female judging by the chest. Her face was hidden behind a skull's face which blazed with an eerie green light. It was hard to tell if the mask itself was actual bone or not, but it had far too much detail for Shadow's taste. Very realistic. It made her stomach churn as the woman tilted her head, flecks of something black falling from the horned helm.<br/><br/>Without explanation, the Death Knight took the candy cane from the Sin'dorei's hand before proceeding to grab the straps of the bag and hefted it. Shadow felt a mild tingle of jealousy at the woman's strength, but she pointed at the tavern nonetheless. It wasn't too far from where she had ended up.<br/><br/>"I don't suppose you could help me get in there, could you?" the woman spoke Common fluidly, offering a bright smile to the masked female. A laugh answered her, harsh and amused rather than full of any kind of happiness, the chill permeating the air growing harsher.<br/><br/>"Alright, elf," Trinity growled in response as she dragged the large bag into the tavern, where the men were hooting and hollering over something or other. She dropped the bag onto the floor next to one of the tables and made her way towards a familiar Paladin. Shadow checked the contents of her bag carefully before glancing over curiously as the Death Knight removed her helm and stuck the candy cane between her lips, grinning at Alaric.<br/><br/>"Oh, they come in pairs," Trinity sounded nearly giddy as she noticed Ratheron, eyeing the man with a bit more interest than made Shadow comfortable. Without the helm on, the woman didn't look bad at all. Her eyes glowed the usual frosty blue of a Death Knight and her hair was tied back out of her face. Pulling the candy cane from her lips, she offered it to Alaric.<br/><br/>"And here I thought I was going to get here before the guests did! Damn my inability to not get side tracked!" Trinity laughed.<br/><br/>"There's a lot more to come, still," Shadow smiled despite the woman's tone. It was hard to tell, but there was something off about the woman. Or, maybe it was just Death Knights in general. But Lin always seemed fairly happy. This woman seemed almost pissed off about something. Maybe she didn't like elves? Something simply felt off, or simply wrong, but Shadow shook her head, trying to dismiss it.<br/><br/>"Zari and Varus will be coming, I think. And Rhannah, Kel, Ri--" Shadow felt a weight hit her and suddenly was rolling on the floor, struggling to get a grasp on whatever had its grasp on her. Teeth sank into her neck and she squeaked as the flurry of a hunter released her binding grasp and rolled away, leaving Shadow on the floor.<br/><br/>"She bit me!" Shadow wailed as if it was the end of the world, only to dissolve into giggles.<br/><br/>"My Shadow!" Demon's eyes narrowed at Ratheron, her expression possessive and threatening. Another human, one who always had a few too many daggers on her person, Shadow couldn't help at smile widely, even as she rubbed the hunter slobber from her neck. <br/><br/>"And thus," Trinity intoned flatly, "Silver's f*ck toy ran away with an elf."<br/><br/>"Never!" Shadow gasped before attempting to crawl back to Ratheron. Demon, however, simply kept herself between the elves.

Ah yes.....Booty Bay. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy, in the world of Azeroth.....except maybe Gadegetzan....or Area 52....any town owned by goblins is really a hive of scum and villainy now that I think about it....huh....anyway. As a transport ship pulls into port, three very peculiar looking people step off. <br/><br/>Specifically the Blood Elf Death Knight, Lineron Plagueweaver holding a black pipe to his mouth, the contents of said pipe may or not be of the legal kind of substance. Following him was his nephew, Carinoth Duskweaver, carrying one end of a large chest covered with chains, locks, and magic runes. Carrying the other end of the chest was Mei Darkale, an average sized pandaren women with a staff on her back and obviously looking exhausted from carrying the chest. "Why the fel aren't you carrying this bloody thing!? Your the strongest one here!" Carinoth said, shouting at his uncle.<br/><br/>"Yeah......don't feel like it." Lineron inhaled from the pipe in his mouth then looked around. "Carinoth, where is this inn Rathy said to go too?" He glared at his uncle then sighed.<br/>"The Legion's End if I remember right, I believe it is in one of the more.....seedier parts of this place." Lineron cracked his back.<br/>"Oh joy, I love Booty Bay! Always something new to find every time you come here!" He says cheerfully.<br/>"The last time you were here that Forsaken women tried to kill you...with a spoon...."<br/><br/>"A spoon?" Mei says in confusion.<br/><br/>"Yes, she tried to kill him with a spoon. A SPOON!"<br/><br/>"Shut it! Let's get this over with, then you and me can go back to Pandaria while Mei here beings her training with Shadow." Mei blushes a little then looks down at the ground.<br/>"Oh fine, I can insult you when we get to the inn anyway." Lineron rolled his eyes at his nephew then they both continued on there way to find the inn. <br/><br/>When they finally after hours and a uh....*cough* misunderstanding involving a goblin shaman, his girlfriend, and Mei not knowing what the hell is going on. They finally arrived at the inn with both Mei and Carinoth being exhausted from the events of the past few hours and from them carrying the chest the entire time. The door to the inn would be kicked open by Lineron and they would enter the inn and Lineron raising and eyebrow at Shadow being on the ground. "Shadow. Sweety. The fel?" He said then put his pipe into his mouth, looking with a amused expression down at Shadow. When suddenly Carinoth's sweaty fingers finally lost there grip of the chest and slipped from his grip, his end of the chest landing on his feet.<br/><br/>"FFFFFFFuuuuuu........." He goes into a silent scream then sits down in the nearest chair. Lineron looked back at him with a bored expression then looks at Ratheron with the same bored expression. "Anyway, meet Mei. She I guess will be Shadow's student or something. The thing we talked about is inside that chest, talk to me and I can unlock it for you. Oh, and if a pissed off looking Goblin women comes in here asking about us, we aren't here. Now..." Lineron looks down at Shadow again. "The fel?" Mei drags the heavy chest over to a table then rests her head against it and closes her eyes.

<strong>Kel'tira Sunblaze</strong><br/><br/>The sea wind caught Kel'tira Sunblaze's shoulder-length hair as she used her knees and the reins lightly to guide the drake she was mounted on low across the waves, creature and rider enjoying the brisk snap of the waves beneath them. Sea spray splashed up as Kel danced the drake, graceful in air but less so on ground. Booted toes scraped white capped wave as Kel laughed softly and drew up, guiding the drake higher as they approached the cape of Stranglethorn's point.<br/><br/>Booty Bay, city of cons and scams, gold and jewels, rich and poor. <br/><br/>The smell of fish and fried food and refuse hit her, the sounds of gulls screaming and people clamoring for attention rolled over her as if a physical thing, a physical press crushing down on her.<br/><br/>With a laugh, she swooped through the noise on her mount, touching down on the end of an empty dock and slipping from the saddle deftly, though she stumbled and caught herself against the drake as sh straightened. Her loose tunic shone emerald in the light, the cloth seeming to shimmer as she stretched and dusted her black slacks off. On her belt hung a simple, black scabbard. The sword hilt that showed was plain, black leather and shining metal worn with use. The long bladed knife that hung from her other bore the same black and silver simplicity. <br/><br/>Her hair hung loose, emerald and black earrings studded her ears and a silver hoop in the top of the left ear caught the sun in a brilliant shimmer that threw the light back cheerfully. A pat on the proto-drake's leg sent the creature winging away in a burst of violet scales. <br/><br/>Cheerfully, the paladin set off down the boardwalk, content to wander through the city as she hunted down the inn that Shadow had told her of. <br/><br/>When she reached it, it was not without some trepidation that she opened the door and stepped inside, letting her eyes adjust to the lighting as she did so. She took in Shadow on the floor, a smile spreading lopsidedly across her face. Her eyes lingered on the group of Lineron's companions.<br/><br/>"Linny," she joked, "Where'd you pick up the Pandaren?"<br/><br/>With a laugh, she smiled brightly at Shadow, then Ratheron, "I'm not late, am I?"

Booty Bay…it smelled like fish, urine and ale. Fynnariel grimaced as she stepped off the ship. Close quarters on a small vessel that rocked? It was all she could do to hold her stomach. She definitely preferred flying to ships. The huntress sat on a nearby barrel, taking a moment to let the queasiness in her stomach disappear.<br/><br/>A sea breeze kicked up, blowing in some fresh salty air… and also carrying away the invitation in her hand. Fyn stared after it forlornly, now how was she supposed to find the party? <br/><br/>The great black bear at her side sniffed around the dock, caught on to the scent of something he clearly enjoyed and took off.<br/><br/>“Bors wait!!!!” Fyn chased the bear down the main drag of Booty Bay, nearly knocking several goblins and one very displeased looking dwarf into the water. <br/><br/>Moment’s later huntress and bear ended up outside a set of tavern doors. Bors pawed at the door and looked up at her. “You are the strangest animal I ev-“<br/><br/>Laughter from inside the building cut in before she could scold the bear. The laughter sounded familiar. “This must be where the party is at.” Fyn patted Bors on the head and tossed him a fish, which he greedily ate. <br/><br/>Her hand reached out for the door handle, but she hesitated. There sounded like a lot of people in there, and the building didn’t seem overly spacious. Also there was that little part about alcohol being inside. Sighing Fyn backed up and leaned heavily against a railing. <br/>
For a long moment she just glowered at the door, trying to work up the courage to go in. Bors looked up at her and made a whining sound. “I don’t think they’ll let you in.” The bear lumbered over to her and stood up on his hind legs. The animal stuck his large head in her face and licked her with his tongue. Fynnariel couldn’t stop laughing as she caught his head and scratched behind his ears. “Yes I know you’re a big, cuddly, teddy bear. But they don’t.” She pushed the bear back down. “You’ll have to wait outside.”<br/><br/>Again she eyed the door reluctant to open it, taking one final deep breath Fynnariel went for it. Opening the door to the tavern and stepping inside, she almost ran straight into Kel. She opened her mouth to greet everyone but no sound came out, so she gave them all an awkward half wave instead.

Lineron turned to Kel'tira and put on a large smile, pulling out the pipe in his mouth. "Kelly! Why hello my dear!" He tilts his head towards Mei then back at Kel'tira. "Oh, Mei I got found back in Pandaria. Saved her and her sister from Saurok. She makes THE BEST martini's, honestly who should ask her to make you one once your less..." He gestures to her stomach. "Pregger's and stuff." He smirks at her then turns back to Shadow and gives her a hand to help her up. "Need a hand, speck?"<br/><br/>Carinoth notices Fynnariel come through the door and a small smile appears beneath his scarf, as well as a creeping blush. "H-hello Fyn. Would you like a drink?" He says then removes his hat and scarf from his head and sets them on the table. <br/><br/>Mei opens her eyes slightly and looks to see Lineron holding his hand out for Shadow to grab. She gets up from her seat and walks over slowly, slightly shy of all the people he is around. "M-master Lineron, who is this?" Lineron chuckles then shows her an insane smile, barring his sharpened teeth. She shrinks back a little at the sight of this.<br/>"Well, this is Kelly, she is all pregger's and stuff." He says then points at Kel'tira. "The women lying on the floor is Shadow, who shall be teaching you all the boring monk stuff." He says gesturing to Shadow. "The guy standing over there is Rathy. He is the guy I told you about that NEEDS to smoke a few bushes of Bloodthistle, so he can chill the fel out." He says then points to Ratheron, while raising his eyebrows in an annoying manner. "And the rest of these guys are losers, so you don't need to know about them...." He says with a evil chuckle at the end. Mei crosses her arms then looks down at the floor, speaking softly.<br/>"Ah....hi. I'm Mei." She looks at Shadow with a nervous look. "Are you really going to be my new master?"

The humans waited politely as the elves spoke to each other and figured things out. Silver had an amused expression on his face as he watched Ratheron merely wait for the human woman to turn her back. He knew her type, she respected power and action and not words so he would show her as much. He knew that she would be upset that Lineron was taking Shadow away from her and would turn and get involved soon enough. Alexander for his part was grinning like a predator as he walked up to Blood Elf Death Knight.<br/><br/>"Losers eh? I remember you." He said, his smiling telling the whole world what he had in mind on how to handle the disrespect Lineron was showering their way. But another was already beating him to the punch.<br/><br/>"Lineron. It might be best to -not- insult all of them. They do outnumber you and they have a rather good knack for kicking *ss." A bored voice spoke from the shadows, only coming out after finishing the statement. Selethen was playing with a dagger, his customary armor set aside for a simple set of black leathers as he looked around the tavern with a bored expression.<br/><br/>"I must admit I expected you to show up in a giant pack, not trusting something bad to happen to you when you arrived."<br/><br/>"Oh something bad will happen! Don't worry, I ate before I came! But I'm sure to get hungry before the night is through!"<br/><br/>Selethen turned to see another large hulking warrior walking down the stairs, but this one had a feral light to his eyes. Fenris MacMillan, the Gilnean warrior eyed the new arrivals with sort of a hungry eye as if he were deciding which of them to eat first.<br/><br/>"But don't worry, I have to treat elf flesh specially, naturally it just tastes so..." He gestured in the air as if looking for a certain word and yet he couldn't find it.<br/><br/>"Its so bland of course!" Tai offered, human Death Knight now standing behind Fynn in the doorway, grinning evilly down at the huntress. He wasn't going to cause a problem for anyone but that didn't mean he could tease and toy with them.<br/><br/>It was after all a specialty of his.<br/><br/>"Tai. Step away from tha innocents an' prepare ta get drunk!" Shivvy shouted from the bar, leaning down and picking up a vial of some liquid, pouring it into the bottle he was holding. Re-stoppering the bottle he chucked it across the room at the Death Knight who caught it.<br/><br/>"Oh Shivvy! You shouldn't have! How will I ever repay you?" Tai said with a wicked smile as he stepped around Fynn and Carinoth, moving to stand next to Alexander. "But as my tall friend here was saying, you shouldn't insult us. We like to fight, and while you might be a Death Knight these men have been my brothers for far longer than you." Tai's tone was admonishing as if Lineron had committed an atrocious preach of protocol.

"Hi, guys!" the monk smiled happily, as if there wasn't a problem with being on the floor.<br/><br/>Shadow reached up to Lin's hand to take it, only to be swept up quite suddenly by the human hunter, her ocean green eyes alight with a mischievous glow as she hissed at the lot, "Mine!"<br/><br/>Demon then proceeded to insult their family, saying that they smelled of fish in very broken and rough Thalassian while smiling. Her tone was soothing, calming, as if the woman hadn't a damn clue what she was saying. But her accent was so atrocious that Shadow began to giggle, hanging almost limp from the woman's arms. Nothing could ever be normal around the hunter. Without further ado, Demon began to drag her prize happily back towards Silver, looking pleased with herself.<br/><br/>"Three-way!" Demon shouted a bit too loudly, and a bit too happily.<br/><br/>"Ack!" Shadow squirmed, only to give up. Demon had a good lock on her from behind. She turned to pout first at Ratheron as she was stolen, then towards Tai. "I am not bland!" she huffed, as if that was the most insulting thing ever. Demon gave pause, sniffed the elf, then dropped her suddenly before darting away with a laugh.<br/><br/>"Bland elf!" Demon crowed.<br/><br/>"Ow!" Shadow hit the floor a second time, only to giggle as she smiled over at Mei, her grin softening into a shy expression. "I suppose I will be. If you'd permit it…" she rubbed the side of her head and giggled a bit more before waving to Selethen. "Hello!"<br/><br/>Trinity couldn't help at stare at the two women as if they were insane. Their energy levels seemed to play off of each other, rising to a ridiculous peak. Demon, she had gotten to know vaguely enough, but the woman was acting as if drugged. And the elf was no better, as if she was already drunk. Her eyes shot towards her 'brothers' before rolling to the ceiling as she returned to enjoying her candy cane. <br/><br/>"Think you should really even be offering to train someone? You just got your !@# flattened, dragged around, then dropped like yesterday's newspaper," she grinned at Shadow, who blinked over at Trinity.<br/><br/>"Not really!" Shadow smiled happily. "But I'd rather try, I'd rather help someone than turn my back on them. And everyone says I should, so…"<br/><br/>"Oh, well if everyone says you should, then by all means!" Trinity laughed. <br/><br/>Another woman slipped inside around that time, brushing past the group at the doorway without a word of greeting. Another human, this one wore tight-fitting black armor trimmed with gold, the scars on her sides revealed, her auburn hair bound back with a tie and her eyes, cold and blue as any Death Knight's, were narrowed at the group. Suspicious, but she simply held her tongue as she went to the bar to check the supply of vials that Shivvy had gotten into, growling softly at the fact that anyone had intruded in her precious work.<br/><br/>"Just be careful," Leiris Stone said suddenly to the dwarf. "We don't want to kill anyone, now, do we?" her expression turned into a rather vicious grin, as if she wasn't helping the Death Knights at all, but poisoning them.<br/><br/>"Lei-Lei!" Demon crooned as she sidled up to her cousin, rather than chase anymore elves. "What's wrong? Didn't get your head count before you came? I'm sure you could practice on Tai, he'd love the head!"<br/><br/>Lei gave the dark-haired woman a flat stare, only to shake her head slowly. Demon's grin faded into another pout.<br/><br/>"Spoil sport."

Leon Sunblade sat at his sister's kitchen table, toying with a piece of paper that still held the shape of the envelope it had been pulled out of. He raised an eyebrow as he looked at her, watching as she moved around the kitchen. She worried him on occasions. This was one of them.<br/><br/>“Are you going?”<br/>Rhannah sighed, placing the knife on the table before turning to face him. “I don't know. Part of me wants to go, but you know me and parties. I wouldn't even consider it if it wasn't Shadow that had asked me to go.”<br/>Leon smiled one of those smiles that his sister knew so well. The kind that made her want to slap him and bring him down a peg or two. “Don't you dare look at me like that! I'm not letting you near her! I don't want you telling any of those stories.”<br/><br/>“Aww. Come on Rhanabelle. I won't do that, I promise. I just want to meet her, see why she's connected with you like she has..”<br/>Rhannah bristled at the use of her childhood nickname. Leon's smug smile was replaced with a look of contrition that she almost believed. A few seconds later he broke into a grin that was accompanied by a teasing look in his eye. Rhannah grabbed a salt shaker from next to her and through at him. Her brother had seen it coming and ducked. The missile flew past him and crashed into a cupboard on the other side of the kitchen. Salt flew out of a crack in the lid and spilt over the floor.<br/><br/>Rhannah glared as she bent to clean up the mess. She tossed a small pinch of the salt over her shoulder then swept up the offending crystals. “Now look what you made me do.”<br/>“Relax Rhan. I'm sure it will be fun.”<br/>“Don't you start!” She turned on him, her glare in full force. “Not you as well. I can handle Medra, but I hate it when you two team up. I never win when you do!”<br/>“How is Medra? I haven't seen her for a while.”<br/>Rhannah shrugged. “She's Medra. The second she got the invitation, she was going on about what she was going to wear, quizzing me about all the people in the fellowship and so on. For a rogue, she can be quite girly when she wants.”<br/>“Have you heard fom Jae lately?”<br/>“No, and I don't want to either. That bytch is going to get her spoiled princess ways slapped out of her if I get my hands on her.”<br/>Leon sighed and wondered, not for the first time, how three women, all so very different in their personalities and outlooks could be sisters. Then again, he and Zakia were very different as well. Even though he loved his little brother and would die to protect him, the two could never stay in the same room for long without arguing.<br/>“And Zak?”<br/>Rhannah's expression changed to one of concern.<br/>“Something wrong with Zak?”<br/>She threw her hands into the air, exasperation written all over her face. “I don't know, Leon. Lately, he's been quiet, insular. We go to picnics with fellowship members and he would rather sit with his back to the group watching the waves hit the beach. He's even stopped teasing Medra. When I'm with him, I can sense that something's not quite right, that there's a darkness to him that wasn't there a few months ago. Or if it was, it was so well hidden that even I couldn't sense it.”<br/><br/>Leon raised an eyebrow in surprise. Rhannah had been the one that was closest to Zakia all through out childhood. She was the one he had turned to if their mother was busy or not around. The thought of something being hidden so well that Rhannah couldn't sense it in their younger brother was concerning. “I'll try to get to the bottom of it.”<br/>Rhannah snorted at the thought. “You? You two would kill each other before you got the chance. I'll talk to Zak. He's more likely to tell me than you.”<br/>“Will he be going?”<br/>“I think so, he was invited. As was Jen.”<br/>Leon's face darkened as he thought of the beautiful paladin. Rhannah grinned. <em>I thought so.</em> “She has gotten to you. So tell me, big brother, have you kissed her?”<br/>His embarrasment deepened, darkening the blush even more. “A gentleman never tells.”<br/>“So you have! It's about time. I thought you were never going to get over Narella.”<br/>Rhannah's glee was written all over her face. “I'm so happy for you. She's a much better match for you than Narella ever was.”<br/>“I think so too.”<br/>“So have you? Rhannah's raised eyebrow finished the question. Leon shook his head with a smile. “No, but I plan to and soon. I promised her that our first time would be something she would remember with a smile all her life. I just have to work out how to make that promise come true.”<br/>“If you ask me, you should put aside your gentlemanly ways for the night. She wants you in the worst possible way. I think she would be over the moon however it happens.”<br/>He shrugged his shoulders, a far away look developing in her eyes. “Maybe you're right. But I cannot be anything other than I am.”<br/><br/>1/2

Three days later, all four siblings were standing on the docks of Booty Bay about to enter the Legion's End Tavern. “I still don't believe you lot ganged up on me like this.”<br/>“You always did have to be goaded into action Rhan.”<br/>Rhannah turned and widened her eyes as she saw her cousin approaching them. “Kass? Are you coming too?”<br/>Kassyndrah shook her head. “No, I can't stay, I'm about to head for Deepholm. I just wanted to tell you to relax. You'll be fine.”<br/>“I just wish Rian were here.”<br/>“I thought he said he was going to meet you here.”<br/>“He did, but he's even more nervous about parties than I am.”<br/>Kassyndrah laughed at the thought of someone being more nervous about parties than Rhannah. “I didn't think that was possible. But even if he doesn't make it, you have your sister and brothers with you, and you know some of the people in there. It won't be as bad as you think. Relax, have a drink or two and enjoy yourself, you'll be fine.”<br/><br/>Kassyndrah left for the boat, leaving Rhannah standing at the doorway, working up the courage to go in. “Ok, let's go.” She plastered a smile on her face and tried to quell the butterflies in her stomach as she stepped over the threshold into the chaos of the party.<br/><br/>2/2

Zakia Sunblade stood absolutely still, his naked torso glistening with the sweat from his recent daily training, it was a ritual for the young rogue to train every morning. His swords hung loosely in his hands, his eyes were closed, if not for the rise and fall of his chest some people may have mistaken him for a very lifelike statue. A bird chirped in the distance, and Zakia sprung into motion his swords arcing racefully through the air in complicated parries, cuts, and thrusts. This went on for several minutes before he suddenly stopped, if one looked closely they could see the fire burning in his fel green eyes. He took a deep breath putting his body in a relaxed position, for several more minutes he stood there taking deep calming breaths, and when his eyes opened they were normal once again.<br/><br/>The young blood elf sighed, "That was too close, he even tries to come out when I train now," the, "he," that the rogue referred to was this other personality he seemed to have, one completely different from kind, and compassionate Zakia Sunblade his family knew, and loved. This other personality was brash, arrogant, and cared for nothing, but the kill, and it was this personality that had kept him so insular the last few weeks, for he feared what might happen if that other personality revealed itself, and hurt a member of the Fellowship, or worse one of his siblings. That fear had caused him to become somewhat of a recluse, he had isolated himself from his family, and the members of the Fellowship, he saw his sister Rhannah occasionally, but other than her he was alone. <br/><br/>Having been cut off from everyone, he had been surprised that morning when he retrieved an envelope from his mailbox, and he looked at that letter now. "Rhannah must have told someone where to contact me, but what could be in there," his curiosity finally got the better of him, and he sheathed his blades, draped a towel around his neck, and picked up the letter. Opening the letter revealed an invitation to some sort of party hosted by the Fellowship, "What the fel, this had to be Medra's doing Rhan knows I hate parties." Crumpling up the invitation he threw it away, "I just won't go, and that's all there is to it," he muttered as he went inside to wash himself off.<br/><br/>Three days later found the young Zakia Sunblade standing outside the Legion's End Tavern, his sisters, and brother next to him. He wore his simple leather armor, and boots, which also held two small daggers, he knew his siblings didn't approve of his attire, but he could care less. "I still don't know how I let you guys talk me into this," he muttered, it was obvious by his tone that he had no desire to be here. It was bad enough the tavern rested in Booty Bay, but he was already picturing how many things could go wrong with him being here. These thoughts haunted him as he followed behind his siblings into the tavern, trying to remain as small as possible.

Fyn’s creeping smile at seeing Carinoth vanished instantly at the sound of Tai’s voice. She jumped and hastily moved so the Death Knight was in her field of vision. The huntress glowered at him while he stepped around her. <em>Humans…eat elf flesh? Ha.</em><br/><br/>For a brief moment she stared around, gauging the mood in the room with a frown. <em>Things could get ugly soon if the insults keep flying.</em> Fyn felt an odd protectiveness for her new family that she wasn’t accustomed to. <br/><br/>The elf shrugged her cloak off and went to Carinoth. Instantly glad that she opted for the top she wore, while revealing, it was far too warm in the tavern for anything else. Besides Fyn was so uncomfortable at this point that breathing was even becoming an issue. She smiled up at Carinoth, her cheeks turning pink. “I-I don’t drink.” She looked a bit embarrassed. “If they have moon berry juice or something…?”<br/><br/>The huntress’s eyes flew to the door as Rhannah, Leon, Medra and Zak entered. She waved at them and perched awkwardly in a chair like she might jump off it at any moment.

Lineron makes a bored look at Alexander when he comes up to him. "Do I know you?" He says then puts his pipe his his mouth, taking an inhale of it then blowing out smoke rings into Alexander's face. He continued looking at Alexander then his ear twitched when Fenris talked about eating elf flesh. He grinned evilly then responded with "Indeed, though I personally prefer the flesh of wolves. Put on the right seasoning, maybe drown it in Orc blood, delicious!" Then Lineron's ear twitched when Tai spoke up. "Oh fel, not this guy..."<br/><br/>Carinoth glared at Tai as he stood behind Fyn, grinning evilly behind her. When Fyn came to his table he smiled beneath his scarf then removed his hat and placed it on the table. "Its okay, I will see what they have in a few minutes." When Rhannah and her siblings arrived he waved lightly at them with a bored expression.<br/><br/>As Tai spoke to Lineron he just gave a bored look at both Alexander and Tai. When he finished speaking to him he inhaled from his pipe again then blew more smoke rings into there faces. "I honestly couldn't care less, brother dear. And don't talk to me as if just broke some rule." <br/><br/>As Shadow was talking to the others, Mei held herself in her arms tightly and blushed heavily. <em>'Will I even be a good student? Master Lineron says her master is very rough and breaks down his students. What if I can't deal with that? What if I am a horrible student?'</em> She shook her head then, in her shyness, quickly did a back flip onto a table then jumped off then table and huddled in a corner of the inn.<br/><br/>But as the commotion of the inn started to pick up, the door to the inn was suddenly punched in and what was standing in the entrance way was one obviously pissed and incredibly wet undead warlock glaring into the inn. The women stomped into the inn, growling demonically, stepping around Rhannah and her family. Carinoth had come back to the table with some drinks and had set them down on the table, drinking one then spit it out what was in his mouth as he stared at the undead women making her way in the inn. "Mother?!" Lineron jumped when Carinoth shouted this then turned around slowly and smiled down at her as she came up to him.<br/>"LINERON DAWNWEAVER!!!" She shouts in his face.<br/>"Daenith! How was the swim? I'm sure the sharks would have loved you!" Daenith's eye twitched then both of her eyes started to glow purple and leak fel energy.<br/>"Do you even know how bloody long it took me to swim from the middle ocean to Grom'gol to here?" She says in the calmest voice she can make, but her anger is still obviously present.<br/> <br/>"A long time?" Lineron replies nonchalantly. <br/>"I had to bloody swim through shark infested waters. Fire magic doesn't work in water. Did you know that? I had to beat them off with my staff. Which got eaten and I had to carve my way into the bloody thing's stomach and wretch it out of there. Then I had to deal with paranoid Orc's who thought it odd that an undead women was crawling up the beach. Then I had to deal with the loud and annoying yelling of some Goblin and his !@#$% of a girlfriend. SO in short." Two small horns appeared on her head and her teeth had morphed into sharpened teeth. "<em>Outside. NOW!</em>" Daenith growled out demonically at her brother. Lineron frowned at Daenith then rolled his eyes and walked outside the inn.<br/>"Hello, Rhannah. Enjoy the party." Daenith says quickly (and actually normally) at Rhannah as she walks out of the inn with her brother walking behind her.<br/><br/>Carinoth groaned then sipped his beverage as a flash of green light can be seen from the windows and the door to the inn can be seen opening again with Daenith looking normal again and Lineron (who's entire front is charred now) standing behind her with a bored and blackened face. "Indeed, that just happened." Daenith said calmly then walked into the inn and noticing Mei in the corner of the inn. "Mei! Oh, what is wrong deary?" She says in a worried tone then rushes over to her side. After Daenith ran towards Mei, Lineron's eyes rolled up into the back of his head and he fell face first into the floor. Carinoth breathes in deeply then lets out a long sigh as he rubs his eyes. "He will be fine but....Fel. Damn. It. Uncle." Carinoth finishes the rest of his drink then sets it down on the table with a frown. "Maybe I should take up smoking?" He says thinking openly.

The note was written in a way that it was hard to refuse. Jana liked Shadow, even though the monk had not had a lot to do with her time in the Fellowship. The friendly and outgoing personality gave Jana a reason to trust that the tavern would be a good place to meet the others they would be working with to best the sorceror Tychus.<br/><br/>Dressed in a casual mix of leathers and cloth, Jana got off the boat and sauntered up the pier. She arrived at the tavern in time to see Lineron being roasted by his sister. She chuckled to herself and came up behind him. "I see the fun has already started. Have you been inside yet? I am a little apprehensive. I do not always get along with humans, or any of the Alliance for that matter. It is only Shadow's words I take for this to be a peaceful gathering."<br/><br/>The rogue was only basically armed with a dagger on one hip and her customary handaxe on the other hip. The cloak she wore covered her head against the bright sun of Booty Bay. It swept behind her almost touching the ground. Under the cloak Jana was wiry and agile, her auburn hair tucked into a tail. Her golden hoop earrings glistened in the faint light that would reveal her deep emerald eyes if anyone looked close.<br/><br/>She waited for Lineron to recover and stand before she entered the tavern. Slipping inside and looking around in curiousity. "I see the gang is mostly all here, hello to you all. I hope this night finds new friends." her voice calm and friendly.

Rhannah smiled as she entered the tavern. A few of the people she had met through the fellowship had already arrived. She waved in reply to Fyn's wave and moved to join the huntress. <br/><br/>Leon, Medra and Zak followed behind her and got themselves a drink from the bar. Rhannah had been surprised when Zak had met them at the tavern. Like her, he had never been one for parties, but somehow he had come anyway. Rhannah waited until the others had moved away from the bar to greet Fyn. <br/><br/>Something about the huntress spoke to her and brought out the same sort of instincts she had around her sisters and brothers. Rhannah smiled and took a sip of her own drink, a simple apple juice. "Hello Fyn. It's good to see you here. Now I'm glad I let Leon and Medra talk me into coming."

Zakia stayed at the back of his family, looking around for the most secluded place he could find, he didn't have long to look as Rhannah saw someone she knew, and led them all into the tavern. He followed quickly into step behind them, trying to be as unnoticeable as possible, he followed his siblings to the bar, of course he didn't drink. His other personality found it incredibly easy to assert his influence, when Zak was under the influence of alcohol. So he simply ordered water, and moved away from the bar so Rhnnah could talk to her friend, he found a small table behind the stairs, with a perfect view of the entire tavern, so he quickly moved over to it, and sat down.<br/><br/>He was not well acquainted with many of the members of the Fellowship, in fact he was technically not even officially a member. He was invited only because of Rhannah, or Medra, more than likely, and he wished whichever was the cause had left him out of this. He found parties to be a waste of time, and energy, to him people only threw parties, for the sole purpose of getting drunk beyond all reason. He had better things to do than get drunk, and so he sat at his small secluded table, and watched the others with a descerning eye.
