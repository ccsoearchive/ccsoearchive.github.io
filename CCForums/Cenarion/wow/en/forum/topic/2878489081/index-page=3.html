Ria stood her ground firmly, legs spread to shoulder's width. Although she was in common cloths and unarmed, the young elf spoke with presence rarely seen with her. <br/><br/>"I -won't- risk hurting my family."<br/><br/>Her not taking a stand against the night's events ruffled a few feathers. Ardam had attacked a member of her order, but she would not actively stand against the Ocheliad. She would remain defensive and offer her services around the new barracks, unless ordered otherwise by her knight - Cray. <br/><br/>She turned from the crowd to speak privately to Cray as she tended to his gryphon's saddle. In the end, her mind was a little more at ease. She couldn't have asked for a better knight. He respected her loyalty to her family and this meant the world to her. As well as, he encouraged her happiness. Which meant she was to go fishing this evening instead of in the morning. <br/><br/>Ria had been given a few requests from her knight.. To occupy Cyrus some. So she fast-forwarded some plans, hoping he would accept the offer. Cray also wanted to meet Ria's suitor. The Druid that sword to keep Ria safe, from all threats. She packed up her fishing pole and flew south th Elwynn Forest for some fishing. Hoping her Druid would emerge from the shadows. And indeed he did.

While she was there in body her thoughts were elsewhere, with her family, with her friends, and for the first time in a very long time, this division of duty and loyalty did not bother the priestess.<br/><br/>Her thoughts easily drifted to a scene days before on the steps of her home.<br/><br/><em>"I don't think I can do it," she said looking up at Narnicka.<br/><br/>"What?"<br/><br/>"Hold up my end of things with Cyrus." <br/><br/>"I will speak to him."<br/><br/>She did not miss the look on her husband's face, knowing that this was not an easy thing.</em><br/><br/>She drifted in and out of her own memories, sorting them out.<br/><em><br/>"So Eidan remains in the North," Taelanas spoke now as they stood at Devotions in the Cathedral.<br/><br/>"I was wrong to call him back."</em><br/><br/>So many things in a handful of days that she sought to correct, and only time would tell. <br/>Her attention left that of the world of memories and considerations as she nodded to another priest entering the Cathedral. "May the Light watch over you." She spoke quietly before departing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Genevra looked up at the Citadel, attempting to recall the last time she'd set foot in Northrend only to force those memories away. She drew her cloak around her as she walked in, maybe the rumors were true, that Cyrus had holed up here to further strengthen his ties with the blade.<br/><br/>She was torn, wishing that the she would not find him here and knowing what needed to be said and done.<br/><br/>Çyrus pulls his axe from the forge, the most recent Val'Kyr souls having been fused into it. "Only a few more," Cyrus mutters.<br/><br/>Genevra paused and looked across at him, "Cyrus?" She held in her hand, the soulshard, obviously devoid of life or soul for that matter.<br/><br/>Çyrus looks at the soul. "Backing out, I assume?"<br/><br/>Genevra pushed back her hood, shifting her weight from one foot to the other. She mulled over this explanation and that before settling on , "Yes."<br/><br/>Çyrus nods. "Then you remember the consequences?"<br/><br/>"Which?"<br/><br/>"The one where I bring him back damaged."<br/><br/>"Don't waste your time Cyrus."<br/><br/>Çyrus looks at her flatly. "Oh, I won't. You made a deal with the devil, Genevra. Now fulfill your part of the bargain or risk that I really do find Eidan."<br/><br/>Genevra balked at him, pushing back her hood, "And you said the same to Narnicka then?"<br/><br/>Çyrus nods. "That was only a couple hours ago. Just missed him."<br/><br/>Genevra looked down at the soul shard, shifting it from one hand to the other. She looked from it to Cyrus and back again, before letting it slip through her fingers and fall to the floor... shattering.<br/><br/>Çyrus looks at the pieces on the floor. "Have it your way, Genevra. This deal was going to work for me, either way. I was going to get a shard or kill Eidan."<br/><br/>Genevra glared at him stepping over the shattered shard, "No, Cyrus, that's not how this is going to work. YOU don't always get your way. Not today, not with that shard, not with Eidan's life."<br/><br/><em>A faint whisper echoed in her mind, "Foolish girl...."</em><br/><br/>Çyrus chuckles. "And I suppose you're going to stop me, hm?"<br/><br/>Genevra grinned, uncharacteristically, "If I must yes. For no doubt others will fall at your hand, but those whose only failing lot in life is that they happened to be my friend and I gave a damn about them when I shouldn't have. So no, Cyrus, you'll have nothing to do with Eidan.. Ever."<br/><br/>Çyrus eyes her, his gaze piercing. the floor starts to accumulate a thin sheet of ice, which begins to move closer to her.<br/><br/>Genevra did not drop her gaze, noting the slight change in temperature was out the question, it was cold here, damn cold, one bit of cold was just as bad as the worst. "Give me your word that you will not seek him and I will leave Cyrus, and I will not bother you save to offer you a place at the table of your brother and your nephew, your business will be your own and I would have nothing to do with it." She extended her hand.<br/><br/>Çyrus holds his axe in his hand, taking a step back, so that fully extending the weapon towards her leaves the tip of the blade only an inch from her nose. "You don't seem to get it. One of the two things *you* agreed to are going to happen, like it or not."<br/><br/>Genevra quickly cast a shield around her as the weapon was within eyesight, "No Cyrus. Neither is happening. I've smashed the first and seen to the latter. You lose in this situation."<br/><br/>Çyrus grins. "Then you won't mind me going to see for myself. Besides, if Eidan is gone, I can find some other innocent druid to main in his place."<br/><br/>Genevra shook her head, "Not innocent Cyrus, one who was damned..."<br/><br/>" I'll find someone... anyone... Perhaps a mother.."

"No Cyrus I don't think you understand what I'm saying. Kill someone who is damned, destined for death already, I will point you in the right direction. You will be doing many a favor for this one is set to be hanged within a week."<br/><br/>" I frankly don't care. Either bring me a Val'Kyr soul, or your friend dies. I will kill an innocence. Your choice."<br/><br/>Genevra laughed, "I thought a soul was a soul, regardless of who it is?"<br/><br/>" True, but *you* don't see it that way. Some child will cry for a parent that's not going to return tonight, Genevra... All because you damned them..."<br/><br/>"So take a soul of the damned, who will die by the laws hands."<br/><br/>Cyrus started to walk away.<br/><br/>"STOP !"<br/><br/>Çyrus glances back. "Hm?"<br/><br/>Genevra crossed the ground between them unaware of the ice creeping up on the ground as she reached her hand around to his shoulder attempting to turn him around, "Damnit Cyrus! You'll not kill someone and blame it on me, or use my choices as an excuse to kill someone!"<br/><br/>Çyrus scoffs. "Watch me."<br/><br/>"I said No! I will stand before you and your victims for there will be NONE at my expense Cyrus."<br/><br/>Çyrus made a motion with his hands, and chains of ice burst from the ground, attempting to bind her feet and hands.<br/><br/>Genevra 's eyes shot daggers at him as she tried to reach her hand up to slap him across his face,but it was caught by the ice. "Damnit Cyrus! Don't you see what this will do to your family! Or do you and you just don't give a damn if Lahkin has any respect for his mother."<br/><br/>" Who says Lahkin has to know how much of a bastard his uncle is. This is your last chance, Genevra. Will you give me the soul of a Val'Kyr? Or will I punish an innocent on your behalf?"<br/><br/>Genevra struggled slightly against the ice bonds, "Neither is an option Cyrus, " Her eyes burned with the holy flame of retribution, "For if you touch an innocent and attempt to claim it on my behalf I will not rest until you are fallen, until your soul is suffering for the pain that you have caused others, until the victims of your blade and your actions know peace. "<br/><br/>Çyrus grins. "And explain to Narnicka that you had to kill his only remaining brother?"<br/><br/>Genevra hissed beneath her breath, "My husband is a forgiving and understanding man, who knows that you are trreading lightly. Walk away from any deal we ever had Cyrus, lest you destroy the semblance of family you have left. Lest your actions drive the brothers of Rymus from one another, or will you trade one family for another with your actions."<br/><br/>" Your husband already didn't trust you before... You robbed him off his power, yet he loves you. I wonder just how far you can push him until even he breaks... We'll see, hm?"<br/><br/>Çyrus chuckles. "The chains will fade soon. I'm off to find that... special...someone."<br/><br/>Genevra smiled at his words, which would seem out of place, "No Cyrus, we will not see, for I have seen the spark return to his eyes, and he has felt it. You are at the disadvantage."<br/><br/>Çyrus grinned as he left the Citadel, leaving Genevra to the icy chains until the spell faded.

Escalation.<br/><br/>The word resonated with Finnaeus as he strolled through Stormwind. The idle chatter of Stormwind continued well into the night - it was at times like these that he missed the quiet of his farm back in Gilneas. The city itself constantly bustled with loud chatter, the sound of hooves on the cobbled streets, and the distant call of the gryphons that stood vigil as they swooped over the city. Nothing ever came to rest. <br/><br/>Though, Finnaeus mused, neither did he. Ever since joining the Pia he kept himself constantly moving, ever preoccupied. Cyrus and his weapon proved well up to the task of keeping him busy and distracted from his own affairs, affairs that sometimes tugged on the edge of his mind like a child on her father's coat, desperate for attention. But he could afford to spare no attention for his own pursuits. Clearly fixed in his line of sight was gaining information about Cyrus and his weapon. <br/><br/>His conversations with Mithara yielded some insight on the matter. She was enlisted simply for acquiring Val'kyr souls. Cyrus had chosen a few individuals to assist him, though that raised the first pressing question for Finnaeus: why not do it himself, and limit the knowledge of his pursuits? Clearly interference and reliance on others could threaten the mission. While she had no inner knowledge of how and why Cyrus wanted what he did - the mercantile side of her was smart in not asking - she also noted how volatile Cyrus was becoming, which suggested that Finnaeus was right in assuming the weapon was affecting the Death Knight. There were many more questions, such as the actual composition of the blade, its origins, how Cyrus learned how to balm it with Val'kyr souls, but all the information pointed to the very essence of the issue: how to stop Cyrus, and how to destroy the weapon.<br/><br/>There were as many opinions on the issue as stars in the sky, but they were no closer to solving the riddle. Finnaeus suspected that Cyrus may yet be reached - his motivations were human even if his methods were not - but he also knew that they needed more information. The faster he could get his hands on more knowledge the better, because as the hostility rose and incidents of violence increased, there would be no other option but escalation. <br/><br/>

It had started with a quiet night in the Blue Recluse, sipping on some Pinot Noir and unwinding after a harsh night of training. It was supposed to be a quiet night. But then, from his small part of the Recluse, he heard a familiar voice:<br/><br/>"I have a mission for the three of you."<br/><br/>It was Cyrus. In that moment Finnaeus felt his whole body recoil. Why now? His whole life had been consumed with this Draenei's actions. But his ears instantly perked up. He listened, listened as Cyrus detailed that Rimyx was buried in Icecrown, at Corp'rethar. The burial site was marked by an axe, with an Orcish description. As the plan unfolded, Cyrus pointing towards documents, Finnaeus heard all that he needed to hear. They would be going to Northrend in two days time. He acted. He would be making the journey sooner.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>The biting cold wind howled around Finnaeus, swirling and ruffling his fur. He watched as the skeleton fell apart at his claws. He searched for hours, until finally he found the spot residing under the grim shadow of Corp'rethar's walls. The axe jutted out of the ice, half-buried under relentless snowfall. Finnaeus shifted forms, his worgen claws better suited towards penetrating the ice-bound grave and solid rock. He cricked his neck, idly wondering how he had turned into a graverobber, and he started to dig. The ice yielded nothing easily, but his worgen body did not tire. He muttered under his breath, his hands glowing green, the small parts of nature buried deep beneath the earth and ice responding, lending whatever feeble help it could grant in a land consumed by death and horror. Soon the ice gave way, and, his muscles starting to ache, Finnaeus saw the body of Rimyx, almost perfect preserved in ice.<br/><br/>Despite himself, Finnaeus gasped. The dead orc was huge. Finnaeus could not tell how long the orc lay dead, but his muscle mass looked as if he were just laid to rest. Burns, cuts, and other wounds covered his skin, evidence of the rough, militaristic lifestyle that Rimyx led as part of the Kron 5. And there, too, on his burly, beefy neck, was the tattoo of the Horde symbol, with a "five" substituting for the traditional dot. Even dead he inspired dread in Finnaeus. But he shook himself. Now was not the time to be intimidated by corpses. First he had to carry the damnable thing. <br/><br/>He spoke into his hearthstone, raising the interests of the Sepha, who he hoped enjoyed her peaceful night hosting the Troubadours. It was the last peaceful night they may have for awhile. Speaking quickly over the howling winds, he arranged for them to meet in Dalaran. Now, with a grim look at Rimyx, he had to carry the brute from Icecrown to the Violet Citadel. <br/><br/>"Claire...you would never believe this," he muttered.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>The conversation with the Sepha surprised Finnaeus - she took everything he told her in stride. Her aura of calm helped sooth his frayed nerves and exhausted body. They discussed several places to move the body, each location posing a number of risks. They conversed in writing - they had learned over time that it was never safe to assume that they weren't being watched. After all, Finnaeus thought, that is how this whole thing began for him. <br/><br/>In the end, he would leave the body to the Sepha, while he would return to the burial site to cover up his trail. Their quick meeting ended abruptly, with well-wishes for safe journies. He trusted the Sepha to place the body in a safe resting area. She carried the danger now. All Finnaeus had to do was cover up the evidence. <br/><br/>He twisted into his crow form, the howling Northrend winds carrying him inexorably towards Icecrown. It was as if the place called to him, pulling him faster than he could ever have hoped to fly there before. The ramparts of saronite came into view, the hulking gates of Corp'rethar casting a looming shadow over the sheets of ice and swirling snow. Finnaeus landed on the pinnacle, shifting back into his human form, and then descending onto the lower plane. <br/><br/>Hastily he arranged the snow and earth, replanting the axe. He surveyed the handiwork - it looked makeshift, and it would not stand up against the scrutiny of a trained eye. Perhaps it would dupe some of Cyrus's underlings into believing the Scourge had done it. Either way, the job was done, and he had to leave before -<br/><br/>"What the hell are you doing?"<br/><br/>Finnaeus closed his eyes. He didn't need to turn to know that voice.<br/><br/>It was Cyrus.

Finnaeus turned. Through the snow he saw Cyrus standing in the snow, his eyes narrowed in what Finnaeus could only describe as the most intense loathing he had ever seen. Cyrus shifted his gaze constantly between the grave and Finnaeus. Undoubtedly his mind was working overtime, putting things together.<br/><br/>"What the hell are you doing?"<br/><br/>"The same thing as you, I imagine," Finnaeus said, hastily arranging his face in a look of calm disinterest. He became keenly aware that in the land of the frozen wastes, Cyrus held a great advantage should things come to blows. It would not end well for Finn to fight him here. "Perhaps you should have come sooner?"<br/><br/>"Where is he?" <br/><br/>"I do not know," Finnaeus said, a half-truth that he had no guilt in giving Cyrus. "Perhaps he is walking among the dead now."<br/><br/>"Where did you take him," Cyrus growled, his eyes glinting with malevolent power. Finnaeus saw Cyrus's arm twitching and undulating with power, and he knew he did not have much time. <br/><br/>"I did not take him anywhere," Finnaeus responded. That, he mused, was an outright lie, but a necessary one. Cyrus was dangerous, and to give away Rimyx would be to undo all of their efforts here.<br/><br/>"You do not have many options here," Cyrus snarled. "Tell me where he is!"<br/><br/>"I do not know," Finnaeus responded. That, however, broke the dam. Cyrus lashed forward, unleashing a ferocious blast of cold. Instinctively Finnaeus twisted, transforming into a bear, taking the edge off of the blast but still suffering from the massive cold. His body shivered uncontrollably. With another snarl Cyrus dashed forward, his weapon raised. Finnaeus twisted again, becoming a human, and he whirled his hands. Feeble roots sprouted from the earth, tangling Cyrus's feet and hands. The roots were no match; the icey power of Cyrus's fury froze them over. Finnaeus leapt, turned into a crow, soared over Cyrus, and then landed on the other side of the Death Knight. <br/><br/>"Tell me where is or I will kill you," Cyrus raged, his fury erupting in icy waves from his body. <br/><br/>"Think of what you're doing," Finnaeus yelled back, turning into his worgen form. He roared at Cyrus. There was no fear in Cyrus's gaze, only unbridled rage. <br/><br/>"I am bringing my friend back!" Cyrus roared. "Where is the body?!"<br/><br/>"Have a meeting with us," Finnaeus said. "We can come to a peaceful solution."<br/><br/>"A peaceful solution? You are a grave robber! The only solution is you telling me where he is."<br/><br/>"That I cannot do," Finnaeus said. "See reason, Cyrus."<br/><br/>"I will burn Hearthglen to the ground if I have to," Cyrus snapped. <br/><br/>"And risk burning your precious comrade's body? Or worse, burn the very building that your daughter sleeps in?"<br/><br/>"Do not lecture me about my daughter," Cyrus snarled.<br/><br/>"Think of the cost of what you are doing!" Finnaeus snarled back. "There is meaning in death, Cyrus; without death there is no meaning to what we do here. What would life be, if we could simply wave our hands and undo the past? Or have you forgotten all of that having died yourself!"<br/><br/>"This body gives me the strength to do what others cannot," Cyrus sneered.<br/><br/>"You call this strength? It is not strength that you possess when you are desperate to raise your fallen comrade. You have been bested by your grief."<br/><br/>"NOTHING BESTS ME! NOT EVEN DEATH!" Cyrus screamed. Finnaeus saw the Death Knight's body trembling with rage and fury. Talented as he was as a druid, Finnaeus would not be able to stand toe to toe with Cyrus and live to tell the tale. Perhaps not in the North. Perhaps not anywhere, yet. Though he did not fear death, Finnaeus had an obligation to warn the Sepha.<br/><br/>"Enjoy the land of the dead, Cyrus," Finnaeus said, glaring at Cyrus. "Get used to it." <br/><br/>Finnaeus turned, the wind carrying his body upwards into the air, watching as the Death Knight screamed into the dead winter's night.<br/><br/>"I DON'T CARE WHO I HAVE TO KILL! I WILL BRING HIM BACK!"

((Sorry for the late reserve, this IC'ly comes before Finn's post.))<br/><br/>Punches had been thrown before, Ciellia knew this. But this time was different. Cyrus had not started the attack. This time, he had been attacked and now many were joining in to help "overthrow" the draenei.. Ciellia emerged from the shadows rumbling with a growl, her eyes fixed onto one person. Mithara. Ciellia had warned her about the consequences of attacking Cyrus and now it was time to follow through without question.<br/><br/>Mithara turned the blade from the back of Cyrus' neck to point at Lia.<br/><br/>"Ya' know.. Just told Kaellar I wouldn't touch you if you backed off. Don't touch him again." <br/><br/>A simple grunt in response? Did she think that would make the feline back off? <br/><br/>"Kae knows I don't do that well. Besides, I'm just keeping Gentyl from getting squished."<br/><br/>Lia ducked the weapon and growled, lunging forward to swipe at Mithara's stomach with her claws. "Not by hurting him." Mithara clung on to the back of Cyrus, Lia got close again, rumbling with a growl. "BACK OFF." This time, for one reason or another, Mithara did back off and took a step back, looking down at her reopened scars.<br/><br/>The fight had drifted outside and by the time Ciellia re-appeared Mithara was readying her sedative-laced blade. Lia leaped past Cyrus and slammed her head into Mithara, to knock her off-balance. Lia had her pinned, could have ripped into her skin as if it was nothing. But she didn't, she held back. A friend.. Sarapis, kept trying to tell Lia and Mithara to stop; although Lia wanted nothing more than to rid her family of this nuisance, Lia stepped back, allowing Mithara up.<br/><br/>Before Lia had time to move, Mithara raised a hoof and kicked her in the head. The blow was direct, right between Ciellia's ears. A small cracking sound was heard along with a painful groan as Lia was pushed back, by the force of the kick, to Cyrus' side. The Watch began to file in as Lia was kicked, minutes after the impact, she began to feel the pain as she sunk down to lay at Cyrus' side.<br/><br/>Thankfully, Lia would be fine. The wrath of Cyrus would be held off for a little longer. An friend of the Ocheliad had appeared and set to work fixing the small crack and stitching Lia back together so she could fight again another day.<br/>

<em>They descended upon him unmercifully. <br/><br/>The various members of the Lluchduu Ocheliad had been laying in wait outside the Pia Presidium compound, hoping one would stray down the path for a walk. As fate would have it, Ulthryn came down, looking like something had been on his mind. Yet, now, all that lay on his mind is Valtherimas' boot as he was blind-sided by Slithengar. Ulthryn had been able to get out, "Help! Ocheli-" into his hearhstone before he'd been taken down.<br/><br/>Ardam, Paden, Slithengar, Valtherimas, Aziriel, Jalou and Cyrus had ambushed the paladin, taking him as their prisoner. Their tabards all began to glow faintly, meaning they were being summoned. Cyrus reached down, grasping Ulthryn's shirt to drag him along through the teleportation to Deadwind Pass.</em><br/><br/>Cyrus opened his eyes, having gotten too comfortable in his seat at the Recluse. A very impatient Gentyl stood before him, having been called here by Cyrus. Behind her were Valtherimas and Slithengar. "Hm... That was fast," He muttered under his breath. Cyrus lifted Ulthryn's weapon above the table, letting it clatter down onto the wooden tabletop. Gentyl had put two and two together. Between the yell into Ulthryn's hearthstone and the weapon, it was clear what had happened.<br/><br/>"Where is he?" Gentyl asked pointedly.<br/><br/>"I warned you, Gentyl. I told you what would happen if you didn't hand over Rimyx's body. Now Ulthryn has become Ardam's latest amusement. Though, knowing him, I'd say your paladin has a survival timer of what...." He glanced at Paden, "Twenty minutes?" Paden had considered for a moment, finally shaking his head and placing a boot on the table.<br/><br/>Ulthryn's boot, and it had a foot in it.<br/><br/>Gentyl visibly paled in unison with a stifled sigh from Cyrus. "Jeez, Commander, you could have at least waited until she refused to hand over the body before giving her a heart attack," He muttered. Despite the obvious trick designed to shock her from Paden, Gentyl maintained her reserve, again insisting.<br/><br/>"Cyrus, I don't even know if he's alive. Take me to him, or I'll burn the body," She said adamently. After a few moments of thinking it over, Cyrus' tabard began to glow again, meaning Imperon was either anxious or impatient. Or just wanted to speak with Gentyl himself. Likely the last one. Again, the present company was summoned to Deadwind Pass.<br/><br/>Gentyl immediately moved to Ulthryn's side. The prisoner had been beaten badly, but it all seemed to be cosmetic damage. He'd taken a hoof to the jaw, and his feet had been prodded with red-hot pokers by Vanesse. Even despite that pain, he tried to get Gentyl to leave. At least, that's what Cyrus had guessed it was. <br/><br/>It had come out, "Entyl.. eave... ease..." Gentyl hushed Ulthryn, trying to keep him from provoking the Ocheliad any further. Despite being bound on the ground, the persistent paaldin had been spitting and spewing very Ocheliad-like language at them. Then again, who could blame him?<br/><br/>Gentyl walked out of the gathered Ocheliad group to speak with Imperon. Cyrus hadn't been able to hear exactly what was said, but it was a rather lengthy conversation. Going off what he could hear, Gentyl felt betrayed and disgusted that Imperon would advocate such a tactic, yet Imperon had a clear arguement. Gentyl's group had stolen the body of Rimyx Ragelust to prevent Cyrus from raising him once again. Gentyl was clearly growing frustrated with whatever Imperon had been saying, and whistled sharply, summoning her gryphon. The winged beast descended, smoothly letting Gentyl swing onto its back.<br/><br/>The gryphon puffed out its chest and gave out a rather confident "Awk!" at Imperon. Gentyl reigned in her mount, however, and she was off into the dim light. Cyrus looked at Imperon, wondering what had happened. <br/><br/>"She's going to retrieve the body of your friend, Captian," Imperon said, as if reading Cyrus' thoughts. On rare occasion, he wondered if Imperon could. The Ocheliad that were still gathered around Ulthryn continued to taunt and abuse him, but it was teaching a leasson. Those who crossed the Ocheliad did not do so without a penalty.

Watching his comrades continue their treatment of the bound paladin, Cyrus waited patiently for Gentyl to return, and just when he became impatient to the point of being irritable, she returned. This time, she'd flown in on her drake so that she could carry the body of Rimyx on the back.<br/><br/>Cyrus immediately closed the distance between them, helping the body down. This was the first time Cyrus had seen Rimyx since the day he died, but it was exactly as he remembered.<br/><br/>Rimyx was a large, brown-skin orc. Various scars on his body gave away he'd led a violent life, but the tell-tale sign was the tattoo on the side of his neck. It was the Horde symbol, but the traditional dot had been replaced with a small <em>"5"</em>. Cyrus glanced at Imperon, nodding the confirmation.<br/><br/>Upon seeing it, Imperon looked at Gentyl. "He's all yours, Lady Gentyl. We have what we came for." Upon those words being spoken, Cyrus picked up the body and whistled sharply. A drake descended, allowing Cyrus to pull Rimyx onto the back and fly off. The various Ocheliad dispersed, leaving Gentyl to tend to her wounded man. <br/><br/>The only question that remained was what had this event changed? Pia Presidium had robbed the grave of Cyrus' fallen comrade and the Ocheliad had abducted one of their members. <br/><br/>Things weren't going to cool down for a long time after this...

There had now been two meetings in regards to Shauraria's safety, but neither had put Ciellia's mind at ease. The first meeting had included a handful of people, it only led to bickering and fighting, and causing great amounts of stress. The second meeting had just been Ciellia, Catrella, and Cray. This second meeting helped Ciellia's mind, but it put her in great danger.<br/><br/>She did not hide the fact that she did not like this weapon, Cyrus had heard her opinion on it loud and clear. However, no ill befell her. A plan had been hatched. She knew how to prevent everyone coming to more blows, but she knew the risk it would put on her if she acted against Cyrus. She still had faith in him. He still maintained control over the cursed weapon. Precautions had to be taken incase she fell. <br/><br/>After a short conversation with Sykes ((Desmend)), Ciellia had decided her course of action. She obtained a shard and a runestone. She found the spells that were needed and placed an enchantment on the stone. If she had done everything properly, all it would take is <strong>this</strong> shard being made into the weapon. Both the runestone with directions and the shard were incased in a box and hidden. Only Shauraria knew where it was hidden. And the runestone would not activate unless Ciellia died.<br/><br/>Only one request was made, to Sykes. "If I fall to his axe. Tell Ria to go hide."

Hostilities were getting worse between Pia and Imperon's men. Finn had taken the body and Gentyl had reburied it at Light's Hope Chapel. She was the only one who knew where the body was, but that was enough when they captured Ulthryn. <br/><br/>Gentyl stormed into the Recluse after they confirmed Ulthryn was gone. She was sure they would be waiting for her and they were.<br/><br/>The wrangling and dodging ended when Paden put Ulthryn's boot on the table. Inside was a severed foot.<br/><br/>"That's not his," she said with more confidence than she felt.<br/><br/>"Of course it is," Paden replied. "Turn over the body and you can have the rest of him."<br/><br/>"Don't turn it over and you'll get back a corpse to go with the one you stole," Cyrus said.<br/><br/>"If I get back a corpse, I'll invite you to a ceremony and you can watch me scatter your friend's ashes on the wind. Try resurrecting ashes."<br/><br/>"You wouldn't do that."<br/><br/>"Watch me."<br/><br/>They finally agreed to let her see Ulthryn. He had been tortured, but he was alive and still had two feet.<br/><br/>There was no choice in the matter. If she guessed right, Cyrus was already on the verge of insanity, not that Imperon in his arrogance cared. Imperon was convinced his men were under control, but Ardam was stark proof that they either weren't or Imperon condoned some horrendous acts that made him even worse than Ardam.<br/><br/>It was a shock to her. In her own, naive way she had felt Imperon wasn't really as bad as many people thought. She had crashed straight into the truth and it hurt worse than a brick wall. <br/><br/>Imperon was worse than the monster Ardam.<br/>

After a conversation with Desmend, Ria had decided she was done with people trying to ensure her safety. It was time for her to ensure the safety of others. She had mentioned her idea to Gentyl, but was told that it would endanger herself.<br/><br/>"I'll think about it."<br/><br/>There was a glimmer of hope for her insane plot after all. In the morning she talked to her mom, Ciellia, and returned the shard. <br/><br/>"Mom, if they let me, dad will be coming to visit me in Hearthglen... Can you help me end all this? Please.. I want everything back to the way they were, back to normal."<br/><br/>Ciellia simply nodded in response and took the shard. She knew just how much they both were risking, but they had to do it.<br/><br/>----------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Later that evening Ria was given permission to follow through with her plan. Cyrus -never- had the weapon with him and with him occupied visiting Ria, it would allow Ciellia enough time to forge on the holy-infused shard.<br/><br/>She pulled out her hearthstone and took a deep breath as she looked for the confidence she needed. "Dad... Can you and the cub come up to visit me?"<br/><br/>"Sure.. You okay?"<br/><br/>"Yeah. I'm fine. Just as lonely here as I was in the woods. But here everyone keeps asking if I'm okay. Kinda like you and mom do.. but they don't mean it the same way."<br/><br/>"I'm on my way."<br/><br/>When he arrived, there was plenty to talk about. He had brought the cub she gave to Ciellia and him, "Alitae". They both joked and smiled and laughed. Although shortly interrupted, neither of them minded. Before Cyrus left, he had some words with Gentyl, although from where Ria stood, it did not seem heated. Before he left to return to the Tower, he came back to get the cub.<br/><br/>Bending over to ruffle Ria's hair, "Gonna need the cub back. Lia's a bit... attached."<br/><br/>Ria looked down at the cub who immediately began to scramble up Cyrus' legplates and tabard. "Uh... You sure Alitae isn't *attached* to you?"<br/><br/>He scooped up the cub and placed him in a satchel over his shoulder. As he began to leave, the cub peaked out at Ria. "Stay safe, Ria."<br/><br/>"You too, Dad!"<br/><br/>----------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>After Cyrus left, Taelanas came over to Ria. Although, she feigned happiness about the two remaining cubs decently, she eventually came clean about the emotions flooding her heart and mind.<br/><br/>"Do you think he'll be okay... when he goes to finish the weapon and won't work?"<br/><br/>"He may be angry..."<br/><br/>"But the axe *does* change his personality.. Without it he might be back to normal, right? I hope he is..."<br/><br/>Taelanas smiled. "When I first heard about this, back when he threatened Genevra's and Eidan's souls, Lia was my first hope at stoping this. I had hoped she would do something of the sort before it got this far however."<br/><br/>"She told me about the nightmare that she had... that made her confront my dad and figure out how to end all this. I think it really scared her."<br/><br/>Afterwards there were a few apologies for how the entire situation had been handled. Ria understood the reasoning, she felt no need or reason to hold a grudge. They acted the same way she would have, if it had been anyone else. It was clear to all around her, that she was still nervous.. All she wanted was for both her parents to be okay at the end of all of this.

Ciellia knew she didn't have much time to act, an hour at most. She made her way to the weapon rack in the closet her and Cyrus shared. Even with all the care she put into picking up the axe, she heaved at its weight. Perhaps it was just that heavy or perhaps she was feeling the burden he was carrying.<br/><br/>She moved as quickly as she could through the halls and out into the druid Grove on the Ocheliad lands. She had no skill with forging, but she had a careful eye. After examining the axe from every angle, even made a couple of sketches, she began to forge the holy-infused shard into the weapon. Minutes passed as she worked the weapon, with those minutes slowly crept into her was a great fear... The nightmare she had a few nights prior.<br/><br/>She was NOT going to lose Cyrus to this weapon. Nor was she going to lose the future they might have.. But she was willing to risk the later in order to keep many others out of harm's way, most importantly, her daughter.<br/><br/>After carefully returning the weapon to their closet, she jotted down a quick note.<br/><br/><em>Many traditions were broken when I met you. Proof that they aren't everything. I went to Moonglade to clear my mind, will be back before dawn.</em>

Things had moved very quickly over the course of the night. Gentyl drew Paden away from the Blue Recluse and then..... they attacked. It had been a vicious fight, leaving wounds on most of those involved. Cray had avoided the brunt of it -- knocking back Paden's ghouls -- but he'd blocked one of Paden's own blows towards one of his allies with the nearest thing he could think of.... his own chest.<br/><br/>It hurt. A lot. But Cray hadn't let it distract him from the battle at hand. He'd taken harder blows in battle and ended up victorious. So the fight raged on until finally Paden -- wounded, outnumbered, and probably exhausted, collapsed to the ground. Flying mounts were called out of the sky and the group was off through Booty Bay, to Kalimdor.<br/><br/>Eventually they brought Paden to a holding cell, hidden away on an island off of Dustwallow Marsh, and Mira set about healing everyone. Xytan had taken the brunt of Paden's Death Knight abilities, Taelanas had taken the brunt of the ghouls' attacks. Paden himself needed a great deal of healing. Eidan, Cray, and Gentyl sought to tend to their prisoner...<br/><br/>...and that was when the Ocheliad showed up. The Sepha and her knight left the cell, Cray asking Zherron not to kill the prisoner unless the Holy Guards were killed. He recognized some in their number as soon as he entered the next room -- Cyrus, of course. Ciellia -- who Cray was surprised had not come up with a reason not to be there. And Imperon Showdah himself.<br/><br/>Noises suddenly alerted him -- some of the Ocheliad had made it inside the cell. Both Cray and Cyrus made to move towards the cell door -- for different reasons of course. Cyrus had a larger stride and made it to the door faster.... there was only one thing for it.<br/><br/>"I think you and I should have one of our chats." Cray said coldly. Much like the last chat, there was water covering their feet in the flooded dungeon. The difference being that this time, Cray knew what was coming.<br/><br/>"I do love chats." Cyrus answered.<br/><br/>Ria was not going to be happy with him if she found out about this. Cray hurled his fist towards, Cyrus' face. Punching seemed to be the traditional for the little bouts between the two warriors. Might as well open with a classic. Cyrus was ready, and dodged the blow while drawing his weapon. He swung it -- a harmless warning rather than an attack, but Cray stepped back to avoid it anyhow. And then, he charged.<br/><br/>As a warrior, for most of his life, Cray had depended on weapons. As much as those could be helpful, any skilled warrior could disarm another. There were countless ways to do it. And so Cray had learned to use many seemingly innocent things as weapons -- a chair, a spoon, a flagon. As a Paladin, however, Cray had learned that he himself was an even more powerful weapon of the Light. This gave him an advantage that he was more than ready to take advantage of this time....<br/><br/>Golden glowing wings emerged from Cray's back as he forced himself to channel as much Light as he could manage, throwing his hands forwards towards Cyrus as he charged. Cyrus -- as expected -- met the charge by grabbing Cray and lifting him into the air. The Draenei seemed love to take advantage of the size difference. Cray latched onto Cyrus' arms, smirking a bit as his feet dangled above the water, and then he pushed.<br/><br/>All of the Light energy Cray had summoned, the wings included, Cray forced through his hands into Cyrus. This sort of close-up exorcism was a new idea, but he hoped the effect would be devastating.<br/><br/>And perhaps it would have been if it hadn't be so forceful. Cyrus tossed Cray backwards as he himself was thrown backwards. Managing to land on his feet, the Paladin drew his sword. Cyrus was pressed up against the cell door. The blessed blade aimed at the Draenei's chest.<br/><br/>"Go back to your lord," Cray ordered, "And stay next to him."<br/><br/>Imperon, having a pleasant discussion with Sepha Gentyl, told her that Cray needed to drop his weapon. He didn't plan to oblige the lord of the Ocheliad, but if it meant saving lives.... hesitantly, he lowered the sword... keeping it at the ready while making himself seem less threatening to those not well-versed in his history of combat.<br/><br/>And then, the advantage shifted. From nowhere, something.... nuzzled into his back... and Cyrus, in one swift motion, drew his axe -- the axe at the heart of all this -- and brought it down on Cray's shoulder. His shoulderguards did their job, keeping his arm from being cut at all, but the plate mail cracked under the blow and Cray crumpled to the ground, dropping his sword in the water. Before he could recover himself, Cyrus launched another attack. Cray rolled to avoid it, managing to get himself cornered against the wall.

((continued))<br/><br/>Turnabout was fair play, as they said. Cray had started with the advantage but -- as his father had often warned him about -- coming off too strong too soon was often the surest way to fail. Cyrus launched a hoof at Cray's chest, landing squarely where Paden had hit him earlier. He cough, sputtered, and grabbed ahold of the Draenei's withdrawing hoof. With a quick murmur, he consecrated it. Usually those words were uttered to consecrate ground, it was effective at handling groups of demons or undead. He'd never consecrated a being before, and he had little idea of what it might do. A spiderweb of golden light began to extend from Cray's hand, however, in much the same way it would extend across the ground.<br/><br/>Cyrus was clearly in pain, freezing his own leg in ice to stop the spread. Another success.... but not enough to regain the advantage, not with his breath leaving him. And now Cray feared he was out of moves to play.... he had nothing left for it but to pray.<br/><br/>((This is as best as I remember the fight. Other people gonna have to write up the rest of it, because I have to go batten down the hatches for the hurricane now.))

Many had attended Val and Ulthryn's honor duel... Minutes seemed to last forever once Val fell. The call was made, Ulthryn had won. Ciellia and Cerdiwyn rushed to his side along with many other Ocheliad and on-lookers. An Ocheliad mage had pulled him through a portal to the Tower where he was sent to the infirmary. Cerdiwyn and Ciellia worked to stabilize Val and they did... But at the cost of exhausting themselves. <br/><br/>Ciellia retired to her room in the Tower to rest. She drifted into a nap for hours. By the time she awoke it was dark out, but that did not startle her. She left the comfort of her room and began to look around... Cyrus had not returned. <br/><br/>The next day it had been confirmed, he had been snatched. Her heart dropped in her chest. She whisked herself out of the Tower and to Moonglade. She knew what she wanted to do, the feral instinct that had been pushing her to strike out at those who harmed her family. But she went to seek guidance.<br/><br/>She knew there would be a force of Ocheliad sent to retrieve him. She was going to be ready to go with. The proper spells were needed. She needed to protect herself more than in the past. Each attack she intended to make HAD to be more precise than ever before, each heal stronger and draining her less. Claws dug into the earth as she said a quiet prayer. Teleporting back to the Tower she began to strap on her armor, tightening each latch and buckle twice.<br/><br/>Now she just awaited the orders to be given.

((This happened when Cyrus came to see Ria.))<br/><br/>Finnaeus narrowed his eyes at the sight of Cyrus. Gentyl had agreed he could come visit Ria at their headquarters, but it didn't make anyone happy.<br/><br/>Çyrus looked among the three and waited.<br/><br/>"You understand we have to search you," Gentyl said as she dismounted. Valor promptly dropped his head to graze as soon as she stepped away, but he moved with her, as he had been trained to do. She could be back on him in an instant if need be. <br/><br/>Cyrus nodded and waited while she searching him for weapons. It wasn't lost on her he towered over her and could have easily reached out and grabbed her by the throat, crushed the gorget around it if he wanted. For that reason, men were in position above him with crossbows trained on him. He might bring her down, but he would go also. He wasn't stupid. Satisfied he was unarmed, she motioned him in. Finnaeus reluctantly stepped aside and Taelanas turned his horse to follow Cyrus.<br/><br/>Gentyl mounted and wheeled Valor around. "You may pass. I think she's in the stable."<br/><br/>Çyrus nodded, not saying a word and looking in the direction Gentyl had pointed him.<br/><br/>They had already agreed Cyrus and Ria could visit in private, so the three returned to the keep where they could keep an eye on the two and still remain out of earshot.<br/><br/>Kixek looked up. "So, um, has everything, Been alright..? That man, on the dragon, was talking about the uh, Recluse."<br/><br/>"Everything?" Elise said. "That's a bit too broad. Yes he was, I don't know him but Sepha seemed to and so did Taelanas."<br/><br/>"Who is that?" Gentyl asked, still watching Cyrus. Of course, if he did go berserk, they wouldn't be able to save Ria, but they kept watch anyay.<br/><br/>Elisienne turned at the voice and smiled up at Gentyl, "Z... I believe you called him?"<br/><br/>Taelanas shrugged. "Close enough. He was here to discuss a job keeping peace at the Recluse." He looked around at the small group. "No sense waiting here, when we can sit down in my house. It's close enough to the stable."<br/><br/>They followed him to the house where he immediately started rummaging around the hearth looking for food. Taelanas was always hungry and he assumed everyone else was also. <br/><br/>"I know I shouldn't worry about her," Gentyl said.<br/><br/>"But you are," Finnaeus replied. <br/><br/>She didn't try to deny it. "Yes."<br/><br/>"It's understandable...if that were my daughter...I'd worry too. How much of him is the man that swore to be her father?"<br/><br/>"I think he means well, but if the weapon controls him is anyone safe?"<br/><br/>"No. Which is why it must be destroyed. We were wrong in thinking that taking the body would do any good. The weapon is the source of this misery."<br/><br/>Baridin clapped his hands on his legs. "Oh the weapon! I had a plan! ....I don't remember my plan...."<br/><br/>Gentyl blinked.<br/><br/>Finnaeus cracked a smile at Baradin who was about two and a half sheets to the wind.<br/><br/>Taelanas crowed in victory. "I have some oatmeal on the boil if anyone needs something to fill their stomach!"<br/><br/>Gentyl gagged. She had never been able to tolerate the smell or site of oatmeal since her incarceration at the death camp.<br/><br/>Baridin looked thoughtful, "What was my plan?"<br/><br/>"I wish you could remember it," Gentyl said, pulling a sachet out of her pocket to cover the scent of the cooking oatmeal.<br/><br/>Baridin sighed. "That's the last time I drink that special reserve around planning something."<br/><br/>"It's a testament to our organization that we don't simply jump the Death Knight like they did to Ulthryn," Finnaeus said.<br/><br/>Taelanas smiled. "Order Finn. Our Order."<br/><br/>Finnaeus nods in deferment to Taelanas.<br/><br/>"Aye, but, I'm ok without the testament," Baridin said with a smile. "Let's get him!"<br/><br/>Finnaeus picked at something on his sleeve. "Did the time bought by moving the body yield any information?"<br/><br/>"Yes," Gentyl replied. "Imperon is a ruthless bastage."<br/><br/>"We should have burned it," Taelanas remarked<br/><br/>"A what?" Baridin asked.<br/><br/>Finnaeus responded. "The man who keeps these monsters on a rather loose leash. Cyrus...Ardam... How much longer can we brook their madness?"<br/><br/>Baridin says: Aye, but...bastage?<br/><br/>Finnaeus stared at the dwarf. "Shouldn't you be remembering that plan?"<br/><br/>"A fatherless son," Gentyl replied.<br/><br/>Baridin resumed pulling at his beard. "Aye, the plan." He waved a dismissive hand, "I'll remember a better plan."<br/>

"So...Imperon approves of Cyrus and his weapon?" Finnaeus said, not really expecting a response. "Should we check on the girl?"<br/><br/>Baridin brightened up. "With the spyglasses?"<br/><br/>Finnaeus looked surprised. "You have spyglasses?"<br/><br/>"Aye, I was asked to make a few."<br/><br/>"I'd like to purchase one of these spyglasses if you have any available."<br/><br/>"Ye'll have ta talk ta Taelanas. He wants them fer somethin."<br/><br/>Taelanas held out a spyglass.<br/><br/>"How much, sir?" Finneaus asked.<br/><br/>"They are for the Presidium."<br/><br/>"So free?" the dwarf seemed incredulous. "Or large discount?"<br/><br/>"Yes, free to any who have need for one."<br/><br/>Finnaeus smiled. "Ah, indeed. Thank you. Gilnean habit - gifts were often seen as suspicious. Being squired to Desmend means employing every trick of the trade."<br/><br/>Baridin chuckled. "Eh, same with dwarves, we like ta pay or work fer whatever we get. Baridin rummaged through his pack to find a spyglass.<br/><br/>Finnaeus put his hand on the dwarf's arm. "Never fear master Baradin...Taelanas has given me one."<br/>Baridin humphed. "Oh...well...in that case, I will not fear."<br/><br/>They jumped up and ran out at the sound of alarms. Ehlina stood close to Cyrus and Ria. Taelanas glanced at Cyrus, obviously concerned the man would think it a breach of the agreement.<br/><br/>"I said they would have privacy," Gentyl said.<br/><br/>"Fair enough. I'll wait my turn," Ehlina said.<br/><br/>Baridin looked around at the people, fingering his gun.<br/><br/>"Because the Presidium is oath bound to honor our member's right to meeting her Father.<br/><br/>"Let them visit," Gentyl said.<br/><br/>"Came to talk to you, Lady Gentyl, anyway."<br/><br/>Ehlina stared at Cyrus. "Father?? Alright then. Not even gonna ask."<br/><br/>"Adoped," Taelanas explained as they walked back to his house. "Hungry Ma'am?<br/><br/>"Just a quick question," Ehlina said. "How much help does the Presidium want with the Ocheliad?"<br/><br/>Taelanas offered cinnamon oatmeal tot he guest.<br/><br/>"No thank you."<br/><br/>"Baridin?<br/><br/>"No thank ye, lad."<br/><br/>Taelanas nodded ad dug into the massive bowl of oatmeal. "As much as we can get I would think."<br/><br/>"I might be able to gather a couple of armies," Ehlina said. <br/><br/>Taelanas looked up. "Who?"<br/><br/>Ehlina continued. "The question is for it to work properly the Presidium might have to be a little deceitful."<br/><br/>"We need fifteen people and I think we have five committed," Gentyl said.<br/><br/>Ehlina looked incredulous. "Fifteen according to what?"<br/>"Sepha, we will need more than fifteen," Taelanas said. "It might not even come to bloodshed if we have an overwhelming force. They are not stupid. Just.... stupid."<br/>

"Fifteen is all we can field. It will be enough to get that weapon away from Cyrus."<br/><br/>"We can field whoever we want," Taelanas persisted.<br/><br/>"I'm sure we could find a way to equip more than fifteen people," Baridin said.<br/><br/>Ehlina held up her hand. "Actually the deception would be drawing them into open conflict. Just get them on open ground and that will be all that's needed. Even if the battle is with the fifteen I can guarantee the LO will be decimated once that fight is over."<br/><br/>"What do ye have in mind? Cannons?" The dwarf was getting excited now.<br/><br/>Gentyl shook her head. "I don't want to lure them into a trap."<br/><br/>"Fifteen might draw them in, but to only count on fifteen souls is insane," Taelanas said.<br/><br/>"Grim Maw, Isnhu and even the Da Doctas," Ehlina said. "They will overrun the LO and do whatever they want with their corpses."<br/><br/>"Imperon isn't stupid. They will flee if they are overwhelmed."<br/><br/>At that moment a knock sounded on the door. Taelanas held up his hand to halt the conversation. Cyrus waited outside.<br/><br/>"Gentyl have a ... moment?" he asked.<br/><br/>"Yes, sir."<br/><br/>Çyrus nodded off to his right to a nearby tree. Gentyl looked up to the rampart where the sun glinted off a crossbow she knew was trained on Cyrus.<br/><br/>Çyrus paused for a moment, as if trying to figure out how to say something. Finally he said softly. "Thanks, Gentyl."<br/><br/>"Cyrus, she misses you."<br/><br/>He looked off to the right. "Yea, I know..."<br/><br/>"A daughter shouldn't have to be separated from her parents and I hope the fences will be mended soon...but frankly, I don't trust you right now."<br/><br/>He looked down at her. "Gentyl, I was the one who had her sent back here."<br/><br/>She nodded. "I know that and I appreciate it. I think neither you nor Imperon realize what effect that weapon could have on you?"<br/><br/>Çyrus sighed. "I know the weapon is affecting me, Gentyl. I'm not a fool. I--...<br/><br/>"What would it take for you to give up your quest for this weapon? I can raise money."<br/><br/>Çyrus considered her question. "To hell with money, power and prestige...<br/> I want my teacher back."<br/><br/>"I will even do what it takes to try and bring your friend back. Let us help you bring your friend back in return for you abandoning the weapon. Will Imperon want the weapon for other reasons?"<br/><br/>Cyrus shook his head. "Me having it is enough for him."<br/><br/>"I was told earlier there is a chance you could control other death knights or scourge with it. That kind of power would appeal to Imperon."<br/><br/>"Who told you that?"<br/><br/>"It was in an intelligence report."<br/><br/>"Gentyl, to be honest, I don't know what else this weapon is going to enable me to do. All I care about is that Rimyx will be back."<br/><br/>"Will Imperon give up the search for the weapon? Imperon's not the one searching for the weapon."<br/><br/>"I'm finishing it of my own volition."<br/><br/>Gentyl looked around the grounds. She loved it here and had nightmares about it being turned into a battlefield. "Well, forgive me, but I got the message loud and clear that Imperon has a very strong interest in it to the point he would kill my men."<br/><br/>"If we intended to thin your ranks, we would have."<br/><br/>"Yes, I keep getting told how we have no power against you and, as everyone so charmingly puts it, I am only alive because Imperon suffers me to live. But back to the question. Will Imperon object if you abandon the weapon."<br/><br/>Çyrus shook his head. "It is my choice. It wouldn't be like him to try and run my own personal goals."<br/><br/>"Then will you abandon it if we help you bring your friend back?<br/>
