Illisidel Lightsun sat in the study of his home his flute in his hands, his eyes stained with tears, he took a deep breath before opening his mouth, and began singing.<br/><br/>((http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY9dQ8hUi7U))<br/><br/>After the words he brought the flute to his lips to finish out the song, tears running down his face. This song held so many good, and horrible memories for the paladin, it had been his units battle hymn in Northrend. Though the song could be enterpreted many different ways, they had interpreted it as a song of hope that the darkness no matter how much it spread would eventually be defeated, and fade away. It was the song on their lips when his unit had marched into their final battle, a battle only he had escaped from, with a sever injury he had never fully recovered from. Part of him wondered if it was all in his head, numerous medical professionals had told him he could return to the field, but the paladin believed seeing all of his comrades die around him, because of his mistake, had scarred his mind. Tears dripped on the paper causing the ink to run as he began writing in his journal.<br/><br/><em> Tonight couldn't have gone better, our audition for the Cirque was received well, and they even said they were already preparing a time where we could perform. I was worried Kass was not going to make it, but she showed up just in time, I believe Mina said it best when she said, "It wouldn't have been the same without you." I couldn't have agreed more, though I would have felt the same if Mina had been the one arriving at the last minute, or even Rivi, none of it would have been the same if any of us had been a no show. Afterward we sat around and talked, with Leon, and Zael, two high ranking members of the Cirque, the others passed a flask of alcohol around. <br/><br/>Kass tried to get me to have some, even going so far as to brush her hand over mine, thinking that would change my mind, at least that is what I figured she was doing. Still I refused, and we went back to enjoying the evening, eventually Leon, and Zael left, leaving the four of us alone, and typically Rivi began to act the fool. What Kass, and Mina see in him is beyond me, he is claerly a playboy a man who would hit on any beautiful woman, and whether they know this fact or not, they're teasing simply condones his behavior. I fear one, if not both of them may get hurt if things continue like this, but being the voice of reason when those three are together is like talking to a wall, they just don't listen. All of them kept saying I should lighten up, even Kass after the other two had left, even though she was not being playful anymore said I should lighten up, and smile more.<br/><br/>This is why tears stain these pages, when they said those things my mind whirled back to the past, to Northrend, to the parties my unit, and I had after a major victory. To the smiles, the laughter, the light drinking, it was during one of these times I made the mistake that got them all killed. I swore then I would never again let happiness cloud my judgement, never again would I break the rules of my order, even a little. If the others see me as a stick in the mud, or a stuffed shirt, then so be it, someone has to set limits, has to be the voice of reason. Though this view has lost me many good friends, both from Northrend, and at home, the only one who seems able to put up with it is the human death knight Dalfein Scourgebane, he is the only one I have kept in slight contact with from Northrend.<br/><br/>I will not make a mistake like that again, but th eothers do not need to know about this, so I will continue as I have, I am supposed to meet Kass tomorrow to help her with a song she has been working on. I gladly help, because it is only when I play, and get lost in the music can I forget, and be happy.</em>

I have never been able to resist a challenge. <br/><br/>Even as a child my singing teacher would give me a hard piece to sing and dare me to be able to sing it for him at our next class. I worked out what he was doing. He was using my love of a challenge against me. He knew that if he gave me a hard piece to sing that I would practice every spare moment I could until I had gotten it perfect.<br/><br/>I know it used to drive Dad nuts. It would exasperate him to no end when I came home cuts and bruises all over my arms and legs, bits of twigs and stray leaves clinging to my hair and clothes. All because one of the boys had said that I couldn't beat him to the top of the tallest tree in the woods. Or that I was too scared to climb to the top of a cliff and jump into the water.<br/><br/>Mum would go mental on those days. She'd shake her head and wonder how she had given birth to a tomboy with the voice of an angel. Mum was glad when adolescence slowed me down a little, and my interests changed. I began taking more of an interest in how I looked and listening to her about how I should be acting as a young lady. <br/><br/>Even the boys I grew up with changed in how they treated me. I had always been one of the boys, able to out ride, out climb and out swim almost all of them. As I grew more towards adulthood, I began to see them treating me more as a girl. It was funny to watch them as they all tried to win me as their girlfriend. <br/><br/>True to my nature. I wanted none of them. I wanted the one boy I had never been able to beat at anything. He was always a second or two faster than me, a meter or so in front and a lot stronger than me in everything. He had always been there right beside me whenever I thought I had won and he was the one challenge in my life up to that point that I could never conquer.<br/><br/>He was the reason I took more interest in my appearance, he was the reason that I slowed down my tomboy ways. He was the one person I could never have and because of that I wanted him all the more. <br/><br/>Perhaps that is why Illisidel intrigues me so much. I sense that same unavailability in him. Although there is something deeper than a mere distance to him. He knew how to laugh once. He once enjoyed life to the full. I can see it written in the lines of his face. But something happened and now eyes that once sparkled with mischief now only speak of sadness.<br/><br/>In all my years of searching, I have never come across someone who I had been able to connect with on a musical level. Not even Riavis, a man whose talent with a guitar is almost unequalled, has that same sort of connection with me. <br/><br/>I may be imagining the connection with Illis. Light knows I've made that mistake before. I thought I had found the one that I could make beautiful music with, the one that could help bring my songs to life. But I was wrong. He only wanted me for my voice and the warmth I could bring to his bed when no other woman was foolish enough to join him. <br/><br/>Thank the Light that one of my childhood playmates had found me and made me see what was happening. If he hadn't, I shudder to think of what my life would have turned out to be like. That day, I was glad that my parents had insisted I learn something other than singing. I took up my bow and worked my way through Azeroth and the Outland, looking for something, but not really finding it. Then again, how am I supposed to find something when I don't even know what I am looking for?<br/><br/>It is almost time for me to meet Illis. Last night, I stayed and talked with him after Mina and Rivi had gone their separate ways. Something inside me whispered that he might be the one that I was searching for, the one that could bring my music to life. I asked him to help me with a song. One that I had written when life was dark and I was struggling to find my way.<br/><br/>Not only did he agree to help, but he knew the right melody to go with my words! We're going to meet and work on it a little more. I'm planning to surprise Mina and Rivi with it when we have our first performance in the circus. Who would have thought a chance meeting would have led in the direction it has. The Light works in mysterious ways. If just one thing had been different the night Mina, Rivi, Illis and myself met, it wouldn't have been the same.<br/><br/>I count myself lucky that I met such talented people. Riavis, the talented guitarist, Illisidel, the quiet serious man that can play four instruments that I know of, but claims to be best at the piano, and Minaethiel, a mage that has the ability to firedance in such a graceful manner that you cannot help but stop and watch.<br/><br/>I wonder what Mina, Rivi and even Illis would say if they knew that underneath the flirting, the teasing, the playfulness, lay a much more serious side. A side that longs for love, but despairs of ever truly finding it.

It was a dark and foreboding place the Master had taken up residence. Just another temporary home, while he moved his fingers and put into action certain plans and mechanisms only he could ever connect to each other and continue to control.<br/><br/>Wraithful stood patiently waiting for Him to remember he was here. He would never make the sorry mistake the goblin rogue had made. Well, the last mistake he ever made. The Death Knight served The One because they held a similar past, and He gave him work that satisfied his needs and desires to kill and torture.<br/><br/>The voice was deep rich and resonated with a power all of its own as The One spoke to him, "She is to be wed to the paladin who saved her. How quaint, how touching. Send her a dozen black roses saying merely, 'Congratulations', Wraithful."<br/><br/>"Yes, Master." His voice was calm and a monotone.<br/><br/>"I am trying to decide, my minion, whether to send you to the slip of a priestess in Northrend, or perhaps to that lovely little witch in Silvermoon. Let me think on it a little more, before I decide."<br/><br/>"Paladins....why do they have so many blasted paladins in this so called circus? Bah, it matters not, I will slowly tinker and toy with it a little more, until it is to more of my likes and taste."<br/><br/>"Master, why? Why do you take an interest in this Cirque?", Wraithful had not been given the right to speak, and he realized it even as the words slipped from his dead lips.<br/><br/>"Why? <strong>WHY?</strong>" The last 'why' being shouted enough to make the very walls of the new base shake and rumble. "Because she vexes me. Now go and do what I have told you. And Wraithful..."<br/><br/>"Yes, Master?"<br/><br/>"Never speak out of turn again. For I have other lieutenants eager to be my right hand. Is this understood?"<br/><br/>"Yes, My Lord and Master, I understand."

Illisidel Lightsun paced in his room at his home in Silvermoon, though he had earned quite a bit of coin for his ervices in Northrend he still preferred to live modestly giving the majority of his earnings to the poor, or the orphanages. Still he needed a fairly big house to store all of his instruments, each room in his house, save the kitchen, and the bedroom were all devoted to a different type of music. String, air, etc, he even had room specifically designed for when he was struck to sing, but by far his favorite room in the house, was the one that housed his grand piano, that particular instrument got a room all to itself. <br/><br/>Normally he would be sitting at that piano, and playing letting himself get lost in the music, but tonight was different, he was not in the mood, he was sad, and angry all at once. He stopped in front of his mirror, and stared at his haggard refelction, the sight of his worn look angering him further, until he punched through the mirror to be rid of the offending image. His hand bled, it would not interfere with his playing, he had practiced until his hands bled before, and still kept going. He looked down at his bleeding glass filled hand, and smiled sadly, the pain making him feel a little better, for that is what he deserved...pain.<br/><br/>An hour or two later he sat at his desk, after cleaning his hand, and bandaging it, he was an expert in the art of healing, having brought people back from the brink of death in Northrend. So this little, "scratch," was easy enough for him to take care of, but he would not use the Light to heal such a minor wound, he picked up his pen, and began to write.<br/><br/><em> Tonight was a disaster, I knew I should not have returned to Thunderbluff in the mood I am in, but I promised Kass I would help her with her song. I plan to keep that promise, just not at that time, no I could not play for her tonight, nor did I want to play at all, only after the others pressured me did I grudgingly pull out my guitar. As I figured it was not my normal play, I prefer slow, and melodious, songs that invoke tears, and emotions, when I play on my own. I do not begrudge the others for their preferences, the fast paced, exciting music is good sometimes too, but what I played was neither of those things. <br/><br/>The song I played contained nothing, but anger, as I furiously played, needless to say it did not improve my mood. Perhaps my mood came from not being able to sleep last night, my dreams filled with nothing, but the painful memories of Northrend. Tonight again it does not appear sleep will claim me, all I see when I close my eyes is the looks the others gave, one of them anger, one of them indifference, and the last concern. Those eyes, those looks pain me, and yet I cannot explain, what is wrong, no my sins I must bear alone, trusting in the Light that one day I will be able to forgive myself. Though I feel it is not a good idea, I will return to Thunderbluff again to help Kass with her song, I pray there will be no questions about my bandaged hand, of course I could always say it was from practicing too much, but I have a feeling any of them would see through the lie.<br/><br/>Which brings me to another point, I get the feeling Rivi is hiding something from us all, whenever we are together, though I act friendly something in me tells me to smite the man. I get nothing, but dark feelings when he is around, feelings I have not felt since Outland, I have no proof, so I will stay silent for now, but I believe I am beginning to understand who, and what Riavis is.</em>

The woman slowly awoke as awareness came to her conscious mind. She was no longer a captive of the vile orcish Death Knight, the warm satin sheets and the silken nightgown told her that much. And her hands came up to gently rub her eyes, and she stretched languidly letting her body kinks and aches ease away in that lazy stretch.<br/><br/>Briefly she thought of going back to sleep, snuggling back under the blankets and cuddling the pillow. When it came to her mind that she was engaged. Engaged...engaged!! She pulled her left hand out and looked at the beautiful ring that Leon had presented to her. Oh, how it sparkled, oh, how it shined in the morning sunlight, and a pleasant smile came across her delicate lips as she gazed upon the promise of Leon's love for her.<br/><br/>Her breath caught in her throat as she thought of the ruggedly handsome paladin. He's mine. He loves me, and oh how I love him so. Her skin got goosebumps as she thought of her new fiance, and the care he had given her once they got back to Silvermoon. Oh, my sweet precious Leon! <br/><br/>She hugged herself, as she slid from between the sheets, and gazed into the full length mirror in the corner of the room. She was to be wed, married to her dream man....married to Leon...and for some reason that made her shiver, and her mind began to think of moments...intimate moments with the man she loved...and she started to giggle, then she began to laugh. She never thought it possible, how one could marry the man of their dreams, and have him rescue them...it seemed so much a thing of fairy tales and stories of fiction.<br/><br/>But she had lived it, and now she was marrying her own Prince Charming. She giggled again, a good giggle, one of mirth and such happiness. She found herself falling back on the bed, her arms around herself, and giggling joyously. <br/><br/>Leon, oh, my lovely handsome Leon, I love you so much!

He soared around the great stone bluffs of Thunder Bluff, the wind and updrafts keeping him aloft amongst the clouds and other small hawks that flew about the area. The wind rushed across his face, his eyes narrow as he dipped and dived the bridges and cables that held the bridges together. <br/><br/>Jakota lit down upon one of the tall wigwams or wikiups of the tauren people. He searched briefly, seeing if she might be home, or nearby. He wanted to thank her for the basket of goods, the tea, and most of all the shirt. A warrior's shirt, one that showed a great deal of time had been spent making it. And it fit him well, she had done an excellent job in the creation of it.<br/><br/>Ginik, how her name echoed through his mind and heart, and he was no longer afraid to talk with her. He wanted to spend some time with her, speak with her again, and perhaps share some of that sweet brewed tea she made. Gini...Gini...he no longer wondered why he couldn't forget her. He remembered the softness of her voice, the deepness of her eyes, and the soft gentle coloring of her skin.<br/><br/>The druid found the skies a wonderous place and found himself desiring to soar beside the lovely Ginik, to see her wings beside his own, and to glide into a warm sunset, perhaps finding a secluded spot for a moment of private...affection. If she found him adequate as a brave, though the care she had made in making the shirt showed him there might be an interest there.<br/><br/>He hoped so. Earthmother, bless your guardian.

Thunderbluff was a busy place. Many had taken refuge here since Orgrimmar had become so hostile. Gini was busy with her leathercrafting. She had never had so many orders, it stressed her she could hardly have time to herself. With a sigh she set the beading basket aside and got up to stretch. She needed to unwind, to soar in the air as a stormraven. <br/><br/>Jana stepped in about that time and greeted the tauren, "Gini, take a break for Light's sake. Go and find that lovesick brave who has been circling the bluffs. I can take over here, most of this stuff is well within my range." she giggled as Gini blushed.<br/><br/>"Jana, you read my mind! How did you know? Yes! I need a break. And some new skins. I am almost out of light hides. If anyone comes looking for goods send them out to gather hides! Perhaps I will find Jakota. I do not know if he even remembers me. He is such a handsome brave. He must have many seeking his attention." she seemed almost heartbroken.<br/><br/>The elf threw a pillow at Gini, "Get going!! He has been circling the bluffs for days looking for you! He likes you, now go and find him!" She sat on the finely woven blanket and began working on some bracers, chuckling to herself.<br/><br/>Gini ducked the pillow in confusion. "He what? No you must be mistaken, he is only kind because I am part of the Cirque. I made him a shirt, he thanked me, yes. He seemed to like it. But maybe he has been to busy to think of me..." she stood in the doorway for a moment. Glancing over at Jana as the elf picked up another pillow. <br/><br/>"All right!! I am going..I might run into him..." Gini giggled and shifted forms. With the grace of the stormcrow she flew high into the air, circling the bluffs, seeking the thermals to send her even higher. Her eyesight was greatly enhanced in this form. Scanning the hills she searched, floating in graceful arcs as she circled.

The sun warmed him as he soared to the mesa, and changed as he lit upon the ground. Perhaps a few pieces of cornbread would do for dinner, with a tall mug of Gini's sweet tea, for he had brewed a large jug at home, and it would accent the taste of the bread.<br/><br/>As he stood to purchase the warm cornbread the tall druid thought about how Gini would accent anyone's day with her warm gentle smile. He couldn't seem to get the lovely woman off of his mind, and in a way, he didn't want to either. He made his purchased and walked towards home. <br/><br/>He wasn't really in a hurry to get there, and he wandered down the paths of the mesa. There was no storyteller tonight, which was a shame. He enjoyed the stories of his ancestors, and those who had made the tribe what it was today by their actions yesterday. <br/><br/>He broke a large piece of the sweetened cornbread off of the main cake, savorying the fullness of the corn on his tongue and the light honeybutter they used. He stopped to look over the rises and the Bluff that he called home. He liked it here, and he hoped to find a place here someday. For now, it was a waystation on the way to his future. A place to rest before moving on to Northrend, and further.<br/><br/>The stormclouds of war were thundering down around them, the tears of many as they escaped Orgrimmar filled the air, and Jakota knew he needed to be there for his people. <br/><br/>He licked the rest of the cornbread from his fingers and wrapped the rest up for the way home, and for that delicious tea. Gini's tea. Strange how his thoughts came back around to her. It warmed his heart to think of her though, and he smiled as he made his way home. The brave that shared his tent with her would be blessed by the Earthmother.<br/><br/>Jakota wanted to be that brave.

Her wit was sharp and quick, that left him thinking and chuckling. So many things about the young mage kept her ever on his mind and in Neryth's heart. He grew more and more fonder of Pfaedra as the time drew closer for their wedding day. <br/><br/>The paladin looked out over the rises and mesas of the Thunder Bluff region. There was a peace here, even as refugees and the lost came here away from the war and craziness that was and is Garrosh Hellscream. <br/><br/>The sindorei sat with his easel out and on his lap, the simple lines and rubbings giving the Mulgore brave almost a life of its own. He found the Tauren fascinating, and had begun sketching the various wikiups and ceremonial places of the capitol. As well as the people who inhabited these bluffs and rises.<br/><br/>He flipped back to the earlier pages, and he sighed at those who were gone now, or had been forgotten. His hand reached out to touch a rendering of the lovely Jahana, and he pulled it back...it was old history. Best left forgotten, but yet remembered in what was learned and taught. He hung his head a moment and murmured a quiet prayer for a lost loved one.<br/><br/>Several pages forward and he beheld the one who would soon be his wife, and these drawings brought a smile to his lips and lifted the dull mood he had begun to foster. Pfaedra was like that, a spirit that lifted his spirit, and so much more. The sparkle of life and humor she carried in those eyes, and the deep love and caring she held for him. He reached out to touch the sketches...they were so close to being her.<br/><br/>However, they were only pictures, images of a woman that never seemed to settle down for very long, a woman so very full of life and living it. And again the thought of her brought a smile to his face, a true smile, one that lit up his eyes as well. He thought of how she wanted to share that life with him, and his heart beat faster. She was and always would be the one who had captured his heart in a very real and loving way.<br/><br/>The Sindorei closed the pad, looking out over the lands of Mulgore, and the bluest sky he had ever seen. This land of Azeroth was spectacular, and he felt an itch within himself to go out and explore it, and place what he saw on a canvas. Perhaps Fae would like to accompany him. He would ask her...soon.

It was late afternoon when Zyss decided to leave the apartment they shared. She had some shopping to do, a few things to pick up, and maybe something special for the two of them for dinner. Her heart was light, the sun was warm, and there was a skip in her step as she wore the new robes she has sown.<br/><br/>Murderer's Row. A dark place, shadows clung to the walls, some due to lack of light, others were those waiting for business transactions to be done. Rats scurried along the walls, and there was the faint smell of urine and death that seemed to cling to the air.<br/><br/>Those whose businesses were not on the up and up, or were considered the undesirables flourished here. There was a Thieves' guild here that catered to the training of them and handing out "jobs" for those with fingers light enough, or blades needed. And a small corner held those of the fel, the witches and warlocks who called demons "friends" or minions. It was here the pretty warlock was headed.<br/><br/>Dark eyes watched as she passed, and as she descended the stairs she felt ghostly hands sweep around her neck and hoist her back in the shadows at the top of those stairs. She struggled to breathe and kicked out as the dark plated warrior grinned up at her. <br/><br/>His voice was deep and gruff, as well as the chuckle that followed, "<strong>I have a message for you to give to the others...</strong>" and his mailed fist held a container that swept up and splashed her with a dark and oily substance. It covered her face, and dripped down on her white robes, smelling of a blood and something else. "<strong>Pass it on, witch.</strong>" As he turned and left her there gasping and in shock.<br/><br/>Then the screaming started as she folded deep within herself and she kept on screaming.

Illisidel Lightsun knelt in the small chapel he had built in his house, praying to the Light for strength, and protection. He knew the light had answered his call, perhaps not in a physical way, but more of a comforting feeling. It was a feeling he never grew tired of, and longed for each day, tonight though was different, he had met with the others, or perhaps what was left of the others, may have been a more accurate description. They all seemed different than before, Mina was so exahausted she could barely stand, Riavis looked like death warmed over, and Kass, well he had not seen the normally confident huntress when he had left.<br/><br/>Everything had one common factor, it all started after they met the head of Cirque this, Vivieka, just who was she that she could cause such a drastic change in those three? He sat at his desk, the Light still surrounding him as he put pen to paper.<br/><br/><em> Things have taken a drastic, and frightening turn, I had never seen the three of them like that, Mina usually so energetic, and full of fire, Riavis normally, so playful, and enjoying life, and Kass normally so confident, and strong. There was none of that tonight Mina looked like she hadn't slept in two days, Riavis looked like his soul was being slowly drained from him, and Kass, I have never seen her so full of... fear, worry, I am not sure what to call it. It all stems from the one night I was absent, when they apparently met the leader of the Cirque, someone named Vivieka.<br/><br/>It didn't surprise me to hear that Riavis had bedded her, but what had she done to him, I had never seen him so... lacking in spirit. I am sure this Vivieka has done something to him, he seemed almost enamored by this woman, when normally he would just brush off his late night activities with a woman with a shrug, and playful smile. No this woman seems to have complete control of him, she has dug her claws into his mind, and is not letting go, even when Kass, and Mina teased him about going to bed with Mina, he made sure to let us know that Vivieka was not around.<br/><br/>I fear he may have bitten off more than he can chew, and that he will bring Mina down into the abyss with him, he may even do the same to Kass if Vivieka told him to. I cannot allow that I have seen men like this before, usually after encountering a succubus, which tells me this Vivieka, like Riavis practices the dark arts. If she is training Riavis, I must end it, there are far too many of their kind fully trained, and dangerous, walking around already. No matter what anyone says, the dark arts will eventually corrupt the user completely, taking away their humanity, and make them unconcerned with the people they hurt, by feeding their demons.<br/><br/>When I told Kass I intended to meet with Vivieka, she practically begged me not to, afraid that she would sink her claws into me like she did Riavis, like she has seemed to do to the entire Cirque. I assured her that I am not easily influenced by women, I have resisted the charms of succubi more times than I can count, I have resisted the many propositions I have received from various women. No, the Light has seen me through everything, it showed me the mistake of Kael'thas, and has seen me through the Third War, the war in Outland, and in Northrend. The Light will see me through this as well, Vivieka will either stop harming my friends, directly or indirectly, or... or what? Will I kill her, to my knowledge she has not caused any harm, save for Riavis, who probably brought it on himself, with his carefree attitude when it comes to relations. What will I do, leave, could I leave my new found friends at her mercy, but could I work for while knowing what she is. For now I will simply prepare my mind for the coming meeting, and cross the bridge of what to do when I come to it.</em>

<em>Wraithful walked confidently past the other minions of the One. He had handled his responsibilities given to him with care and great thought. He wasn't foolish enough to hand it off to flunkies, no, no, no, he did the work himself. There was no glory to be shared, he took on the mantle of doing His bidding alone.<br/><br/>The orc Death Knight stood at attention, awaiting his master's praise. Beneath the great helm he bore a smile that spoke of his place in this organization.</em><br/><br/>"<span class="underline"><strong>YOU FOOL!</strong></span>" The very chamber vibrated with power and anger as He-who-was-without-name showed how annoyed He was. Wraithful fell to his knees, and cowered before his master.<br/><br/>"Wh...what have I done to anger you, Mighty One?" his voice wavered as he tried to build a calmness and some resemblance of dignity. He grew suspicious as there was no immediate response. He knelt in the center of the room, expecting death.<br/><br/>The voice he heard next surprised him, and filled him with fear for it was calm, too calm. "I suppose it is my fault really. Having an orc and not having a blood elf as my right hand. Listen to me, and listen well, Wraithful. I shall stall my seething ire and maybe you will learn from your mistake."<br/><br/>"How much of the vial did I tell you to put on the container, minion?"<br/><br/>"All of it?" He stood standing before the great shadow of the One, and he felt insignificant.<br/><br/>"Try a drop of it. A mere drop. Even now the warlock lies in a coma induced by the vial of mind essences. I cannot say if she will live or die from your error, Wraithful. And I should be able to say with assurance whether she would have or not. You know what that means, Wraithful?" There was an edge to the tone as the question was posed.<br/><br/>"N...no, Master."<br/><br/>"It means I am not in <span class="underline"><strong>CONTROL</strong></span>!!" This time the voice was deafening and the Death Knight found himself falling to his hands and knees. Then he heard a faint whisper, "Because of you."<br/><br/>To give the Death Knight credit, there was not a whimper as his very existence was destroyed to a vapor in a flash of fire and arcane magicks.<br/><br/>"Did you see what happens when you err, or do not follow my instructions to the letter?"<br/><br/>"Yes, Lord.."<br/><br/>"You are my new right hand. Do not disappointment me. Go. I will have need of you later."<br/><br/><em>How was He to rectify what had happened to the young witch? Death was not what He had in mind. He thought carefully then smiled. This might work...and he began reaching out and touching those who could help and still put him back in control of the whole affair.</em>

<em>Her body lay on a bed, relaxed and quiet now. The screaming had faded with the injection of a sedative. The nurses and doctors milled about the frail young woman.<br/><br/>"That blood contained a highly toxic mind controlling narcotic." the doctor in charge murmured. "Spells have been cast, and anything that might or could be an antidote has been administered. It's up to her now. Pity we have no idea who she is." He turned and walked away from the woman in a coma.</em><br/><br/>They circled her, taunting her and reaching out at her, pulling on her robes. The smell of Fel hung so heavy in the air it could be cut with a knife. She stood still in what seemed a simple pillar of light. She had started by watching and staring at those things that flitted just out of her vision, noting blood red eyes that glowed with malice. She saw the tall leathery wings, and the claws that reached out at her, drawing back away from the light.<br/><br/>Zyss held two crystals, one in each hand, as they seemed to radiate a warmth in this cold dismal place. She clung to them, and held them up close to her chest. She closed her eyes, fighting with all her will against the pressure of the fel that surrounded her. The shards seemed to give her strength of will too. Another reason she held them tightly.<br/><br/>Only...how long could she hold out against them.?

The night had been unexpectedly wonderful. Maybe one too many brandies, but still wonderful. She had met another member of the Cirque, a sister so to speak. She had listened to Hani's tale of woe, and she couldn't help ask questions. And maybe she helped, Light she hoped she had helped.<br/><br/>Wyn had offered a ride to Silvermoon, and the young bard had taken her up on it. Wyn said her good-byes and hoped everything would work out for Hani, she seemed so sweet. And Wyn opened the door to the apartment.<br/><br/>It was quiet, almost too quiet, as Wyntar spoke out into the darkness as she brought up the candles to a gentle glow, "Zyss? Are you there, my love? Zyss?" She wandered through the apartment, room by room, and found no sign of the pretty warlock. Wyn set down on the edge of her bed and stifled a yawn. <br/><br/>They really needed to set up some sort of communication between the two of them, the mage thought. Something that let Wyn know when she was with Krei. Though a little jealousy rose within her at the thought of the handsome paladin holding Zyss and kissing her. Wyn snuffed it that out, Zyss had said she loved Wyn too. And the mage held onto that fact.<br/><br/>She lay her head on her soft pillow, and thought of how that paladin better treat Zyss right, or she would have Zyss all to herself. She yawned once more and rolled over to gently fall asleep thinking of the sweet room mate she had.

<em> New Hearthglen</em><br/><br/>The two walking down the street were a strange pair, besides the fact one was a sin'dorei, and the other human, the sin'dorei was a paladin, while the human was a death knight. Fortunately the Edon Blade was welcome in New Hearthglen, so Illisidel Lightsun, had requested help from Dalfein Scourgebane in helping him move. Most of the stuff was put away, so they decided to take a break, Illis telling his friend about his meeting with Vivieka. Dalfein frowned, "The road to hell is paved with good intentions, despite what she says, I don't think you should trust her, many warlocks think themselves immune to being corrupted, but eventually they all fall to it. I fear even your friend Riavis will fall to it eventually, power corrupts it's as simple as that, I hope you will be prepared if you find yourself at odds with them."<br/><br/>Illis nodded, "I am not so foolish my friend, as to trust a warlock, though I think she bought my friendly act, much easier to keep an eye on her, if she thinks I believe her nice girl facade. Unfortunately for her, my senses are a little too spot on for her to trick me," it was true enough throughout their entire conversation, the paladin had had goosebumps, and his hair stood on end. "Whatever she is planning I don't think it will be safe, I believe she thinks she is more powerful than she is, one slip up could spell disaster not only for her, but the entire Cirque."<br/><br/>The death knight nodded, "I suggest you do your best in keeping clear of her plans, don't do anything she tells you, other than to play, that is your job, nothing more, she can't force you to do anything, and worse comes to worse, you can always leave."<br/><br/>The paladin frowned, and nodded, but could he really? Later back in his new home he sat at his desk, and put pen to page.<br/><br/><em> Things will be much more dangerous from now, on Vivieka believes me to have backed down, the time simply wasn't right, I don't trust her. I believe she will try to use me soon, for whatever she has planned, she will be surprised when I out right refuse her. I can't wait to see the look on her face, something tells me she isn't used to people telling her no, when it happens though I should meet with her alone, I don't want the others to get into trouble. Unlike them I am doing this more on a whim, than an actual need of a place to call home, I enjoy playing with the others, but I will not take part in some dark, and sinister scheme, no matter what spin the witch puts on it.<br/><br/>Out of all the nights events, it saddens me that it is that witch that dominates my thoughts, when all I want to think about is Kass. Who would have thought, someone like me would find someone like her, I told her I would stop blaming myself for my comrades deaths in Northrend, and I will, but what I will not do is allow good feelings to cloud my judgement. Light the pain in my heart, if it came down to it, could I leave the Cirque, leave Kass, last night we shared a kiss in the rain, it was the most wonderful feeling in my life. Still I cannot allow personal feelings to cloud my judgement, to cloud my sense of righteousness, I will not allow that witch Vivieka to use me for her own gain. She will find me much harder to fully control than the rest of them, she doesn't lord a paycheck, or a place to stay over me, no she will not control me like she does Rivi, this I swear. I am sorry Kass, Light I am sorry I pray that we can continue on this path we have started, but I must continue down the path I began long before I met you. Still if you could walk down that path with me, I would be the happiest man on Azeroth, if not, well loss, and pain are something I am familiar with, it will be like greeting old friends.</em>

The day had been hot, and Jen was tired with bickering with vendors and wanted only to go home and take a long soaking bath. As she walked down the street towards the door to her abode, she noted a long squarish box with a large black bow. Her brow crinkled as she neared it and picked it up.<br/><br/>The card on the box simply said "Congratulations" as she opened the box with a smile. She dropped it as the dozen black roses spilled out of the box and onto the street. And she backed away. It was bad luck or a bad omen to receive black roses. <br/><br/>She turned and walked into the nearest tavern, and gulped down the mug of ale. Her hands were shaking as she held onto the mug. Who would have sent those to her? Her first thoughts had been they were red roses from her fiance Leon. But black roses? She needed to know. Someone had a sick sense of humor or worse wanted to send her a message.<br/><br/>The paladin ran back outside and up the street towards where she had dropped the box. She avoided the roses, and looked the box over, and found a mark from a florist in Orgrimmar. Orgrimmar? She didn't even know orcs knew about flowers. <br/><br/>This wasn't going to be easy.

Zyss's strength was flagging, and she didn't know how long she could elude their claws and attempted grasps. The light surrounding her was dimming as well, as the narcotic worked its way through her system. Her heart was failing, and her breathing was becoming labored. <br/><br/>The nurse watching over her watched as her skin became pale and a light sheen of sweat covered her brow. She could see the woman was in distress, and also knew the drug was still heavily moving through her too. She stepped away to write her report on the woman's current conditions.<br/><br/>He slid from the shadows quietly and looked down at the warlock. She was going into shock, he had seen it before in others. And he pulled the small vial and syringe from his belt pouch. He wasn't sure this would work, not at this stage of the narcotic's concentration in the woman's body. The needle pricked her arm as he gently pushed the antidote into her arm.<br/><br/>He would not be pleased if she died, but he had done what he had been instructed to do, his master could only wait now.<br/><br/>*******************************************************************<br/>It was a simple note, written in blocked letters, and had been stuck to the door with a very crude dagger. There was a heavy pounding of the door several times before he heard movement and a female voice yell she was coming. He walked away quietly, fading in with the other travellers going in and out of the portal room, or coming to Silvermoon City.<br/><br/>"Yes?", Wyn asked standing inside the door, tying the robe's belt around her. "Hello?"<br/><br/>She really wasn't ready to take on guests at this ungodly hour, what time was it anyway? She glanced at the shaded window and figured it to be late afternoon. She prepared the alarm just to be sure as she slowly opened the door.<br/><br/>There wasn't anyone out here, how freaking strange. She almost missed the dagger stuck in the door as she closed it. She looked around out into the avenue, and saw nothing unusual, so Wyn pulled out the dagger, took the note down, and went back into her apartment. The mage dropped the dagger into a corner as she went towards the kitchen to brew a pot of tea.<br/><br/>She stopped as she read the note, then hurried to her room to dress. "Omigod, Zyss...I'm coming...I'm coming!" The note lay forgotten on chair as the mage dressed hurriedly and rushed out of the apartment towards the hospital.<br/><br/> <strong>If YOU Care EnY ThiNG foUR tHe WarLOCk She LIES DIEiNg In HOSpiTAl</strong>

<em> New Hearthglen</em><br/><br/>Illisidel Lightsun, walked down the streets of New Hearthglen, heading home, there was no one out on the streets except the few Argent Crusade guards that kept the small settlement safe. Finally reaching his home, he closed the door behind him, and leaned on it sighing, "What a night, damn that Vivieka, damn you Rivi." The night had been full of unfortunate events for the paladin, first being told by Vivieka that Rivi might be in trouble because of some stupid book he was sent to retrieve from the Scarlet Monastery. Then in order to help Rivi, he unintentionally helped Vivieka, he knew she would never admit to it, but she had baited he, Kass, and Mina to go and rescue him. She knew full well we couldn't just leave him, and now she had what she wanted, and the paladin cursed, "Damn you Rivi why couldn't you have just taken the help you were told to?"<br/><br/>Later after saying a prayer of forgiveness, the paladin sat at his desk, tapping his pen against his chin, the night hadn't been all bad he supposed, and he smiled wryly as he put pen to paper.<br/><br/><em> It seems Vivieka likes to play games, and trick people into helping her, by using their friends to her advantage. Well you win this time Witch, next time won't be so easy. Of course, the night's events were partly Rivi's fault for not taking help, but since it was Vivieka's order it doesn't surprise me. The Witch has him wound so tight around her little finger, he would do anything to please her, how great would his reward have been if he had brought the book back on his own. I can only imagine it, and the images make me sick, thank the Light I am not so easily seduced by women.<br/><br/>Or am I, lately my thoughts, have been filled with nothing, but the smiling face of Kass, even when I try to piece together whatever Vivieka has planned, her face pops into my mind. Am I losing it, my mind, have I gone insane, I suppose one could call it that, but not insane in the normal meaning. I...I think I may be falling for her, of all people me, falling for a woman so hard, that her every tease makes me blush, her very prescence, and slight touch makes me smile. Could it be, or am I in a similar situation as Rivi, being played, being used, and seduced, so that I would do anything for her.<br/><br/>No, I cannot believe that, Kass may be a tease, but I do not, cannot believe that she is anything like Vivieka. Still until I know how she truly feels about me I know that worry will be nagging me in the back of my mind. Still is it too early for me to ask that question, to ask her what she thinks, and feels about me, to ask her if I am just some fling, or am I something more to her. Light these thoughts pull at my heart, but can I work up the courage to ask her these questions, if she does feel about me the way I think I feel about her, I do not want these terrible thoughts to remain, to keep me on guard. I want to be fully open to her if she does feel the same as I, and if not I need to quetion whether or not it is worth to continue playing her game.<br/><br/>I blame Vivieka for these thoughts, seeing what she has made Rivi do, in exchange for her company in bed. It is hard for someone like me, someone who has little experience with personal relationships with women, to not wonder if deep down all women are like that Witch. I need to know, need to find out before these thoughts consume me, and possibly ruin any possibility of me finding love... yes, love I believe that is the feeling I have for Kass, I need to know, how she feels. I will broach the subject when next we are alone, oh, Light give me the courage to find out the answer, and give me the strength to carry on if her feelings do not match my own.</em>

Illisidel Lightsun smiled the whole way back to New Hearthglen, right now, he didn't think anything could remove that smile. She loved him, Kass loved him, it had been what the paladin needed to hear, if he ever had a hope of getting back to the way he used to be. He had been nervous when he first started his confession, but there had been no need, he had only gotten halfway through it, when she had told him she felt the same. His heart had soared, and he felt as though he would just float away, of course Kass wouldn't let him, no neither one of them would go anywhere without the other anymore. For he knew without a doubt that without her in it, there was no way his life could ever be happy. They had shared many kisses some, on the hands, and cheeks, and a few real kisses, the feeling of her lips on his still fogged his mind.<br/><br/>When he returned home he immediately went to his piano, and began playing a song, his mother had taught him long ago, she had told him, it symbolized her, and his father's love for each other, and that he should play when he found someone he loved more than anything.<br/><br/>((http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZXRVcW21Jc you will have to use your imaginations for the piano))<br/><br/>After he was finished, he sat at his desk, and put pen to paper, his smile still remaining.<br/><br/><em> The world is wonderful, despite the war going on, you can still find love, and happiness, if you just look for it. I have found that love, someone who completes my heart, and can mend it, someone who I know I can no longer live without. Tonight I discovered that Kass loves me, and that my fears were foolish, and caused by my head thinking that no one would ever want to be with me. No, I should have listened to my heart in the first place, should have known without a doubt that Kass, was not like that Witch, Vivieka.<br/><br/>I feel horrible for ever comparing the two, but Kass didn't care, it didn't change the way she felt, I don't know how long we sat there holding hands, and exchanging furtive glances, and hesitant kisses, well hesitant for me anyway. I wonder if I should not let Kass take the lead, for I have no clue what I am doing, but at the same time, I fear if I do, my morality may be in danger. I still can't help but wonder if she would enjoy tying me up, and I fear I would probably let her, heh. It's amazing how much finding love can change your outlook on life, before I saw the world through my despair, at blaming myself for my comrades deaths in Northrend. Now I see that they would not want me to live that way, they would want me to be happy, to find love, and to live how I used to, not living a life of full debauchery like Rivi, but the moderate fun I used to have.<br/><br/>I have Kass to thank for everything, for my new outlook, for showing me her love, everything, I love you Kass, more than anything, and I thank the Light that I was able to find you.</em>
