So deep was she in her reverie, she didn’t hear anything in the room nor see anything in the reflection of the mirror. And when he touched her hand, there was a gasp, and she began to fall into a defensive crouch. And even as she heard the voice she had longed to hear, and saw the face of the one she desired, her arm went back as her delicate hand formed into a tight fist. <br/><br/>Then recognition lit up in her emerald green eyes, and she sprang from the crouch to encircle Leon’s neck with her arms, her soft lips kissing his face, and cheeks, until they locked with his in a warm and loving kiss that seemed to linger on. <br/><br/>Her arms held him close, and she was slow to break the kiss she had wanted for so very long. Her soft body clung to his strong masculine form, as Jen looked into the wonderfully loving eyes of her fiancé. Her voice barely came out a whisper, as she spoke, “Tell me you are mine for more than a day. Tell me we have time to do all those delicious things I plan to do to you. Tell me you love me, Leon.” <br/><br/>Her eyes drew tears as her dreams and wishes had come true and he was really here in her arms. Her heart beat fast, and she held his face close to hers once more, the kiss passionate and full of desire for the man she had been waiting was here, and he would know she had missed him so very much.

It was too much, he brought his lips to meet hers in a kiss that was like sweet water to a thirsty man. <br/><br/>Slowly the kiss ended. Jen's beautiful body clung to his, shaping itself to rest on his as much as it could. His arm went around her waist and held her close. It had been so long since he had held her. Yet it was as if they had never been apart. She belonged in his arms, and He would make sure she stayed there. The reports said that she was ready to join him in the field permanently and he knew he could not walk away from her again. This time, he was going to take her with him.<br/><br/>His free hand reached up and began to stroke her hair. <em><strong>“Tell me you are mine for more than a day. Tell me we have time to do all those delicious things I plan to do to you. Tell me you love me, Leon.” </strong></em><br/><br/>Leon moved his hand under her chin and tilted her head so he could look into her eyes. He brushed away the forming tears. "My goddess, my angel. I love you so much. You have me for more than just a few hours, more than just one night. You have me here at your side for three days."<br/><br/>Jen raised her hands to his face and pulled him down to her for a kiss that spoke of passion and desire, and promised that the next three days would hold all the delights known only to lovers.

She lay her head on his shoulder, her hand gently caressing his face. Leon was here, here, physically here. She raised her face to nuzzle against Leon's neck, and kissed his jawline, happy in the knowledge he was hers for the next several days.<br/><br/>Jen smelled him, taking in his strong scent, the simple action and reaction causing a small tickle within her being. She had fallen into his arms, enjoying the feel of his muscles around her, and having that sense of protection and security from the man of her dreams. Her soft feminine body clung to his battle hardened one, and she would have it no other way. And she gazed up into his face as he looked down into hers.<br/><br/>Her head fell back wanting only his lips on hers, for him to see that she was opened to him to take her and do as he willed. Her voice was husky and low, giving it a very sensuous sound, as she murmured to him, "Take me, Leon, take me and do as you wish with me...please." <br/><br/>She lifted her head to see his response, and the sight of the burning desires and passion contained within his eyes sent a delicious shiver down her spine and throughout her whole being. And Jen anticipated a night that the both of them would not soon forget, nor want to forget. Her lips formed the words without a sound, "I want you."

The priest went from tavern to tavern, inn to inn throughout the vast city of Dalaran, and what he heard caused his heart to ache within his chest. At first she had been a joy to listen to and patrons had called for her to return and listen to the spirited music she brought with her. Yet, slowly she had become weaker, listless, and she seemed almost sick. The concern and worry he had felt was compounded as he heard the replies to his inquiries.<br/><br/>It was while he was talking to one barkeep that a troll sitting nearby told him that he had taken her to the clinic, and that she had been in a real bad way, a bad mojo was how he explained it. Azmos flew to the clinic on Appollon’s wings. He scanned the beds as a nurse came to ask him who it was he sought. As he described her, and told her of his fears, she reached out and grabbed his arm. “Sir, she was critical, we could not help her. We did what we could, but our resources are limited.”<br/><br/>Az stumbled out of the clinic, where would she be in such dire consequences? He bent his head and prayed, and he could feel the Light within him pulse and grow. There would be only one place for her to go – Silvermoon. So he gathered up his gear, and Cosmo, using the portal to the Orcish city of Ogrimmar, and then hopping on a freighter to Silvermoon. The whole time his mind whirled and spun out of control, then the warmth of the Light prevailed upon him, and he found solace in the golden power of the Light. <br/><br/>The strider could not move him fast enough to the infirmary in Silvermoon. He jumped off its back, and ran inside, seeking out Hahnai. A nurse took him to the room, and he walked in slowly. His gaze fell on the tubes that went into her body. Azmos grew so quiet, as he watched her take feeble breaths, and how pale and thin she looked. And the tears came unbidden as he saw Hahnai in such a state, as a hand came to his mouth, and he tried to compose himself. He moved beside the bed and fell to his knees, as the priest tried to find his voice to let her know he was there. <br/><br/>Hahnai, slowly turned her head, and opened her eyes. “Are you a dream? Are you here to torment me, knowing I want you here beside me?” <br/><br/>“No, beloved, it is I, your Azmos, I am here.” He was barely able to choke out the words he was so overcome at seeing her like this.<br/><br/>Tear welled in her eyes, as she reached out to him, “You came. My heart cried out to you… and…you came.” His own hand reached out to her, and leaned in closer to kiss her small thin fingers, and he saw his own hand cover her completely. She struggled to talk, whispering “I love you, Az…I missed you so much.”<br/><br/>He swallowed hard, as he clasped her hand in his, and looked into her red rimmed eyes. “I love you, my darling. I am here, and at your side I will remain.” He whispered gently, “Don’t talk, beloved you’re so weak, save your strength.”<br/><br/>It was not enough to see him, to touch him, or to talk to him, and she slowly pulled herself up to lean on him, “Hold me…let me feel your arms around me again.” And the tall priest pulled her close, and held her to his chest, his lips kissing her head, and tears falling down his face.<br/><br/>She could hear his heartbeat as she laid her head on his chest; however she felt the Light as it left him to flow into her own body. She drew a breath, and there wasn’t the struggle to do so, and her arms encircle him, as it continued to flow between them. “Az? Do you feel that? I can feel the Light flowing into me from you.” And Azmos could see that her eyes were brighter, and a shade of pink was coming to the pallor of her skin. He held her in his arms, feeling her growing warmer in his embrace.<br/><br/>The head nurse was making her rounds, and looked in on the frail little priestess that had come in earlier that day. She saw then holding each other in a warm embrace, and she stopped. Something she couldn’t explain was happening and she stepped back, letting them alone, as she quietly closed the door behind her. And Hahnai pulled up closer to her Azmos kissing him tenderly.<br/><br/>The pretty bard whispered her love for him, and he spoke softly of never leaving her side. And so overwhelmed by the love he felt for Hahnai, Azmos asked for her hand in marriage, to which she excitedly said yes. They held each other through the night, their love healing them both, and bringing them together as the Light had intended.

Wyntar lay sleeping on the bed; her spouse lay beside her, her hand over the mage’s extended pregnant belly. Zyss would talk to Wyn’s belly tell their baby how welcome they were to the world, and how its parents would love and nourish them. Tonight she was gently singing to the baby when the baby kicked, and the pretty warlock felt it on her hand. Her lovely emerald green eyes opened wide in surprise and delight, and she turned to look at her love and her lifelong mate. <br/><br/>The comely mage looked sweet even as she slept, her long white curls framed the face the warlock had come to know and love. Her full soft lips were parted as she snored lightly, which made Zyss smile, even though Wyn would deny she snored at all. And the sprinkle of a few light freckles gave the mage a pixie like look, and Zyss wished she were as lovely as she.<br/><br/>The warlock moved her hand slowly over the “bump” as Wyn called it. She liked the feel of Wyn’s skin, the softness and warmth gave Zyss a sense of comfort and love. And as she caressed the mage’s belly, she could feel the little life beneath the skin move once more, and it tickled her to no end. Her long red hair fell over her face, and covered Wyn’s belly, as Zyss kissed the mage’s belly where the baby was moving.<br/><br/>She wanted this baby so much. Zyss wasn’t as sure that Wyn was, but that might be the discomfort, and weight gain talking too. However, the warlock looked forward to all the little changes that would occur when their daughter or son came into the world. She would read to him, and happily change her without any problems. Feeding her, and then all the time it would take to clean him up, just to do it all over again. <br/><br/>Zyss leaned down and kissed Wyn tenderly, and was surprised when Wyn reciprocated. The mage raised her arms to pull Zyss down to her, as the kiss deepened, and the mage really kissed Zyss. Zyss returned the kiss with equal fervor, and groaned against the mage’s mouth. The kiss lingered a moment, and it was the warlock who pulled back gasping for breath. Wyn smiled up at her, and pulled her back for another passionate kiss.<br/><br/>A quarter of an hour later, Zyss paused to catch her breath, “Whatever brought that on, my love? Not that I am complaining mind you, I wished you woke up like that more often.” And she laughed lightly as she gazed into the pale green eyes of the mage.<br/><br/>Wyn’s eyes danced with mischief, and had a definite sparkle to them, as she looked up into face of her lover, closest friend, and now her mate. Her hand reached up to touch the cheek of the most desirable woman she had ever known. The red hair cascaded down the warlock’s shoulders, and accented the delicate features of her face, and really brought out the green of her lover’s eyes. The fingers slipped back to gently fondle the blood elf’s long ears, knowing full well how much it drove the warlock crazy. Zyss moaned, and closed her eyes enjoying Wyntar’s touch. <br/><br/>It was while her eyes were closed that the mage pulled the warlock’s naked body over her own, and kissed her wantonly. Tonight she wanted that pretty little warlock, and nothing was going to stop her, not even being pregnant. And Zyss accepted the love and passion her mate was willing to give her, for she too would have the mage, and make her cry out before the night was over.

Jen’tira lay next to her husband to be, her arms wrapped around him possessively, not wanting him to, not wanting to be apart from him again. Her leg was thrown over his two and she kissed the firm muscles across his chest. She laid her head on his chest then, listening to his heartbeat and gentle breathing as he slept. Tears came and flowed down her cheeks at the thought she would not see him again for weeks at a time.<br/><br/>Jen brought a hand up to touch his cheek, and then slowly lowered to touch his jawline. The female paladin looked up at Leon’s profile from his shoulder, falling in love him all over again as she thought how ruggedly handsome he was. How his lips felt on hers and brought out the woman in her. He was everything she wanted and needed in a man. <br/><br/>He was a paladin also, and they shared a mutual interest and use of the Light. He was strong, and a great fighter. She wanted to fight alongside him, defeating injustice, evil, and the Alliance. She would protect him, and heal him, as his mighty arm swung the sword, and lead the charge! Oh, how seeing him like that inspired her, and turned her on like nothing else could. <br/><br/>After combat, she wanted nothing more than to tear that armor off of him, and kiss Leon, and let him take her to a place only he could lead her. Oh, how she loved to smell his manly scent, and have his hands upon her. Jen found she turned to putty around him, and on him. And when he had asked for her hand in marriage, it had been a resounding ‘YES!’ <br/><br/>And now these last few hours of his leave would take him away from her again. Alone, and wanting to be near him, an endless ache in her heart. If not for the necklace, if not for the heart shaped locket, she would become lost. Jen looked at it several times a day, waiting for the time they would be back together again, holding each other close.<br/><br/>Once she said “I do” she would never leave his side again, she would become his shadow, his angel on the battlegrounds, and always remain his lover.

At first his anger was high; he had been taken to who knows where, for his protection from some dark master. Why him, he wasn’t sure, but if what they said was true, his future wife was left alone without his protection. He told them flat out he wasn’t interested in protection, he had the Light and that had always been enough in the past. He wanted to be returned to his Phaedra, and he wanted it now!<br/><br/>Neryth badgered and ranted, finally he was placed before the group of people who had more or less kidnapped him for his own good, or so they said. Yes, he had seen the Death Knights arrival, and no, he probably would have died. Yet they had not taken his fiancée, and if something should happen to her while he was being detained and held prisoner against his will, heads would roll, it would be made public and he would complain before the Counsel in Silvermoon City.<br/><br/>With a caution to be alert of his surroundings, and aware of what was going on around him, they released Neryth, and ported him to Silvermoon City. Released, like a common criminal, while he was an honored Blood Knight? He questioned whoever they were the right to take him. The first thing the paladin did was seek out his lady love, the one who meant the world to him, his Phaedra.<br/><br/>The Blood Knight rode hard towards the cozy home they had made for themselves, eager to hold her once more, and to see her face, light he had missed her. He could only imagine how worried she would have been and be right now, and he pushed the charger ever faster to Fae. Eventually he saw their home up ahead, and his heart quickened, and he sprung from the saddle, to burst through front door – <br/><br/>“Phaedra! Phaedra, my love, are you here? I’m here; your Neryth is here, my love!”

The sorceress stood before the portal she had created, hesitant, unsure if she should in her condition, however she stepped through to find herself only a hundred yards from where she wanted to be, the Silvermoon Hospital.<br/><br/>Wyntar bent over as the intense pain stuck her again, intense pain from her womb, and she kept praying that everything would be alright. <br/><br/>The blood elf woman walked a little closer, only 50 yards to go, when she felt her water break. Her legs felt weak, as she stood and looked down at the pool of water and…and blood. <br/><br/>She managed to walk a few more feet, before she stumbled and fell to the ground. The mage crawled towards the hospital, one thought on her mind, ‘my baby’.<br/><br/>And trail of blood followed her. Someone screamed, but it wasn’t her. There were faces all around her, hands pulling at her, and she felt like it was some sort of dream…no, more like a nightmare.<br/><br/> <em>“Mama…mama…”</em><br/><br/>The light was bright, so bright, she heard voices murmuring, doctors with their masks on fading into and out of her vision, nurses holding her hands. <br/><br/><em>“Mama…mama…ma…” </em><br/><br/>She opened her eyes as she heard his voice as clear as day, pleading to her, his cries growing fainter, and fainter.<br/><br/><strong>“We need you to push. Push, woman, push.” </strong><br/><br/>Wyn tried, but felt her strength fading fast, why did she feel so lightheaded?<br/><br/>She felt lighter than air, as she saw herself on the table, she felt detached and yet a part of what was happening.<br/><br/>“We’re losing her, doctor!”<br/><br/>Wyn looked down and could see his head and shoulders as he was born.<br/> <br/>There was no pain, only joy as she saw her son born. He was so beautiful.<br/><br/>He cried without being spanked, as she faded away.<br/><br/><strong><em>‘MAMA!”</em></strong>

It had taken her hours to finally get this far. Why was there so much paperwork? Why were they doing this to her? She had just lost her love, her spouse, and her heart was breaking…why now? <br/><br/>The pretty warlock sat at a chair, her shoulders slumped forward, and her head bowed, Zyss’ mind and heart trying to cope with the news that Wyntar was gone. She had just told her how much she loved her this morning. She couldn’t be…it was a mistake, it was someone else…some…one…else…please, someone else.<br/><br/>But it wasn’t someone else, as they pulled back the cloth that covered the dead mage, and Zyss looked down at her lover, friend, and spouse. The tears welled up in her eyes again, and the vision of Wyntar laying there blurred, and she nodded her head slowly, whispering softly, “Yes, that’s her.” <br/><br/>How she wanted to grab her, and hold her tight in her arms one more time, to feel Wyntar’s arms around her. However, that wasn’t going to happen…ever. And the warlock’s lip trembled as she left the room.<br/>*********************************************************************************************************<br/>A nurse brought him to her, all wrapped in a soft blue baby blanket. The nurse set the little baby in Zyss arms, and watched as the woman folded back the flap that covered his face. Zyss’ eyes filled with tears as she gazed down at the little son that Wyn had brought into the world. He was the spitting image of Wyntar; she saw her eyes, her face, her cheekbones, everything reminded her of Wyn. He was her son there was no denying it.<br/><br/>His little mouth yawned as he slept, and she fell in love with their son immediately, and she smiled. She remembered that Wyn always said it would be a girl, because she tormented and vexed her so in the womb. Still, Zyss knew deep down in her heart it was a boy. And what a beautiful baby boy he was. <br/><br/>She undid the blanket he was wrapped in, counting his fingers and toes, several times just be sure. She brushed a finger over his cheek and watched as he turned with it. His tiny elven ears were adorable, and she kissed his forehead before wrapping him back up. Zyss whispered,” Your momma would be so in love with you right now. Just as I am this very minute,” she said as she held him close to her, and gently rocked and patted him.<br/>*******************************************************************************************************<br/>She looked at the sheet before her; it was all filled out except for the baby’s name. Name, what name would fit him, or suit him? And as she thought, one popped into her head and she wrote it down on the sheet. It was a mage’s name, and it sounded right to her, he would follow in the footsteps of his mother, he would be a mage. Yes, his name would be…<br/><br/><strong><em>Aristobylus</em></strong>

The house was empty, and yet it seemed that someone still lived there. Fresh cookies were in the cookie jar. The pantry held a fresh loaf of bread, uncut and wrapped in a paper to keep it fresh. The cooler that Pfaedra had installed in the kitchen held plenty of easily fixed items like salad fixings and lunch meat. A jug of fresh milk sat there as well.<br/><br/>On the table a note sat propped up against the napkin holder and held there by the salt shaker. But no Pfaedra in any of the rooms. The bed was made and the house was clean. Where could she be? The note was rather cryptic.<br/><br/>---------------<br/><br/>My dearest love Neryth, <br/><br/>I have been called to Northrend. I am sure you will get orders soon as well. I am sorry I missed you if you come home to look for me. I was told you are well, but no one would tell me where you were. My heart aches for you. But I cannot go against the orders of the Council. I was not given any choice. We do not seem to be having a lot of luck lately. I hope I see you again soon. Know that I will always have you in my heart. Light be with you!<br/><br/>Love,<br/>Pfaedra<br/><br/>------------------------------<br/><br/>How long ago she had left was pretty obvious, no more than a day at most. Perhaps if he spoke to the Commanders he would find where she had been sent. Dalaran was not safe, that left the Howling Fjord or Borean Tundra. Two ends of a huge continent to search. Where to start?

The communication stone came alive with the goblin’s excited voice, “Boss, he’s here! He’s here! I gotta visual even as I’m speakin’ at’cha.” A black plated glove held the goblin technological marvel in its depths, as a deep sonorous voice spoke slowly and deliberately.<br/><br/>“Contain yourself, thief. Is he alone, or are there others with him? Be sure to look carefully, they may be cloaked.” He waited as he stared at the device. If what the goblin said was true, the paladin had made a grave mistake, one he looked forward to capitalizing on. The Master had been very clear that this one was to be sought out and made an example. No one was out of his reach, no one.<br/><br/>The device came back to life after a few moments of silence. “He’s alone, boss. Ain’t no one wit ‘im. Not that I can sees anyways, and I got me super-duper goggles on to be sure. What ya want me to do, boss?” There can be heard the sound of heavy breathing, and branches being pulled back over the tiny speaker of the stone.<br/><br/>The knight waited while he thought about it, then his voice came over the speaker, quiet and calm, “Do nothing, thief, for now. When he leaves, and he will leave, go in and search the place. Then I want you to burn it down.”<br/><br/>“B-B-Burn it down, boss?”<br/><br/>“Was there something not clear in my orders, goblin?” There was a definite edge and tension in the voice as it came over the device.<br/><br/>“N-N-No, sir, just verificating is all.”<br/><br/>“Good.” The black gauntlet touched a small button to the side of the communication stone, and the deep voice spoke again, “One and Two, you heard?”<br/><br/>Two voices in quick unison spoke from the stone, “Yes, Lord Lucifearyx!”<br/><br/>“Stand by for your orders.”<br/><br/>Again in perfect unison, the two voices rang out, “Yes, Lord Lucifearyx!” The dark knight grinned in his black helm, as he shook his head.<br/><br/>“Goblin?”<br/><br/>“Yes, Lord Lucifearyx!” This time the dark lord chuckled into the device.<br/><br/>“When the paladin exits the house, let One and Two know immediately, and goblin, I do mean immediately. Understood?”<br/><br/>“Yes, sir, I-I-I mean, yes, Lord Lucifearyx!” The thief looked down at the device as it trembled and a loud hollow sounding laughter came over the commstone. He had never heard such a sound before, and he hoped he never would again.<br/><br/>The gauntlet pressed two buttons together for privacy, as the Lord spoke once more, “One and Two, here is what I want you to do. First,….”

The warlock looked at the sheet of paper in her hand, tears filling her eyes, her mind screaming in unbelief. <br/><br/> ***********<br/>Wyntar had told Zyss she felt an obligation to tell the father of the baby she carried that there was baby. Zyss had been resistant at first, a man to interfere in the affairs of their lives and love. Wyn had cajoled the pretty warlock, and after several weeks of discussion and, yes some fighting, the mage had won out. <br/><br/>Wyn wrote the letter, almost sure it would never find him, and yet there was a part of her heart that prayed the paladin would know; that Jorym would accept the legacy of the love they had shared. Her mind and thoughts went back to the time and love they had shared, of Dalaran, and the passions they ignited within one another. The letter took her several days and pages to write, finally signing it simply “<em>Love, Wyn</em>”.<br/><br/>************<br/>The mage had mailed it herself (not that she didn’t trust Zyss, she did) and it was just that she wanted to be the one who did it, no other rational reasoning other than that. It took several months before it ever reached the man named Jorym now located in Stormwind City. His eyebrow went up at the Silvermoon City postmark, and he noticed several military postmarks on it as well, yet the envelope was intact, and the seal never broken.<br/><br/>He went and sat on a bench located outside the Cathedral of Light, and carefully opened the envelope. A smile came to his lips as he recognized the faint sent of Wyntar’s perfume on the pages as he pulled them from the envelope. His blue eyes moved over the mage’s delicate writing, taking in her thoughts and memories, and then stopping as he read the final page.<br/><br/><em>My darling, I am with child, your child. I thought I had taken all the proper precautions to prevent this from happening, but somehow it has happened, and I carry your baby. I was hesitant to tell you, and my dear sweet Zyss advised me against it, yet I felt you should know, thus the true reason for this letter. Not that I didn’t love you, my paladin, I did, I left you for Zyss had written a letter, a very deep and caring letter, and I left in a hurry. </em><br/><br/><em>It still does not lessen my feelings for you, but I love Zyss, and we are to be wed in a few hours. She will be the perfect one to nurture and love our baby. She fusses over me so as it is, and I love it.</em><br/><br/><em>I would have you meet your son or daughter soon after their birth. We will come to Dalaran, and the three of us shall make a week of it, so that you may see what our love has created.</em><br/><br/><em>I hope you are not cross. I did not do this for anything; it came to me as much of a surprise as it is to you now. If you do not wish to see us, I will try to understand, and I shall raise our child up as I think best. But with all my heart, I pray you would at least want to see our baby…please?</em><br/><br/><em>I should close this, and yet I would dearly love to see those deep blue eyes of yours again, and to have you hold me once more, and to hold and look upon your child with me as well.</em><br/><br/><em>Love, Wyn</em><br/><br/>Jorym stared at the page, unsure how he felt, a baby? With the beautiful sin’dorei mage he had meet eight months ago? The paladin looked around the square, and stood, then headed for his office. When he arrived, he went in closed the door, and sat down and began to write a reply.<br/><br/> ***********<br/>Zyss crumpled the letter in her hand, preparing to throw it away, but she stopped. It was the baby’s birthright, his father wanted to see him, to hold him; and longed to see Wyn as well. She would write a reply, and let him know when she would bring little Aris to Dalaran.

It looked to be another lonely night away from her Leon. The night itself was beautiful, warm with a hint of a breeze, the expansive sky overheard full of stars that lit up the heavens. The weary paladin bought a glass of Dalaraan white, and went upstairs to think and worry about the man she missed so much. <br/><br/>Where was he? What dangers did he face, and would he be able to return to her? They all pressed against her mind. She took a sip of her wine, and placed the glass on the table beside her, when she noticed a shadow on the stairs. At first it was a mere glance, but there was something familiar about that profile, and she rose slowly from where she sat. <br/><br/>Already her heart was beating faster as she knew who it was, she recognized him, and rushed into his arms with a happy cry. Leon! Her Leon was here, and she held him tight within her arms. Her soft feminine body melted against his battle hardened form, and she could feel tears of happiness flow down her cheeks. Jen'tira looked up into his face, and he leaned down to kiss her. And she fell into Leon's kiss, wanting it to never end, and to be here in his arm always.<br/><br/>“Don’t cry, my goddess, I bring you news.” Oh, how she had longed to hear his strong voice and a part of her curiosity was piqued. She wondered if it was good news, like another week together as they had been in the spa, or if it wasn’t such good news, as he would be gone another two weeks, and she would be worrying again. Jen looked up at her Leon expectant. “My love, we can be together, no more waiting,” as he brushed the tears from her eyes, “you will be going with me.” <br/><br/>Jen’s arms held Leon tight, as she embraced him. This was good news indeed, never to leave his side, to watch over him, and to love him. She sigh a deep sigh of relief as she laid her head on his shoulder. His arm came around her, and he kissed her forehead, as she snuggled close to him. Jen’tira could hear his heart beating, and she loved the sound. She looked up at his ruggedly handsome face, and whispered, “What of our wedding, Leon? Must we put that on hold yet again?”<br/><br/>When he turned and gazed into her eyes, Jen could feel something melt deep within her, and nothing but love filled her heart. Leon’s smile was so warm and loving, “We shall have your wedding, my goddess. I am happy to stand before a justice to have you as my wife; however you deserve the wedding you have always wanted, always dreamed.” <br/><br/>Jen’tira blinked once and then again. He would wait, and give her what she wanted? The only thing she wanted was Leon, the sooner the better. Her voice was strong as she spoke, “I would stand before a justice if it meant I could marry you tomorrow, Leon. I don’t need the pomp and circumstances, I need you. And if seems too eager, well, I am. I want to be your wife, and I want you as my husband. I would do it tonight if we could.” Her eyes sparkled at the thought of being his wife this very night.<br/><br/>Leon didn’t laugh at her, instead, he held her close to him. “Any paladin or priest could marry us, my dear. I, well, we know of a few don’t we? We could…wait, my friend Illis comes here frequently. Maybe he would marry us? We could ask him. Come with me downstairs, we can wait for him.” So saying, he took her hand and walked down the stairs. Jen’s heart beat fast in her chest at the possibility.<br/><br/>Leon looked around the bar, and then squeezed her hand as he caught sight of his paladin friend, Illis. She barely registered the conversation, as her thought were busy with getting married to Leon. It was happening, they were finally doing it. They would become man and wife, and her heart wanted to burst from her chest. “Are you ready?’ Illis asked. She nodded her head, and a small yes followed. She looked up at her Leon, was it possible? Could he have looked any more handsome as he did right now? <br/><br/>They held hands, and often squeezed them, as Illis began the ceremony. And when they exchanged vows, she knew that Leon was the romantic man she would live and love the rest of her days. It seemed so long, yet in only a few moments, Illis was telling Leon to kiss the bride. And can you belief it? I blushed as I kissed my husband for the first time. But it certainly won’t be the last time.

The undead blood elf clad in the dark ominous armor of a Death Knight paced back and forth waiting for the crackle of the communication stone announcing the paladin’s departure. This one was marked for death per the Master’s instruction, and Lucifearyx would not disappoint him. He would crush the light out of this paladin, and watch the life slowly ebb from his body. His lifeless body was to be dumped on the doorstep of the Cirque’s owner, Vivieka Blacktalon. <br/><br/>The Death Knight stopped pacing, and stood staring across the green fields and farms spread out before him. And a smile came to him as he thought of them all burning and falling under his plated gauntlet. As he thought about the future a loud crackle and pop came over the stone he held in his hand. <br/><br/>“Number One and Number Two, he’s leavin’, he’s leavin’ right now! Heading west…wait, no, he turned, he’s headed south, the target is movin’ south!” the goblin’s voice excited as he yelled into the communication stone.<br/><br/>Lucifearyx strode to the armored mount he rode, and climbed up into the saddle, as he yanked the reins the large bat shrieked loudly, and leaped into the air. The knight had some inkling as to where the paladin was heading, however the other two would find him and set him down on the ground, then wait for his arrival. His smile grew wider at the thought of slaying Neryth Whitestaff. Lucifearyx flew off laughing in the wind excited to be doing his master’s bidding.<br/><br/>Neryth had only been flying a few moments when he realized he had forgotten a gift he had bought for Pfaedra, his beloved fiancé. He turned around and headed towards the little house they had been using, with the intent of possibly buying as their own little love nest. As he banked over the forest to sweep in for a landing, he saw smoke rising from the back of the house. As soon as his steed landed, Neryth jumped off and headed for the door.<br/><br/>The door burst open and a coughing goblin came rushing out with a weird assortment of Fae’s clothes and a few sundry items. He skidded to a stop as he saw the paladin coming towards him. “Hey, yer supposed to be going somewhere, ain’t cha?”<br/><br/>“What have you done, goblin?” the paladin asked, as he pulled forth his sword and shield, and looked over the goblin’s shoulder as fire raged through the dwelling.<br/><br/>“Nuthin’, I ain’t done nuthin’,” the goblin said dropping his loot, and pulling two daggers on the paladin. A sneer came to the goblin’s face; he would gut this fish quickly, and get outta here as fast as he could. Somehow he knew Lord Lucifearyx would be finding out right about now that his pigeon was roosting right back here. He crouched low to give the holy warrior less of a target to strike at.<br/><br/>Neryth struck quickly, as the light shimmered all around him in a golden haze, the tip of the sword plunging into the goblin’s shoulder. The goblin twisted off the sword with a wince, and stabbed at the paladin, however both were blocked by the blasted shield the paladin carried. <br/><br/>“Why, goblin, why burn our home?” Neryth asked.<br/><br/>“Orders are orders, and I ain’t one to question them, pigeon.” Even as he answered the goblin launched himself at Neryth, one attack blocked by the damnable shield, the other going to the paladin’s right-side, and missing completely. ‘This just ain’t my day’, the rogue thought.<br/><br/>The experienced warrior slashed at the goblin, and hit a vital spot, watching a deep darkening of blood well up from the wound. The goblin faltered, and fell, gasping. “Yer not done yet, pigeon…I can see me friends arriving now.” He smiled then his face relaxed as death took him.<br/><br/>The paladin spun around and watched the two dark knights as they slowly descended, and dismounted in front of him. ‘This isn’t going to be good,’ he thought. <br/><br/>The knights stood looking at the paladin, each of them smiling. He stood waiting in front of the burning remains of his home, his weapon drawn and shield at the ready. They shook their heads as they drew their long heavy blades; these Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes just never learned.

The lounge in Dalaran was fairly empty and Fae looked around for the umpteenth time to make sure she was in the right place. What was keeping Neryth? She had left him a note as to where she would be going. She expected him to join her. He probably got delayed with some paladin stuff. <br/><br/>Drumming her fingers on the table she looked up as the barmaid came to ask if she needed anything. "I need my mate. He should be here. Maybe he got sent elsewhere? Oh dear, it's just like the chain of command to separate us." she fumed for a few minutes then declared. " Idiots!! I swear I will twist that fool Magister's goatee into a knot if I find out he did this deliberately! If you see a handsome red haired paladin come in here looking for me, tell him I went back home to check on him. If I do not find him at home, I will be back here later today.'<br/><br/>Fae moved to an open area outside the Inn and channeled a portal to Silvermoon. The portal shimmered and deposited her in the mage section of the city. Not even stopping to chat, Fae dashed out the door and to the ramp. Heading towards the nicer section of the city towards their home she saw flames and her eyes widened in shock. "Neryth! Where are you? " she whispered as she called for her hawkstrider and took of as fast as the poor beast could go.<br/><br/>The smoke and flames were thick, but Fae could see two dark figures heading towards the house, and Neryth in front of it.! She had not been spotted by any of them yet. Caution ruled her mind as she stopped and studied the situation. Without too much hesitation she called forth her water elemental and directed it to put out the fire, She gathered her magic and conjured a ring of frost in front of her. It would serve as a trap should her magic bolts flying at them turn their attention to her. If they stepped on it they would be frozen solid and she could deal with them later.<br/><br/>Then she smiled as she sought to catch Neryth's eyes. Using a well planned signal she waited for him to begin the fight. She would hit the death knights from behind with deadly bolts of arcane magic. She grinned as she conjured a cloud above the battle that would rain ice spears down on the battlefield, slowing them and making it easy for Neryth to battle them.

A golden aura of the Light surrounded the paladin as his left arm threw the shield held there. A grim smirk crossed his lips as he heard the satisfying double thuds against the two death knights before him. But they had not been idle either as one brought his gauntlet up to bring several diseases upon his foe. Neryth shivered and sighed as they began to spread through him, while the othe knight pointed at the dead carcass of the goblin. <br/><br/>The remains of the goblin twisted and groaned as its appearance changed and a ghoul stood where the goblin's remains had once lay. The dark souless eyes of the ghoul stared at Neryth, then tilted it head at him. The voice was unlike anything the paladin heard as it slowly smiled a snaggled-tooth grin and said, "Pigeon?" <br/><br/>The blood elf crouched, as his lips moved in a silent prayer, and the ghoul scurried over to attack him. The ground grew hot and the ghoul screamed in outrage as the ground seemed to burn his feet and body. The first knight moved towards the paladin as well, and felt the sanctity of the ground as he crossed it. "You'll need to do better than that, paladin" it roared as the large two-handed sword slammed into Neryth's shield.<br/><br/>The second knight stepped back, as the holy ground burned him as well. He stared at the paladin, then raised his hand to point at the holy warrior. "You are making me angy, but it shall be your blood that boils!" Neryth moaned deep in his chest as he felt the very blood within him begin to boil. And clenched his sword as a flash of light swept through him and cooled his blood and strengthened him. <br/><br/>So intent on the healing was he, that the ghoul tore across his back with long filthy claws. Fortunately, the enchanted plate armor protected him, and Neryth shrugged it off. Turning, and looking at the three opponents before him, the paladin prayed a silent prayer for help.

The death knights began attacked Neryth and Fae felt her heart leap into her throat. She knew he was protected by the Light, but she was not about to let him fight alone. Whispering words of arcane she lifted her hands in the air and the clouds above started sending down sleet and ice spears. Crashing into the death knights with deadly force.<br/><br/>Her water elemental began pelting them with jets of water. The fire out and the smoke beginning to drift away. Fae watched closely to make sure the death knights were not aware of how close she was to them. Her effectiveness was only good as long as she did not get them to attack her. The ring of frost on the ground would stop them cold if they came towards her, but it would not last long. <br/><br/>She was almost glad Neryth had not spotted her yet. She did not want to distract him. He needed to concentrate to fight. Let them all think the weather was helping the paladin. she hid behind some shrubs and continued to send ice and snow down on the death knights. She watched them intently, if they so much as turned around and headed towards her she would fade from sight. Invisibility was a trick mages often used to disconcert the enemy.
