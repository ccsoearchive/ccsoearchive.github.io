Kassyndrah felt like she was floating, her feet barely touching the ground as she made her way home after time with Illisidel. The huntress felt like she was bursting with joy. Illisidel loved her! She could scarcely believe it.<br/><br/>Her neighbours gave her a strange look as she hummed and skipped her way inside. Kassyndrah ignored them. What did she care about their opinion of her? They had all forgotten what it was like to be young and in love anyway.<br/><br/>She closed the door behind her and rested against it, a broad smile on her face. A thought crossed her mind and she pushed away from the door, heading for her desk. She sat on the chair and pulled a leather bound journal from the drawer. She turned to a blank page and began to write.<br/><br/><em>Is it possible for me to feel so light, so giddy and so sad at the same time? It must be, because I'm feeling like that. Illisidel loves me! Me! I couldn't believe it when I heard it, even when he repeated it, I found it hard to believe. But he does.<br/><br/>It hurt so much to have to say good bye to him. All I wanted to do was take him home and spend the night with him. I think he felt the same way. At least he said he didn't want to be apart from me. It was so hard to not pull him into my arms and love him the way I wanted. I promised myself though, after that practice where we kissed in the rain, that I wouldn't rush it. I told myself that I would let him set the pace of our relationship.<br/><br/>We decided to keep Mina and Rivi in the dark as much as possible. Although I fear they already suspect the truth, it is going to be fun to see how long it takes them to work it out properly. Still, how Illis and I are going to keep this secret, I have no idea. For now, we have the song we are working on together as an excuse to get some time alone, but that won't last for long, and it's not an excuse we can use very often.<br/><br/>But that is all details. Right now, all I want is to feel his arms around me and his lips on mine. The rest can take care of itself.</em>

Nestled in the tent with the flaps down and tied shut, Rivi and Mini slept. Blissfully it seemed, the soft sounds of snoring came from the closed tent. The dream came as it often did, starting off as the usual sweet rehash of the day and hope for the future.<br/><br/>Riavis was in control now more than he ever was. Thanks to Vivi giving him the reasons to continue with his training. Demons were fickle creatures, they lied, cheated and influenced their masters in every way possible. It was one of the reasons Riavis did not like to call on them. No way did he trust them to tell him everything, nor to give him the whole truth when he asked.<br/><br/>He preferred to use the other spells at his command, the fire, curses and life stealing spells that others feared so much. It strengthened him and made him strong. Another reason was his youth and vigor. What Mina did not know was the life that Rivi drained from enemies kept him strong and virile. It was something he found out early in his training. It was a closely guarded secret.<br/><br/>Just as he started enjoying the dream of him and Mina starting their own brand of fire magic, something tugged at the edge of his consciousness. An urge, tickled at the back of his mind. A subtle nudge at first, but it grew stronger...until it worried at his mind like the crying of a lost kitten. Rivi mumbled in his sleep, "No...not now...later...not a good time." his voice slurred with sleep. Restlessly he tossed and turned, pulling blankets away from Mina and rolling into them, trying to bury the now strident urges.<br/><br/>But it was no use and he finally woke up in a cold sweat. In spite of having all the blankets he was cold. Mumbling something incoherent he threw the blankets off and grabbed his robe. He took time to cover Mina up, not even paying attention to whether she was awake or not. Pulling boots on and grabbing his staff he went out into the cold night. <br/><br/>Stars overhead were bright and the air was crisp, but the moon was not up. It was very dark when he made his way through the darkened camp to the elevator. He did not have to go far from the base of the bluffs. The harpy nests were along the western hills surrounding the valley. For two hours he slaughtered harpies, until their stringent cries were stilled. Nothing but feathers and broken eggs littering the ground. The wolves knew better than to approach for a feast until he was done. Breathing hard and now sated with the souls of the harpies, he stopped to gather a handful of beautiful feathers, thinking to have Ginik make something for Mina out of them.<br/><br/>The trek back to the bluff was quick and quiet. The elevators worked non stop day and night. He slipped into the tent and took off his boots and robe, settling down beside Mina who still slept, unaware that he had gone. At least he hoped she had not noticed.

<em>Zyss was so tired, she felt alone and unable to go on. The shaft of light was waning, and one crystal was darkening. The other pulsed with light that became brighter and brighter. The demons shrieked and wailed as the light shielded her from their attacks. Zyss lay her head on the floor, as she felt weaker and weaker.</em><br/>******************************************************************<br/>Confusion reigned in the hospital. Some crazy woman had come in looking for her friend, and demanded to see her. All their patients had others taking care of them, and visiting, there was no lone patient...wait, the one from two days ago, could it be?<br/><br/>"Zyss, Zyss! It's me! ZYSS!" the mage screamed at the body laying on the table. Wyntar could see the paleness of Zyss' skin and she worried. Her hand reached out to hold Zyss, and Zyss felt cool. Wyn could feel tears welling in her eyes, as she gazed down at the face she had come to love and know as much as her own. She gently squeezed Zyss' hand, and grasped it.<br/><br/>"Zyss," Wyn whispered softly, "don't go...come back to me...please, Zyss...don't...go." She set her forehead on Zyss' shoulder as she began to cry and sob.

The last few days had been hard on the white-haired mage. It had been an emotional roller coaster, as she watched her lover come close to dying. She lay beside Zyss in her...their bed, slowly stroking the long red hair, knowing just how close she had come to losing her. Wyn looked at the pretty warlock, and wondered what she would have done if she had lost her. She closed her eyes and shook her head slightly, she didn't want to think about it.<br/><br/>Zyss lay snuggled close to Wyntar, her head resting on the mage's shoulder. She lay there awake taking in the gentle fragrance of Wyn's perfume. It was an intoxicating scent of hibiscus and something else, but it was the scent she connected to Wyn, and that was all that mattered. She turned her head slightly to kiss Wyn's shoulder, and used her arms to pull herself closed to the mage.<br/><br/>"Ah, so you are awake then?" Wyn smiled and said. Zyss merely nodded in Wyn's shoulder, and remained silent.<br/><br/>"Shall I get us some breakfast, love?" Wyn's voice was light and warm. Instead of saying anything, the warlock, pulled herself as close as possible to Wyn, and lay a leg over Wyn's own to prevent her from leaving.<br/><br/>Wyntar's voice was calm but concerned, "Zyss?". The warlock had been like this since coming home, clinging to Wyn, and while the mage delighted in the contact, she was worried that there maybe some issues for Zyss to still work out since being in the hospital.<br/><br/>"I love you." Zyss' voice was quiet and faint.<br/><br/>Wyn kissed the top of the warlock's head, and whispered back, "I love you too, Zyss. Very much in fact." She felt her nodding into her shoulder. <br/><br/>"Me too. Wyn...?"<br/><br/>"Yes, Zyss."<br/><br/>The warlock was silent a moment, then Wyn could feel her setting up, and she smiled as the red-haired love of her life gazed into mage's eyes. Wyn could see there was something important Zyss wanted to say, she could read it in her eyes, and the way her face looked. She waited patiently for Zyss to continue.<br/><br/>"Wyn, I have something to ask of you. Don't answer right away, think about it, okay? I know we have only just begun to explore this love we have for one another, and I do love you. And I know we are relatively young and have a lifetime ahead of us. But I don't know if I would be here today without you in the hospital beside me. And I heard them, the nurses talking that is. You never left my side those last three days. Not once."<br/><br/>Zyss took a long breath, and looked into Wyntar's eyes, "What I'm trying to tell you...or ask you is...would you consider marrying me?"

From the pages of my Journal:<br/><br/>Alysara and Kier'Ali are two most beautiful babies I have ever seen. Light, I'm a father!<br/><br/>Kel'tira is resting well, and I shall spoil her as much as I can. I could see it in her eyes she was tired, and worn out, and yet still managed to look more beautiful than I can ever say. She is and always will be the love of my life.<br/><br/>Kier'Ali, my son, I look at you and I can only hope you will be the best whatever you want to be in this life. He sleeps soundly, Kel'tira tells me he does that quite well. I cannot help looking at him and seeing future generations of Sunblazes looking so much like him. I am so proud of him, and he's only a few days old.<br/><br/>Alysara, my beautiful daughter. I watch your eyes as they take in everything around you. And when you smiled that very first time, you stole your daddy's heart. Will you be a daddy's girl? I am willing to spoil you so much. Where can I find a pony?<br/><br/>They are so much like their mother. I see her eyes, and she sees my nose, and we see two little Sunblaze babies that will be loved and cared for by two loving parents. When I held them both in my arms, I found myself falling in love with each of them, over and over again.<br/><br/>I spent the evening with my family. Holding and caring for my lovely wife as though she were/is a queen. The babies were quiet, and I enjoyed cuddling and snoodling with the wife, before she finally fell asleep in my arms. She did so good...I find seeing as the mother of my children exciting. She is so good with them, and I can see the love she has for the twins in her eyes.<br/><br/>So begins the process of parenting, and my life will be ever changed by their arrival. I relish the challenge.

Illisidel Lightsun sat at his piano, thinking over the night's events, he had gone with Mina, and Kass to the Faire, to inspect the stage to make sure it was large enough for everyone to perform. Unfortunately for the paladin the Chieftans, a Horde musical group known for playing the Faire, were about to play, he could have handled the music, despite the fact he found it to be mere noise. However, it was Kass, and Mina talking up one of the band members that made the paladin walk away, jealousy, it was a brand new emotion for him. Made worse by Kass, teasing him, by talking about other handsome men she had sen around the Faire, it angered him at the time. He had not spared a second glance for another woman since he confessed to Kass, not that he was one to do such things anyway, the only other woman he had looked at was Mina, and that was simply to make sure he kept the tempo of the song just right.<br/><br/>The whole ordeal had put him into a sour mood, made worse when Rivi joined them, his constant bragging, about his bedroom activities had soured the paladin even more. Eventually he couldn't take it anymore, and stormed off before he said, or did something he would regret, as he tended to do when he was upset, he went to look out over the sea, any body of water would do, but the sea was definitely his favorite. The gentle lapping of the waves, tended to calm him, but not this time, no this time all he wanted to do was scream, to curse fate for making him feel this way. He had thought he could handle keeping his, and Kass' relationship a secret from Rivi, and Mina, but he couldn't, Kass was just too good an actor, and he was having a hard time distinguishing when she was acting, and when she wasn't.<br/><br/>He told Kass much the same when she came to look for him, Light bless that woman, she did not chastise him, or scold him for being childish, no she simply listened, and understood. She had been struggling just as much as he, to not embrace each other, when in front, of Rivi, and Mina, neither of them could take it. So they had purposefully revealed the true nature of their relationship, knowing Mina, and Rivi were watching nearby, it was embarasing, but oh so satisfying. Their secret was not the only one placed out in the open, as they had all revealed to Rivi, they knew what he was, a warlock. Thanks to Kass, Illis had discovered that mistakes don't define a man, and neither does his magic, at least not right away. No Rivi may be carefree, and overly flirty, but he was a good man, and he had told the warlock just that. There were no more secrets between the four of them, this night they renewed their bond of friendship, and it was stronger now because of it, their love for each other he believed had grown both he, and Kass, and Mina, and Rivi. The paladin smiled as he began to play the piano, and sing.<br/><br/>((http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTtgVSxfr5M))<br/><br/>Later he sat at his desk, and put pen to page.<br/><br/><em> Tonight had started out rocky, but in the end, the events have just increased my love, and adoration for Kass. I also believe it has increased the love the four of us have as friends, no more secrets. Everything out in the open, Kass, and mine's relationship, Rivi being a warlock, everything was out in the open, at least everything that was comfortable. I still get the feeling Mina, is hiding something from us, but I will not pry it is not my place, no I will not pry into her past, but I pray Rivi does eventually. Whatever Mina has been through I think Rivi, can make her forget it, and all of us together can replace any bad memories she may have with new, and happy ones.<br/><br/>Still now that my relationship with Kass is out in the open, will Rivi put pressure on me to take the next step. Knowing him the answer is probably yes, though he will pass it off as mere teasing, and I shudder to think what ideas Mina, may put into Kass' head, when they are alone. I can see the love Mina, and Rivi have for each other, a love they express in the late hours of evening. I know Kass, is bold, and probably wants to take that next step in our relationship, but everything is still so new to me, can I even take that next step? I want to make Kass happy, and I can't help, but wonder how much she is struggling to not take the next step for me, oh Light what do I do?</em>

It was the disturbance outside that caught her attention, Vivi mumbled sleepily. "What in fel is going on?" Struggling to get her robe as she crawled out of her bed. The stammering of a Tauren brave got her attention as she opened the flap of the tent.<br/><br/>"Lady Blacktalon, forgive m-me...I m-must ask..c-can you rein in...that apprentice or whatever he is?" the brave pointed to the hills on the western side of the mesa.<br/><br/>Vivi walked to the edge of the bluff and chuckled as she watched the flashes of fel fire and the unmistakable odor of sulfur drifted on the wind. "He is feeling his oats, Tauren. He must be celebrating something. I suggest you direct him to whatever enemies the Tauren have rather than asking me to slow him down. Perhaps he needs some daytime exercises however, so he does not disturb the sleep of the camp. I will speak to him."<br/><br/>The hills were soon quiet and Riavis came back to the Bluff, feeling sated once more. He was quite surprised to find Vivi standing outside his tent. "Lady Blacktalon? Please...not here, Mina is asleep inside.." he whispered as he led her farther away from the tent. <br/><br/>"Riavis, I am not going to hide anything from you or Mina. If she is asleep that is fine, but you should know your middle of the night wanderings are disturbing the Tauren. You need to be exercising your cravings during the day, stop trying to make up for them in the night. I suggest you take your friends out to the wilderness and show them how well you are progressing in your training. That way we can all sleep better at night. Now go to bed and do something tomorrow that sates your needs during the day. Understood?" she was stern but not uncaring. Her words were loud enough for Mina to hear if she woke up.<br/><br/>Riavis blushed and nodded, "Yes, Ma'am. I will do that. Good night and sorry if you were disturbed." he went back to his tent and crawled in beside Mina. Wrapping his arms around her and murmering softly. He was a bit wary of asking the others to join him in his exercising of his powers. But they had accepted him and assured him he was fine with them. He went back to sleep, he would ask them tomorrow.

His soft evergreen colored eyes surveyed area all around him, noting the dragonhawks and lynxes moving about. The rush of the falls behind him surrounded him in a heavy percussion. Just as the simple cry of the loons off the lake in front of him set his soul at ease. Twilight was settling in before the sunset arrived. This was his favorite time and place to relax and think things through. <br/><br/>Tomorrow he would be leaving this place behind as he went to seek his fortune in another land. He had heard the jungles of Stranglethorn held surprises at every turn, and the land was a menagerie of animal life waiting to be hunted. He hoped he had heard right, and that there was still a chance for him to find out. <br/><br/>He had grown tired of the Scourge, and the various forms of undead it harbored in the Scar. There was no honor is killing things that were already dead. And the wretched smell was enough to make Echy sneeze. He leaned over and stroked the great cat's fur. He would be depending on him to help him out in that jungle. And the lion purred at the attention Isik gave his ears.<br/><br/>Tomorrow. His life began a new, tomorrow.

Wyntar stared at the warlock, not even blinking as the impact of what Zyss had asked slowly sank in. Her first inclination was to take the woman into her embrace, and kiss her face while saying "yes" over and over again. Her heart was pounding quickly in her chest as the pretty green eyes of the warlock watched her carefully.<br/><br/>Wyn's face remained thoughtful, as she pondered the sudden request. There had been a change in Zyss' demeanor, a subtle change, but one she could feel as she was so close to her. So, was this asked out of desperation or was there something else? Wyntar knew Zyss loved her. It was not just a physical thing between them, but a deep emotional caring and respect for one another.<br/><br/>And what of the paladin Kreindis? He just wasn't someone Zyss would leave or forsake lightly. Zyss had told Wyn she still loved him, and she also loved Wyntar. So why this sudden need or urge to marry her. Wyn took a deep breath, smiled at Zyss warmly, and held her arms out to hold her.<br/><br/>Zyss came into Wyn's arm willingly, her own arms wrapping around the mage too, and hugging her close to her. Wyn kissed Zyss' cheek, then kissed her lovingly on the lips. She pulled away and looked into the warlock's eyes, this was going to be hard, and she hoped Zyss would understand. <br/><br/>"No, Zyss, I won't marry you at this time." Zyss stiffened against the mage. "It isn't that I don't love you. Light, you know I adore you so much. It doesn't mean I won't marry you later in time." Zyss relaxed against Wyn, her body warm and soft.<br/><br/>"Zyss, what of Kreindis? What of the tall handsome paladin? Are you so easily dismissing him for me? You just said that you still loved him the other day. I won't consider marrying you until you talk with him and straighten things out with him. I won't have a paladin after me because I took his girl." Zyss giggled and nodded into Wyn's shoulder and neck. <br/><br/>Wyn held her close, her voice emotional and rough, "I want to be your spouse Zyss. I want to have you in my life as much as you want to be in mine. I love you so much, Zyss. We...we just need to work out the details, beloved. Then we shall have each other, okay?"<br/><br/>Zyss whispered softly up to Wyn, "Yes, my love, I do understand. I'll talk with Krei. And I will treat you like a queen, and you won't be able to turn me down next time." Zyss stroked Wyn's cheek, "I love you, Wyn, with all my heart."

The icy winds of Northrend blew through Naerdiels office, knocking papers off an ornate desk. She stood on the balcony overlooking the prison she had been charged with. As always her manner as grim as the name she had taken. Being a Death Knight a once beautiful smiling face in life now only reflected a mournful expression. <br/><br/>A door opened in the room and another Death Knight entered and glowered at the mess of paper swirling about. “I am not cleaning this up.” <br/><br/>“Suki.” Naerdiels voice a held a hint of impatience. “I’m leaving for a time.”<br/><br/>The human Death Knight sat in a chair and observed her Warden at a distance. “Well…this is…unexpected.” There was a hint of surprise in her voice, the woman smiled. “I thought you were keeping yourself in exile?”<br/><br/>Naerdiel closed her eyes and turned to her friend. “My duty to my family calls.”<br/><br/>Suki’s eyes narrowed. “I guess I should pack then.”<br/><br/>The Sin’dorei’s expression hardly seemed to change. “You must stay here and-“<br/><br/>“Bah! One of the others can do it…I want action.” Suki slams her fist down on the table and sports a wicked grin. <br/><br/>“Very well. I have somewhere I need you to go anyway.” Naerdiel sighs, leaves the balcony and hands her friend a piece of paper. “I shall be headed to Silvermoon…and then perhaps the circus.”<br/><br/>The human woman reads the note with a nod and rises from her chair. At the door she reaches for the handle and hesitates. “The circus…?”

The hunter moved gracefully through the dense foliage of the jungle, his deep evergreen eyes scanned the ground for spoor, and he crouched down when he heard a most peculiar sound. It seemed to be the cross between a roar and a scream, something totally out of his experience. Isik slowly parted the leaves to peer around the clearing before him.<br/><br/>It looked to be well over nine feet tall, with a rough lizardlike hide. It stood upright on two enormous well muscled legs, but the forelegs looked small and frail. One thing Isik knew this was a carnivore. The teeth were almost as long as daggers, and it looked to have two rows of them in its great maw. The frail forelegs had long sharp claws, as did the long powerful legs. Trailing behind it was a long slender tail that seemed to balance it as it walked.<br/><br/>Echy made a low growl and looked at this ancient nature's killing machine, feeling a fierce competition in the food chain with this large lizard. For to the lion, that's what it smelled like, much like the great crocolisks and monitors it had once hunted in the Northern Barrens. The great cat felt no fear as it watched the creature, taking in its movement, and the way it hunted.<br/><br/>The thing made a low growl deep in its throat, as it seemed to be patrolling the area. Isik could see small decaying piles of meat still clinging to bleached bones around the area. The blood elf cautiosly removed several arrows and thrust them into the soft ground preparing to see just what kind of a fight this thing would put up.<br/><br/>Even as the hunter prepared, the small movement he made attracted the exceedingly sharp eyesight of the raptor. It let loose its challenging cry as it pivoted on its two powerful legs and made several large strides that put it nearly on top of the sindorei hunter.<br/><br/>Even as the raptor spun and moved, the grey shadow of the lion moved swiftly to intercept the raptor. Echy jumped on the neck of the beast, his claws seeking purchase on the scaley hide, as his fangs sunk deep into the strong neck muscles of the raptor. Isik drew back and let arrow after arrow loose into the exposed breast and stomach of the raptor. <br/><br/>The raptor easily shook off the lion, as it sought out Echy's warm flesh to tear into. The white lion crouched preparing to attack, as more arrows flew and struck the raptor. The creature lunged forward and sunk its great long teeth deep into the lion, and Echy let out a great roar of pain, as the raptor shook it in its mouth, savorying the blood that it could now smell and taste.<br/><br/>The poisoned tips of a few of the arrows were starting to have an affect on the raptor as it moved more sluggishly, and Isik continued to let the sharp barbed arrows fly, as he stood and fired then one after the other. The lion went for the throat of the raptor, his great jaws clamping down on the pulsating jugular of the tall creature. But the fight was far from over.<br/><br/>The frail upper arms of the raptors sunk deep into the lion's white fur, and sliced through muscle and organs. And Echy clung desperately to the throat and jungular willing it to topple to the ground. Isik began firing at the head of the beast, several of them whistling past the lion to strike vital organs and even taking out one of its eyes. As the reptile finally succumbed to the poison, and blood loss, Echy fell to the ground, a low moan escaping its bloodied mouth.<br/><br/>Isik rushed over to move his hands gently over his friend's body, speaking the words he had learned and feeling the torn muscles and pierced organs slowly begin to knit together. His hands stroked the great cat's white mane, and he spoke gently to him. Isik then reached into one of his side pouches to retrieve the vial he held so dear. The hunter opened the lips of the lion, and poured the healing draft into the maw of the lion. Again, he stroked the great head, speaking softly to his companion.<br/><br/>The affects were good to see, and feel as the lion began to purr softly, and the wounds closed slowly and surely. "I'm thinking we may want to try a different angle on one of these next time, Echy." His voice was low and quiet as he spoke to the lion. "Yeah, definitely try another tactic next time."

She sat at the desk with the inkwell open, and the feathered pen held gently between her fingers. And she tried to write a letter to someone she loved and had promised to love forever.<br/><br/>Zyss remembered the first time she had met the ruggedly handsome paladin. His simple charm was unlike anything she had ever experienced. His arm around her gave her a security she had not felt for quite some time, and that first kiss had been warm and friendly with a promise of more.<br/><br/>There had been the day at the beach, where she found an atrraction to his muscular physique and he could not take his off her. It had been a very long time since she had showed her scars, and where he allowed her to see his own. They were so much the kindred spirits. The kisses were warmer and more passionate too.<br/><br/>Or the night they lay together in each other's arms, in a chaste embrace. She found her heart falling for him and falling hard. She had not slept as soundly as she did that night, her head resting on his chest, his heartbeat the metronome that comforted her, and his strong masculine scent surrounding her. He had given her one of his shirts to sleep in and to allow her to remember that night and his distinct fragrance.<br/><br/>Zyss remembered his voice, how it calmed her, and the afternoon she caught him with another woman. She had not known it was Wyntar, she only felt hurt and betrayed, and she ran away from the sight. He had remained calm as she lashed out at him, never wanting to see him again, her heart breaking at the thought. He explained to her there was only one woman he was interested in, only one woman he thought about, and loved. Herself.<br/><br/>Again she lay with him, only this time she lay on his bare chest, while he spoke of their love, and she fell asleep in his strong arms once more. Her heart was true to this ruggedly handsome paladin, and she could see a future with him. Then Kreindis left to fight in Pandaria.<br/><br/>The length of time seemed to stretch forever as she wore his shirt, and cried into her pillow. She wrote letters only to find them returned unopened. The loss and heartache had taken its toll on her, and she grew despondent fearing he had found another in that far distant land.<br/><br/>Kreindis had returned and searched for her, he too fearful she had found another in his absence. And their embrace was touching, just as the long lingering kiss they shared in the Royal Exchange left many shouting, "Get a room!" He still loved her, and he had thought of no one else but her. His embrace was more loving and he was reluctant to break it, just as he was slow to let her out of his arms as they parted. Her heart had been light and full of joy that Kreindis still loved her.<br/><br/>Tears glistened in the pretty warlock's eyes as she thought of him now. And how he would be brokenhearted by her turning away from him. And she realized just how much he meant to her and how much she loved him too. <br/><br/>Zyss felt torn in two by her own heart, loving them both so much and having to choose. <br/><br/>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzkhpmk-IEc

Soft rays of sunlight filtered in through the tent flap, forcing Illisidel Lightsun into wakefulness, looking around he wondered, why he was not at home. The warmth next to him reminded him quickly, as he smiled down at the woman next to him, that's right, they had loved each other well into the night. She had caled him to the Scarlet Monastery thinking he would be interested to see the Cathedral, and he would be lying if he said he hadn't been. A simple excursion, into history soon broke down, into both of them trying to seduce th eother, and it had worked on both of them. It had taken all of his willpower to carry her, like a princess, out of the Monastery, to a tent he had set up, in preparation for a late night. <br/><br/>It had was the most wonderful memory he would ever have, wrapped in the love of his life's arms, all night. He hoped she enjoyed their night together as much as he did, he silently got up, and got dressed. He wrote down a short note to his love:<br/><br/><em> Dearest Kass,<br/>I do not know what to say, last night was the most wonderful thing that has ever hapened to me, wrapped in your arms all night, it is a feeling I wil never forget. Alas, I cannot be here when you wake, I must return to New Hearthglen, I have some business to take care of. I pray to the Light this won't be the last time we do this, my heart would break if it were, I love you.<br/><br/>Yours Always, Illisidel Lightsun</em><br/><br/>He left the note, along with a single red rose on the pillow next to her, and quietly left the tent. He had not been completely honest in his note, for he had one other stop to make before he returned to Hearthglen. He dismounted from his dragonhawk , at Light's Hope Chapel, digging through his pack he produced several boquets of flowers. No one disturbed him, his expression had turned somber, everyone here knew him, and why he was here, he made his way to the graveyard, to a particular area, and area he had paid for, to bury the remains of his friends, and comrades, he had lost in Northrend.<br/><br/>He no longer blamed himself, but he felt he should still honor their memory, he placed a boquet of flowers on each grave, the tears flowing stronger form each one. After he was done, he stood at the front of th eplot of land, "Well my friends, I hope you are smiling down on me, from wherever you are, I have met the most beautiful, and kind woman in Azeroth. She reminded me that you wouldn't want me to beat myself up, and turn into a somber, and cold person, she reminded me that you would want me to be happy, and I don't think I have ever been more happy than I am now. I love her, I know this for sure, and I pray you watch over both of us, until we meet again in the Light's embrace."<br/><br/>Saluting he returned to his dragonhawk, and made for New Hearthglen, he landed righ toutside of a particular shop, bidding his mount to return home, he entered the shop, and greeted the elderly human who owned it. The man smiled at Illis, "Ah, Illis it's been awhile since you payed this old man a visit."<br/><br/>The elf smiled, "I am sorry I have been preoccupied, which is what brings me here today." The old man raised his eyebrow, and nodded asking him to continue Illis smiled, "You are the best jeweler I know, and I need a couple of things, first a necklace, gold with a locket, with two hearts interwoven on the front, with this picture placed inside." He laid a picture on the counter, showing him, and Kass at the Faire, after they had made up, he had gotten someone to take the picture without Kass knowing, which wasn't easy.<br/><br/>The old man smiled knowingly, "It's about time boy you both look so happy, it shouldn't take me too long, I should have it ready by this afternoon, now what is the other thing you needed."<br/><br/>The paladin blushed, "A ring, silver, with a similar design as the locket, with rubies, and saphires inlaid on the outside edges of the hearts, and a diamond in the center." The old man's eyes widened, but Illis held up his hands to forestall any questions, "I am not planning to give it to her yet, but if things keep going the way they are, I want to have it for when I do decide it's time."<br/><br/>The old man smiled, "Pretty serious huh, well good for you lad, I am glad to see you smiling more, this must be one special woman, to have changed your personality so much."<br/><br/>Illis smiled, "She is th emost wonderful woman, on Azeroth, and I would do anything to make her happy, here is payment..."<br/><br/>The old man waved off the bag of coins, "Lad, this ones on the house, you have done so much for me over the years, I have been waiting for the day you would ask me for something, so I could repay you, come back by this evening, and I should have both pieces ready." Illisdel smiled, and nodded, and left the jeweler's shop to return home.<br/><br/>(1/2)

He sat at his piano, needing to sing, and play out his happiness.<br/><br/>((http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQTndyhJx7Q))<br/><br/>Later he sat at his desk, and wrote in his journal.<br/><br/><em> Is it possible for me to be any happier, than I am right now, is it even possible that someone like me could even be this happy, in the first place. Well, it must be because I am so happy, I could fly, last night spent with Kass, was the best night of my life. I love her more than anything, and I would smite down her foes in a heartbeat, I think she feels the same way about me. Is this what people call true love, I pray it is, I am having two pieces of jewelry made for her, one I will give to her the next time we see each other, the other, well I am just not sure I, or she is ready for me to present that piece to her. I selfishly hope the time when we are ready will be soon, for I am not a patient man when it comes to Kass.<br/><br/>I know we haven't know each other all that long, nor have we been together, but for a few weeks, but I feel that she is the one I have been waiting for. The one who will complete my heart, but I do not want to rush things, but I fear my heart will not let me wait too long. I pray she will accept it, or if she doesn't that it is simply because she needs more time, and if that is the case I will allow her that time, while showering her with more love, than she can handle.

Kassyndrah rolled over onto her side, her long red hair splayed out across her pillow as her hand reached out and brushed something beside her. Her hand travelled along the object as her mind struggled through the fog of sleep to the land of the waking.<br/><br/>She stretched under the covers, a smile playing about her lips as she remembered the events of the previous night. It was so wonderful that it almost seemed like a dream, but it was all so wonderfully real. The memories came back with a rush as she rolled onto her back, luxuriating in the almost sensual feel of the covers on her bare skin.<br/><br/>Illis had surprised her so wonderfully. He had been so caring, so gentle and so gloriously passionate. The huntress smiled and rolled onto her side. The object on the pillow next to her turned out to be a single perfect rose with a note attached. The note made her smile widen as she read it. “I love you as well Illis. Stay safe.”

Fel fire glowed in the small clearing in Eversong, the demon Faden Shadowfury had just summoned disappearing as he sent it back to the Nether. It had taken him nearly all night, but he thought he was beginning to control his power a little better, Lady Blacktalon's advice seemed to be working. The young elf panted, from the exertion, "Still, could my problem have simply been name mispronounciation, no the power is there, other wise I wouldn't be able to summon a more powerful demon whether I accidentally said it's name or not." He sighed, he had almost overstepped his bounds after succesfully summoning his imp, and voidwalker ten times in a row, he had decided to take a risk. <br/><br/>Of course he would not tell Lady Blacktalon, he wasn't sure what she would do to him, if he told her he had deviated from her intructions, even for a moment. The demon he had just returned had been a succubus, a demon he had never attempted to summon until tonight, partly because he knew what they were like. One lapse in concentration, and the demoness would have drained him completely, though the process they tend to do that in, is pleasure. She had tried, to use her powers as a succubus to get him to let her out of the summoning circle he had made, fortunately he had been able to resist until he could send her back. He shook his, "What was I thinking, if I had not followed Miss Blacktalon's instructions, and carefully said the right name, I would probably be dead, with a smile on my face, stupid Fade, stupid."<br/><br/>He slapped himself a few times, before sitting against a tree, and fishing out his journal.<br/><br/><em> I have a new teacher, though she is strict, she is much nicer than the trainers in Silvermoon, though I have no doubt if I directly disobeyed her the consequences would be severe. My teacher is none other than Lady Vivieka Blacktalon, a member of a family on the council, and a powerful warlock to boot, not that she publicizes the fact, but any student of the dark arts could sense her enormous power. She has power both politically, and magically, she cuts an intimidating path, and people she passes look at her with adoration, and it's easy to see why, she is beautiful, perhaps more so than even a succubus, a demon that is supposed to represent the perfect womanly body. I have never seen the appeal of succubi myself, perhaps I am just smart enough to not be taken in by their looks, for I know what they really want.<br/><br/>I am sure Miss Blacktalon would scold me if I ever told her how beautiful I thought she was to her face, thinking it was simply me kissing up. Who could blame her after the confrontation we had tonight, between us, a Farstrider, and some other man who looked to be a mercenary. I don't know what it was, perhaps it was just my proximity to Miss Blacktalon, but I got rather nasty, especially to the Farstrider, the man I couldn't care less about, he had been the one to start things, just because our eyes happened ot meet. Regardless I hold high respect for the Farstriders, even though they are supposed to arrest people like me if we cause trouble, but I still felt bad. I caught up to the Farstrider outside the inn, and apologized, her name was Bryah Starstrider, she was surprisingly easy to talk to once we buried the hatchet. I feel she is someone I can go to if I need to talk, and she will listen, I can't say if we really became, "friends," but I think we made a good start.<br/><br/>Lady Blacktalon wants a progress report, I hope my progress will please her, I don't want to be sent back to my family and risk ridicule, and being disowned. Someone like me will not do well on the streets, if I can keep Lady Blacktalon happy, I am hoping she can not only save me from my own power, but also from my own family. I don't know how, but if I could live with Miss Blacktalon the rest of my life, sure it would be difficult, but it would be a hundred times better than the home I have to go back to now.</em>

The soft rays of the morning sun, peeked in through the tent flaps, the light hitting Illisidel Lightsun right in the eyes. He put his free arm over his eyes, the other cradling the love of his life, he smiled, thinking of last night's events. It had been incredible, the best feeling he had ever experienced, and he wanted more of that feeling. He wanted her by his side for the rest of their lives, he had intended to wait, but after last night his heart would not let him, no tonight at the Armistice Ball, he would propose to her. He could think of no one else he would rather spend his life with, and he was sure Kass felt the same, they were connected now, body, and soul, he couldn't live without her, and he wanted to show her that.<br/><br/>Reluctantly he gently removed her head from his arm, he had some planning to do, he wanted to make sure this would be the best night of her life. Once again he left a note telling her how much he loved her, and that he would see her tonight, and a single red rose. He called for his dragonhawk, and made his way back to New Hearthglen. He arrived at his home in the early afternoon, and immediately went to the safe where he had stored the ring. He took it and placed it on his piano so he could see it, he knew she loved music, he believed more so now that they were together, and she didn't have to remember the pain of her past relationships.<br/><br/>He would write her a song, the setting would be perfect, and he would make the mood perfect. It took him the better part of the afternoon to finish, it wasn't his best work, but he had always been told it was the thought that counted, still he wanted tonight to be perfect, but he was out of time. He had written it to played on both the piano, and guitar, he hoped he would be able to bring her to his home for the first time, but he had made sure to include the guitar just in case, they couldn't make it to his home. He smiled wryly at the thought, two nights in a row, it didn't matter, she was so beautiful, and so sensual. He still had a few hours before the Ball, so he sat at his desk, and put pen to page.<br/><br/><em> Tonight is the night, my heart cannot bear to be apart from her anymore, I need to show her that she is the olny one I want to be with. I am hers forever, nothing, and no one will change that, and I want her to be mine, forever, Light I pray she says yes, but whether she does or not, I will still love her, I will always love her, and I tell her that in the song I wrote for her. I will make sure we stay at the Ball for awhile, but I plan to ask her back to my home, if she says yes, like I hope I expect we will be up until the dawn. I love you Kass, and tonight I will show you just how much.</em>

The morning sun, brought with it warming rays of light, light that seemed to enjoy peeking through a window, and shine directly onto Illisidel Lightsun's eyes. He smiled in greeting to the light, he knew nothing could ruin this day, not being awakened so harshly, not guilt over the past, he even believed he would greet Vivieka warmly if he saw her today. He was ecstatic, he felt like he was on a cloud, floating in a sea of happiness, and bliss. Looking over revealed the reason why, next to him lay the love of his life, and new fiance, to him Kass looked so lovely, as she slept. She had said yes, it was still hard for him to believe, she had agreed to marry him, not just agree, no, she was so overcome with his proposal that she had been speechlees for minutes, before she had finally said the word yes. <br/><br/>His heart had done a backflip of joy, and it wasn't long after that, that they expressed their mutual happiness physically. He wasn't sure when they had actually gone to sleep, but they had both been exhausted, and very satisfied. If the acceptance of his marriage proposal, and love making wasn't enough, she had also agreed, to move in with him. He didn't want to rush, but he found himself having a hard time getting preparations, for her move underway. He smiled down at her, leaning on one arm, he gently kissed her forehead, and got up to get dressed. He would let her sleep, he went to his desk, and pulled out his journal, and began to write.<br/><br/><em> Today my new life with Kass begins, she said yes, thank the Light she said yes, I must be the happiest man on Azeroth at this moment. I hope I can make her equally as happy, no even happier, I want to give her the very best I can. Nothing shall come between us, I love her too much to let that happen. I am not sure when we will tell Rivi, and Mina, and I can hardly wait to see the looks on their faces. Will it be happiness, will it be surprise, I will find out when we tell them. They are our best friends, and once the wedding plans have been set I plan to ask Rivi to be my best man, there is Dalfein of course, but I think he would prefer to be in the audience.<br/><br/>Today, and everyday hereafter shall be perfect, because I have the most beautiful, and perfect woman by my side, I say it again, and I will say it everyday, I love you Kass.</em>

Am I dreaming? Someone pinch me! No! Don't! I might wake up and find this all to be some sort of wonderful dream. I can hardly believe it. If it weren't for the ring on my finger I wouldn't believe it. I'm getting married! Me! The girl that was done with love and other such things is getting married. To a paladin of all people.<br/><br/>I've found the most wonderful man on Azeroth and I can't wait to be his wife. I was so surprised at the ball. Illis could sense that I wasn't having a good time and that I wanted to go hunting. I guess it must have been written all over my face or something. Anyway, he suggested I go hunting and he would meet up with me later, at his home in New Hearthglen.<br/><br/>It was just what I needed. There were so many people at the ball that I found it hard to follow a conversation with anyone, and the noise! The noise was so loud that after fifteen minutes, my head was pounding. I was longing for the relative silence and solitude of the forests.<br/><br/>The hunting trip worked like a charm. After a few hours I was feeling normal again and went in search of Illis. The directions he gave me to his home were perfect and I found it without any trouble. When I arrived, he said he had a couple of surprises for me.<br/><br/>The first was a song that he had written for me. It was so beautiful and sweet. I have to admit to tears of happiness as I listened to it. The second surprise was incredible! When he finished singing. He got down on one knee and asked me to marry him! I was stunned and literally couldn't say anything for a few minutes. Eventually I found my voice again and said Yes!<br/><br/>He put the ring on my finger and I was so excited I kissed him. Our love making last night was incredible. It was as if I couldn't get enough of him and he couldn't get enough of me. Waking in his bed, the smell of Illis still clinging to the pillow was one of the best feelings in the world. I can't wait to get the rest of my belongings and move to share the home of the man I love.
