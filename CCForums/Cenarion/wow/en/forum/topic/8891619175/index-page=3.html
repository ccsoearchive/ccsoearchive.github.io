Friday the 13th - The close of summer<br/><br/>I have always been conservative in thought and in the things I wore. However, Mistress had other plans for me. She has designed a "uniform"that I am to wear whenever I go out, wherever I go. At first I was embarassed to be seen in it. I heard the whistles and catcalls the men gave me, and I was humiliated. <br/><br/>Mistress praised me for doing as she wished, and the praise removed any humiliation I had, or embarassment I had. Now I walk proudly in my uniform, for it please her, and that makes all the difference for me.<br/><br/>I have taken to going back out in the field again, stretching my abilities and skills. And I love it! The freedom of the road, and the respect I earn as I accomplish the simple quests that the people give me. I seek more and more respect and praise from those I aid in life. I cannot help wonder if this is a side effect of my Mistress's training and indoctrination, for I do not remember me enjoying it this much. Nor do I care, how silly of me to even write about it.<br/><br/>The only consequence of my being out on the road, and journeying to new and different place, I am away from her, and that causes an dull ache within me. I miss my Mistress. I know that might seem strange, but she is not cruel nor does she mistreat me...she is Mistress. I long for her words of praise in my ears, and the gentle touch of her fingers and hands upon me. Yet I am to be out here for several more weeks. <br/><br/>I cannot help wonder if she misses me.

She tried to keep busy with her beadwork, painstakingly sewing each bead in the pattern to make it look right. It was a warrior's shirt, made to be a decorated bit of finery for special occasions.<br/><br/>She had heard the rumors of a wedding or two in the Cirque and she was excited. It was always a wonderful thing when two decided to bond their lives together. She had met Pfaedra and found her to be a competent mage with a bright future. She had seen Neryth as he visited with Vivi and wondered why he was so nervous around her. She supposed it was normal for a young male to be that way around his future mother-in-law.<br/><br/>He seemed a very gifted paladin, on par with any of the braves in Thunderbluff who walked the Lightwielder path. She wondered if he was as dedicated as her father. Tataunka was one of the first priests to take up the sword and shield and become a Sunwalker. She missed him greatly. He had fallen at Icecrown and his body never returned from Northrend. <br/><br/>Gini remembered her mother Dancing Moon nearly hysterical when they brought the news. It had only been a couple of months and she had followed her husband. The elders told Gini that her mother had died of a broken heart. Gini was not sure she would ever understand. It was not like her mother deserted her, Gini was already an adult and training as a druid. It must have been a shock for the elder Tauren, to lose her husband and not even have the closure of a burial. She just never got over the grief.<br/><br/>Gini laid the beaded shirt into a woven basket, adding some treats she had made that were favorites in the tribal gatherings. A nice selection of baked goods and a bag of her special blend of herbal tea. She was sure Jakota had liked it, he had said he did anyway. Maybe he was just being polite?<br/><br/>Gini sighed, it would be nice if the young brave would come to visit her again. Perhaps he was just too busy. She set the basket aside and went to gather some more herbs. You can never have enough herbs.

Flight. I had flown using the taxi services, seeing objects below that peaked my interest, only to pass them by because it was not a part of the route. Unfortunately, I found some of those place beyond my reach even from the back a kodo.<br/><br/>No longer am I tethered to someone else's route, for I have wings of my own! I can FLY!!!<br/><br/>Oh, the sensation of feeling the wind beneath my wings, the warmth of the sun on my back, and the joy of flying wherever I wished! I glide on the thermals, and soar higher than the hawk. And I am exhilerated!<br/><br/>For the past few days I found myself searching for herbs. And my eagle eyes seem to find them with me barely conscious of the effort. My pack is full of the fragrant blossoms, and crushed leaves. I head home with the thought of resting, and relaxing a few days...and of Ginik.<br/><br/>I would be telling falsehoods if I said I had not thought of her at all. Her eyes, her deep calming eyes, that stirs my blood at the same time. I remember the richness and tone of her voice, and have yearned to hear it once more...to hear her say my name. Her memory has not been far from my thoughts.<br/><br/>I remember her mentioning she too was a druid...I wonder if she would fly beside me? Allow me to prepare a simple meal? Allow me to speak with her once more? To allow me to...kiss her?<br/><br/>Is she taken? Has another brave claimed her for his own? What warrior has won Ginik's heart? Would she think about me? Could I even dream, dare I even dream...

I ride home to Silvermoon City, a changed woman, no longer under the thrall of a warlock...but held yet by a power much more effective than any spell she could ever cast. If she only knew, if only she would open her eyes and see...<br/><br/>I have done away with the flames and fire I used to cast. Now my spells are more concurrent with the name I bear - ice, snow, and freezing cold. And while my spells may be witness to my name, there is a burning within my breast for one who has created a desire that overwhelms my senses...<br/><br/>I slowly walk the street toward her, <strong>our</strong>, home, and I hesitate. I wonder how she will feel about what I have to say. I know there is or was Kreindis, yet he is far away, and been gone for many months. I am here, and will always be here, will she accept what I have to offer her?<br/><br/>Light, why am I shaking? Zyss....

<em>The apartment is cool and dark, as the young woman walked through to the small study, to sit before a very old and ancient desk. Her hand caressed the old wood, seeking some sort of warmth or comfort from the deep carvings and rich grains of the wood. She set the small candle she carries on an upper shelf, her hand trembled as she lets go of the candlestand.<br/><br/>She bowed her head, as the hot tears well up in her eyes, then fall down her cheeks. Two and a half months, more like three, have passed with no replies or responses to her letters to her heroic paladin. There are even a few returned letters laying upon the desktop, silent evidence of either his not wanting them, or worse his demise. Either way, her heart is breaking at the thoughts, and she sobbed into her hands.<br/><br/>So wrapped up in her own affairs, Zyss did not hear the front door open and close. It is only when two hands rest on her shoulder, and she hears the warm voice filled with concern, does she turn to look into the face of her roommate.<br/><br/>"Zyss? What is it? What troubles you?" Wyntar the mage whispered quietly.<br/><br/>Zyss' trembling hands come up to take and hold Wyn's hands close to her, the tears flowing more quickly. "He doesn't write back, Wyn. He's found someone else, or Light help me, he's dead." She places her head against the mage's wrists, clutching them, and wetting them with her tears.<br/><br/>"Shhh, my dear, shhh, you are crying yourself into a corner." Wyn whispers quietly. She slips a hand free from the warlock's grasp, and comes around the chair Zyss sits in. The mage looks at the young woman, knowing how much Zyss loves Kreindis, her own heart going out to her, as Zyss cries on. She comes close, and allows the woman to wrap her arms around her waist, as Wyntar slowly stroked her hair, and murmured "There, there, shhh, there, there."<br/><br/>Zyss hiccuped and slowly wound down, as her friend comforted her. Her heart was still in turmoil, and she wondered what had become of the man she loved so dearly, who had gone off to war. "Thank you, Wyn, I'm sorry, so sorry..." she whimpered lightly.<br/><br/>"Tsk, tsk, you clean yourself up, and I'll go make us a fresh pot of hot tea, alright? And why is it so dark in here? Open the drapes, let the sunlight in. Goodness, Zyss, what have you been doing while I was away?" The mage chided the warlock lightly.<br/><br/>Wyntar hastened into the kitchen to prepare the water, then cried into the dishtowel while waiting for the water to boil. She would not, she could not talk to Zyss now. She would have to contain her own emotions, her own love, while Zyss grieved over the handsome paladin. Wyn would care for her, watch over her, and hold her through the rough road ahead.<br/><br/>She dried her eyes as the water boiled and set the cups and the pot on a tray. She lifted her head and smiled, a forced smile, but it would warm when she was with Zyss again. "Tea's ready, dear, where shall we sit and drink it? Hmm?"</em>

<em>Zyss and Wyntar talked well into the night. When they finally decided to retire, Zyss asked Wyn to lay with her for a moment or two, and the mage nodded. <br/><br/>Zyss' head lay in Wyn's lap, the warlock sound asleep. Wyn continued to stroke the warlock's soft rich hair, and removed a few errant strands that had settled over Zyss's eyes. She looked down at the peaceful visage of this woman she had come to love. She sighed heavily, happy in the knowledge that the two of them had grown closer, and that Zyss had grown calmer talking with Wyntar.<br/><br/>The mage held nothing but true affection for the little witch. It was true she had been controlled by Zyss for a short time, but she had never mistreated her once. Even though Wyn had evil intent with the young Sindorei woman at one time. Wyn began to think Zyss was too kind and sweet to be a warlock, however, the witch had strength and resolve that Wyn had underestimated. There was more to Zyss than one could see or measure.<br/><br/>Wyntar's fingers softly touched Zyss' one ear, and began to stroke the length of that ear ever so gently. Zyss moved and snuggled deeper into the mage. And Wyntar smiled.</em>

There was a small rise outside of the location the cirque had stopped to practice, and the holy priest set down with his recorder. He primed the long flute-like instrument, and began to play a soft melody. A song of love and devotion, a subject he was growing fonder of with the young priestess Hahnai. <br/><br/>The tune was joyous and seemed to take on a life of its own. Az's fingers flew over the recorder, he was barely conscious of the music as he let the harmony of the notes take him away. Whether it was the lute that Hahnai played or the small enchantment of the recorder, his playing was improving in leaps and bounds. His toe began to tap as the melody captured his spirit, and sent it soaring too.<br/><br/>Azmos didn't know this tune, yet there was something vaguely familiar about it, and he continued to play it, trying to place the song. As the tune slowed, and softly closed, the priest remembered where he had heard it not so long ago.<br/><br/>It had been in Booty Bay, and Hahnai had sung the words while this very tune played out on the lute. Words that had quieted a raucous bar full of drunks and gamblers and held them briefly enthralled. And he had played the same tune, without even realizing it.<br/><br/>Azmos set the recorder down. Pondering the implications of what had just occurred.

From the pages of my journal:<br/><br/>I went to a poetry reading this past weekend put on by the Royal Library. It was...interesting. I went with the lovely Jana, and while the brandy was tasty and warming, I was a bit unsure of the poetry.<br/><br/>Perhaps I didn't not understand all the particulars of the poetry presented, and I was confused on ocassion by the actual library assistants and the hostess of the event. However, I will give them this - it has been four days since the event, and my thoughts still ponder the poetry and personages of the event. That to me is a good sign of a thought provoking event. I shall look forward to the next one with some anticipation.<br/><br/>I happened to run into the lovely Jana last evening. It was on the Royal Exchange, just outside of the bank. She has a bit of a teasing nature, however much of it is lost on me. She did mention a possible musical event for Hahnai and I for the Royal Library.<br/><br/>How fascinating that would be. I cannot help be happy for Hahnai, for I think she needs to spend some time playing again. We have searched the ruins outside of Shatt, and I can only hope Faedra will be able to help Hahnai with the book she received. <br/><br/>I should get out my recorder and practice more with it. I have a program to prepare!

<em>She awoke with the morning light falling across her eyes, and she tucked into the warm body that was entangled with her own. Her first thought was of the man she loved so dearly, but the gentle fragrance of hibiscus told her it was someone wlse.<br/><br/>Wyn was sound asleep, Zys could see and sense that. The mage's arms were wrapped around Zyss, and a leg between Zyss' own pair. However, the pretty warlock found is strangely comfortable, and even felt secure within the mage's warm coccoon. Her head pressed against Wyn's shoulder, hiding from that stray ray of sunshine that had sought her out, and awakened her. <br/><br/>As she did so, Wyn rolled closer to Zyss, blocking out the light, and embracing her closer. She breathed slowly, enjoying the scent of Wyn's perfume, and her warm soft body pressed against her. Zyss thought about the previous night, and how Wyntar had been there to comfort her, and listened to her going on and on about Kreindis.<br/><br/>The lovely mage had even come to console her and hold her in her own bed when she pleaded with her to rest beside her. Zyss had not wanted to be alone that night. Again, Wyntar had done as she asked, without question. Zyss vaguely remembered how Wyn had stroked her hair, and had whispered to her everything would be alright. And the warlock had gone to sleep to the mage's light caress and soft voice.<br/><br/>Wyn had been so kind, and Zyss lightly kissed Wyntar upon her neck. She was surprised when Wyn moaned softly. She softly kissed the mage's neck again, and Wyn sighed a low contented sigh. Zyss gazed at the graceful neck of Wyntar, and this time she blew softly across the skin. Small goosebumps appeared, and the mage responded with a single word, whispered from her slumber...<br/><br/>"Zyss."</em>

She rode her charger away from the goblin tradepost, back to finish the last few jobs she had before going to Silvermoon, back to the arms of her love, Leon. Her skins were full of fresh water, her mount was refreshed, and the woman was in a different frame of mind as she rode off.<br/><br/><strong>A few hours later...</strong><br/><br/>Jen had finished her chores and was on her way back for a nice long bath and a good night's sleep. Her mind wandered and she wasn't aware of her surroundings, until the charger snorted and cried out loudly. Her attentioned snapped to the front of her, where three big burly orcs attempted to gather or grab the tack of the big horse beneath her. <br/><br/>As she reached for her sword, she was thrown from the saddle as another of the orcs grabbed her from a shelf of rock on the canyon wall beside her, and tackled her to the ground with a heavy grunt. The fall took the wind out of her, and Jen'tira's head hit a rock, as she slid into inky darkness she wondered "What the hell?"<br/><br/><strong>Sometime later...</strong><br/><br/>When she awoke, her head throbbed, and she found she was chained to a wall. Her armor was gone, and she wore only the simple undergarments worn beneath them. The cell smelled of old straw, urine, and stale air. She groaned as she tried moving her arms, a dull deep pain shot through her shoulders, and arm sockets.<br/><br/>A deep gutteral growl came from outside the cell, and a stool or chair could be heard being pulled back and a low grunt as someone got up. The shadow was dark and filled the open door of the cell. "Good, you awake. Master be angry if you dead," the simple orc then chuckled deeply at his own joke. <br/><br/>The orc moved into the cell to stand before Jen'tira, "Well, elfie, Master got you." He leered into the awakening face of the paladin, she struggled not to puke from the sharp pain in her arms or breathe in any more of the orc's fetid breath as he stood before her. And failed miserably, as her stomach emptied all over the orc's chest, and feet.<br/><br/>"WHAT?!" He didn't think, he struck out, and she reeled from the heavy punch to her head, and she sagged on the chains that held her. She prepared for more when Jen heard a gurgling. She looked up through pain clouded eyes to see the orc suspended in the air, his own hands pulling at some unseen hands around his throat. He gurgled, and struggled, and a quiet snap filled the cell. And his body went limp. <br/><br/>The body fell with a dead thump, and a dark plated form entered the cell. It looked down at the body, and kicked it aside. He stood before her, and she groaned up at the Death Knight, as he reached out to her, and took her chin in his mailed hand. She could feel unconsciousness coming to claim her as his voice echoed in her fading thoughts, "Where's the egg?"

How long had it been since they/he had been to her cell? She had sheltered herself in the Light, holding on to it, and not allowing the Death Knight to break her. He had tried, Light he had tried. He would never know how close she had come to a broken will. She would rest and rebuild her strength.<br/><br/>Jentira lay on the floor, thirst ever present in her thoughts, followed only by the pain. She didn't hear them arrive. But he spoke to someone and her heart quicken, and she struggled to rise. He was here! Leon had found her! Oh, merciful Light, he had found her.<br/><br/>Even as she struggled to sit up, his strong arms were around her, holding her, and she smiled. Leon presented his waterskin, and she drank from it slowly, looking over the skin into his handsome face. She fought back the tears that threatened to fill her eyes. Leon, he had found her, he had come to recue her.<br/><br/>She leaned against him as he picked her up and carried her. He held her close as they rode to safety. She already was safe there within his arms. And he carried her and laid her on the hammock. She lay there until Jana brought her soup. And she was strengthened by the soup.<br/><br/>Jen rested talking with the scout, until Leon returned. She smiled warmly up at him. As she stood he knelt before her and handed her a small gift wrapped box. She looked down at him as she unwrapped the box, and her eyes grew wide. Leon spoke to her, and asked her the question all women want to hear. <br/><br/>"Yes...yes...yes..." She smiled up at him as his arms wrapped around her. "Yes, Leon, yes."

It was a happenstance meeting by the mailbox. Zyss had been heading for the bank when she saw a vaguely familiar face. The face smiled and said hi. She reminded Zyss of her name, Jana, and they had met at one of the many beach parties that the fellowship had. Zyss smiled and said she remembered them fondly.<br/><br/>"I hear Kreindis is looking for you. He has returned from Pandaria, and wanted to see you."<br/><br/>"Krei? Krei is here?!" Zyss was full of happiness and joy that her paladin had returned.<br/><br/>She explained to the scout that many of her letters had been returned, and she had though Krei had either forgotten her, or had been killed. She hated to think she had thought the worst, but it was what she had thought. The scout reminded her that if Kreindis had been of secret missions or manuevers, the mail may have been sent back on account of that too.<br/><br/>The warlock hugged her and thanked Jana, before rushing off, the banking forgotten, and headed to her apartment.

Leon paced in his family's home in Silvermoon City. It seemed so empty but it was full of memories. Some good. Some bad. Through all those memories however, ran the constant thread of being loved and accepted. <br/><br/>He remembered the pride that his parents had felt when he had told them that he had been accepted into the blood knight training academy. The bitter disappointment that Rhannah had felt the day she discovered her true calling lay with the darker arts and not the ways of the blood knight. He had held her as she cried that whole night, reassuring her that he didn't care where her calling lay. He loved her and was proud of her. <br/><br/>He smiled as he remembered the day Medra was born. Their mother had allowed him to hold his baby sister after she had been wrapped in a soft blanket to keep her warm. Even then, she had shown her independent streak. Minutes old and she was already wriggling her arm out of the blanket. The tiny little arm waved itself about, bopping him on the nose before he managed to catch it and tuck it back under the blanket.<br/><br/>Leon stopped his pacing, brushing aside the tears as he laid his hand on the chair that had been his father's place at the dinner table. He couldn't help wonder if his parents were proud of him, of who he had become and how he had managed to keep the family together, mostly. <br/><br/>It still irked him that Rhannah and Jaella couldn't get along. The two had been close as children, but grew further apart as they grew to be adults. He loved all his sisters equally, but even he had to admit that Rhannah was the one he was closest to. It had hurt to see the distance forming between her and their younger sister. He understood why it was there though. Even in her final years of school, Jaella had started believing herself better than everyone else in the family. Except him. She looked up to him for some reason. Whether it was because of him being the oldest or because he was a Blood knight, he still didn't know.<br/><br/>Leon's eyes strayed to the portrait of his parents that hung on the wall near the table. They were so happy, so in love with each other. A small weight in his pocket reminded him of the box that was stored there. He fished it out and opened the box. It contained a ring, with a single diamond set into the band. He had bought the ring the day after his picnic on the beach with Jen'Tira. Even then he had known that she was the one he wanted to spend his life with. <br/><br/>Jen'Tira. A frown crossed his handsome face as he thought of her. It had been a few days since her last letter and he was worried. She had talked about heading into an are called the Badlands. It was a dangerous area, filled with ogres and black dragons as well as the normal wildlife.<br/><br/>He closed the box and placed it in the safe. Jen was a capable blood knight like himself but there were things that lived in the Badlands that were stronger than her. Things that could beat her and even kill her. He couldn't let that happen! He raced to find Jana, a tracker he knew that had the uncanny knack of being able to find almost anyone.<br/><br/>Together they traveled to the Badlands and scoured the land. He was just about to give up hope when Jana spotted a cave that they had missed earlier. They entered the cave and there was a cell inside! The cell held a woman and as they got closer, Leon's anger flared. As soon as he was in range, he drew his sword and smashed the lock. He almost wrenched the door off its hinges in his haste to get to the woman he loved. It was only the manacles that slowed him down, forcing him to step back as Jana picked their locks.<br/><br/>As soon as she was free, Leon Took Jen'Tira in his arms and held her close, offering her a skin of water to calm her thirst. He was surprised by the fierce wave of protectiveness that washed over him. Never before had he been so scared for another's safety. Never had he wanted to protect the woman he loved as much as he did that moment. He wanted to tear apart every ogre in the Badlands until he found the one that had hurt her. She cuddled in to his arms and thoughts of revenge flew out the window. <br/><br/>He lifted her and carried her all the way to New Kargath, only releasing her to lay her on a hammock. Satisfied that she wasn't seriously hurt, Leon asked Jana to watch over her while she slept. There was something he needed to get from Silvermoon City. <br/><br/>(1/2)

The small box nestled once again in his pocket, he took the first dragonhawk he could back to New Kargath. The flight was long, each second away from Jen'Tira's side an eternity of torture for him. He occupied his mind thinking about the day he had first laid eyes on the beautiful blood knight. Even then he had recognised her beauty, been able to sense a hint of the strength that lay within her. <br/><br/>A strength that reminded him of another girl, from another time. It was laughable how he ever could have thought himself in love with Narella. She was beautiful, strong, intelligent, everything that the future wife of a Blood knight should be. But there was also a vulnerability, a fragility to her that made him want to protect her, to care for her.<br/><br/>He had been devastated when she had entered the Farstrider Academy and started drifting apart from her. Her teachers had reinforced the feud between the Farstriders and the blood knights and she stopped wanting to see him. Finally, about a month after she had begun her training, she told him that she didn't want to see him any more.<br/><br/>Leon left her that day and went looking for a fight to ease the pain he felt. He found many fights over the years and it wasn't until one fight laid him up and left him with a slight limp that he was forced to examine his life. Disgusted with who he was becoming, he found his way to a travelling circus. They were in need of a ring master and he signed up on the spot. Life with the circus was what he needed and he was able to heal from the emotional scars he had caused himself over the years. <br/><br/>Months after joining the circus, Leon was enjoying a quiet night at home when Rhannah burst in the door and ran into his arms crying. He held her until she had calmed enough to tell him what had upset her. She gave him the story and once she had gone to bed, he left to track down the man that had hurt his sister. He started the search by looking for the man's brother, one of the men he knew from the circus. <br/><br/>As he expected, Haloril was trying to chat up a pretty girl at the Darkmoon Faire. What he didn't expect was that the woman wasn't just pretty, she was beautiful and she would capture his heart the second he saw her.<br/><br/>That night, he had returned to his home and placed the picture of Narella that he kept by his bed, in a drawer. His dreams no longer contained images of the one who got away. That night, for the first time, a beauty with long red hair that fell freely about her shoulders replaced images of a huntress with long red hair pulled back in a ponytail.<br/><br/>As he landed in New Kargath, Leon smiled. He had loved Narella at the time, but he saw, seven years later, that it was a childish love, a love that would never have lasted. What he felt for Jen'Tira was different, as different as night is from day.<br/><br/>He entered the inn and made his way to where she had been resting. There, in front of everyone around them, he knelt down and asked her the most important question of his life.<br/><br/>(2/2)

<span class="underline"><strong>A Dance of Fire:</strong></span><br/><br/>Flames leap and dance, the evenings temperature rising with it. Ribbons of light in the darkness move as one with their mistress. Entwining with her body, and lashing out in controlled fashion. Gold and red sparks hang in the night air. Shadows dance along with the light lending a quality of mystery to the performance.<br/><br/>The dancer glistens with a sheen of sweat and as the performance draws to an end she gives the flaming ribbons a new form…they dissolve into butterflies and fly away into the night.<br/><br/>((http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7TCp9cfByc))<br/><br/>Panting the dancer drops to the grass muttering. “Need…bigger butterflies….or perhaps birds.”<br/><br/>The emotions that stir passion, is how she forms and controls her flame. Exhausted Minaethiel Cinderward stretches out in the grass. <br/><br/><em>The lack of coin in my purse and my…falling out with the mages I once trained held in such high regard, have led me to this point. I cannot peddle my skills without the help of others. My new friends are right. I should join this Circus, aptly named the Cirque. The cards favour that choice….if they’ll have me. The cards also alluded that I may have to change my ways…</em><br/><br/>A soft snore can be heard for a nearby tent, interrupting the woman’s thoughts. Mina grins salaciously and rolls over in the grass, green eyes focused on the tent. <br/><br/><em>Perhaps not all of my ways…</em><br/><br/>Pulling her self to her feet the mage quietly approaches the tent; she pulls back the opening and peeks inside. Idly wondering if Kass had the same luck she did this night…and with whom it may have been Riavis or Illis? <br/><br/>Mina’s ‘luck’ had a name she wouldn’t remember, and would be kicked out her bed at sunrise. Also at sunrise the mage would find the Troll Riavis spoke of. He said the Cirque held auditions in Thunderbluff…if so she would find them there. <br/><br/>The woman grinned and slid into bed next to ‘Lucky’…

Some new posts here if anyone cares to keep up on the CC forums.<br/><br/><a href="../9882178734/index-page=1.html" class="bml-link-public">http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/9882178734?page=1</a><br/><br/>Also, there is a song floating in my head I heard a young elf singing. I think his name is Riavis. I was told he is banned from Thunderbluff. Too bad, we might have used him. Of course we welcome guests in the Cirque. We are not prejudiced.<br/><br/>-------------------------------<br/><br/>Taking out his accoustic guitar, Rivi, as he liked to be called, strummed it softly as he contemplated his recent discovery. No it was not the fact that undead liked his wildly shredding guitar music, it was the glance of a shy maiden. <br/><br/>A melody tickled his mind as he picked it out on the guitar, words came to him slowly as he rebuilt the scene in his mind.<br/><br/>----------------<br/><br/>Unspoken<br/><br/>It was only a passing glance<br/>It was only the ghost of a smile.<br/><br/>It was only an unspoken wish,<br/>It was only an unheard sigh.<br/><br/>It sent the mind to dreaming, <br/>It send the heart 'to a spin.<br/><br/>It made a hand pluck a flower,<br/>It stopped the world with a wish.<br/><br/>It wanted to offer the bloom,<br/>It wanted to savor the fragrance.<br/><br/>It missed the chance for a comment, <br/>It lost the sight of the goal.<br/><br/>It is lost in the memory of 'what if's'<br/>It is saddened for no reason why.<br/><br/>It was only a passing glance,<br/>It was only the ghost of a smile...<br/><br/>((this fits well with the lyrics- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UogNgeSlJ-A )

Illisidel Lightsun sat at the piano in his home, in Silvermoon, the events of that night had excited him, the thought of joining a circus where he could perform his music for an appreciative audience. He was giddy with excitement, and inspiration, and though he was happy, the song he played was slow, and melodic.<br/><br/>((http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ynTwH0rrl4))<br/><br/>He played with his heart singing with joy, and by the time he finished he had begun to sweat a bit. He smiled as he wiped his head with a nerby towel, yes if he could play like this, there was no way they would turn him away. Though he also had to remember Mina, they had decided to perform together, who would have though a chance meeting could change his life. He smiled as he picked up his journal, and his pen, and began writing.<br/><br/><em> Tonight was amazing, I have never before been given the chance to play my music for an audience, and even though it was only an audience of three it was still enjoyable. I had gone to the pond outside the city to perform my evening prayers, fate seemed to have other plans, as there was a small group of people already there. They were talking loud enough for me overhear, and the man that was there, was playing a guitar, deciding my prayers could wait, I brought out my flute, and began playing.<br/><br/>This attracted their attention, and they invited me over, at first their constant flirting had me wishing I had stayed away, but as the night went on, I found that these people shared my love of music in their own ways. Riavis, or Rivi as he prefers to be called was a musician like myself, the mage, Mina, was a lovely dancer, full of beauty, and grace, finally the huntress, Kass, had the most lovely voice, a voice that some might say came from a heavenly realm. We spent most of the night playing, singing, and dancing, and though I never thought myself anything special, Rivi suggested myself, Mina, and Kass audition for a circus. I had heard of this circus through whispers, I believe it is called Cirque, Mina seemed to jump at the idea, and I must say I find it intriguing as well. Perhaps if she is still up for it Mina, and I can perform together, me on my instruments, playing while she dances, I hope Kass decide to join us as well. Together I believe we could steal the show, I plan to go Thunder Bluff tomorrow, to audition, and I hope to run into Mina, and Kass while there, I think our act could be incredible, but time will tell.</em>

It was a rumor she heard from a friend still in Silvermoon. There was a surge of interest in Cirque. Some fine talent was on its way to audition. Something about a singer, a dancer and some musicians. Vivi paced the tent in front of Zael. "I want to know if it is true, can we get a show together for the next Darkmoon Faire? Seek these people out, Zael. I had hoped to have some clowns ready for an opening act, Cyaer is ill at the moment...I know Leon is ready to announce the acts and maybe...he can be a good straightman for a clown act with Cyaer."<br/><br/>Zael sat on the floor and watched Vivi pace back and forth. "I hear da same rumor. I tink it be dat same guitar playa dat stampede da kodo wit' his screamin' guitar. But maybe not...he be runnin' pretty fast wit' all dem Tauren chasin' him. Ya want me ta go ta Silvermoon and see if it be true?" <br/><br/>Vivi shook her head, "No, I think they are headed here. But if that guitar player is one of them he may need to sneak in...maybe it has been long enough the herder has forgotten. As long as the guitar music he uses is not that raucous noise, he should be ok. We will hold the audition here on the Bluffs, away from the herds anyway. The central bonfire area is a good place or maybe the Spirit Rise right here? There is a small open area here, yes...this should work." she smiled as she envisioned the area as a stage.<br/><br/>Zael walked beside Vivi and chuckled, "It be good, we kin see if dey like da performance from da beginnin'. At least we have a built in audience." she nodded at the workers around the small clearing.

Kreindis had been searching nearly nonstop for Zyss. He had sent her a letter telling her to stay put till he could find her, but he has had no luck. He sighs. His past was getting to him even more, whispering to him that she had left him, gone forever, but he refused to listen.<br/><br/>Every time, he would say to himself: "No, she's different... not like -her-." And every time, he would become less sure. He decided to send her another letter. Maybe she didn't get the other one. He takes out a quill and parchment and begins to write.<br/><br/>Zyss,<br/><br/>I miss you so much. Please let me know you receive this, and please stay put. Tell me where you are so that we can finally be together again. The past two months have been so lonely without you, and I have been so worried that you... found someone else. <br/><br/>Zyss, love, when you get this, contact me whenever you can...<br/><br/>Sincerely, Kreindis

From the pages of my journal:<br/><br/>They skitter through my thoughts and memories, glances and moments of a time with the one who thrills my heart like no other. Kel'tira...<br/><br/>The quiet look of pride, the gentle sweep of her brow as she listens to me, the tender touch of her lips upon mine sparking romance and love within me a fresh, and the soft touch of her fingers across my arm as she holds me in her arms.<br/><br/>The looks she gives me that entice me, thrill me, warn me, warm me, hold me, and calm me. Her eyes speak to me with a glance, a glare, a raised eyebrow, a fixed stare, to closed, cold, uncaring to concerned, worried, loving to seductive, and fetching.<br/><br/>I have felt her loving touch upon my soul, keeping me and sustaining me when I was lost and falling. Her breath has filled my nostrils with life and with the fragrance of peppermint. I have felt it hot upon my neck while it stirred me to untold reaches of passion and desire. And yes, I have felt it softly snore across my chest as she slept resting in my arms.<br/><br/>Each day is a new day with Kel'tira, nor would I have it any other way. I know that my love grows with each new day. For she inspire me to love her and care for her more each day. She is the heartbeat within my chest, she is the breath that I breathe, and the life that flows through my veins. She is all I will ever need...or want.<br/><br/>Kel'tira...&lt;thump, thump>...Kel'tira...&lt;thump, thump>...Kel'tira...
