The big Tauren sang in a very quiet and low tone. The drums were tribal drums used in clan assemblies such as births, festivals, and...funerals.<br/><br/>The large pile of rocks were all that designated the final resting place of the high-spirited monk known as Tazvor. His confidence was large, and he tried to do the impossible...and failed. Only his friend Jakota had been there.<br/><br/>Jak had rushed down to aid his friend, and he cast spell after spell trying to bring Taz back, but his spirit had moved on. And so Jak did the only thing left to do, he buried his friend, and sang him onward to the golden plains of the afterlife.

The tall tauren walked slowly through the trails and rises of Thunder Bluffs. He's mind troubled, and not watching where he was walking, he stumbled into a rather ponderous Pandarian meditating on the backside of one of the rather large teepees that the taurens used for services and abodes.<br/><br/>"I am so sorry," Jak quickly responded, waking from his thoughts, "I did not see you there."<br/><br/>"Ho ho, I find that rather difficult to believe as I am not so tiny that I could not be seen." the jovial panda replied.<br/><br/>Jakota stuttered, 'N...No, it's not that, I was so deep in thought, I didn't see you is what I meant to say. I apologize for walking all over you. Are you hurt?"<br/><br/>As the Pandarian stood he looked the tauren in the eyes, "Fear not, noble tauren, I am fine, no harm done." The panda bowed to the tauren, "I am Yinhon, a mistweaver from the traveling isle. I was merely meditating on the beauty and gentle spirits of your people. I find your way of life very simple and enjoyable. In some ways it reminds me of my home."<br/><br/>Jakota smiled as he saw the pandaman was nearly his own height, and bowed to the black and white bear, "I am Jakota, a druid of the people. Thank you for your kind words, Yinhon. I would like to sit and discuss with you our diffences and how your society works. If you have the time?"<br/><br/>The mistweaver nodded affirmative, "I would like that very much, Jakota. It is through the eyes of the individual that I truly learn the heart of the people I am studying. And you may call me Yin, if you like. The panda plopped down on the ground, eager to speak with his newfound teacher."<br/><br/>"Call me Jak, Yin, everybody does." as he sat down on the grass across from the rotund panda. 'Where shall I begin? Have you heard of the Earthmother?" <br/><br/>And so they spent many hours and days speaking, exchanging ideas, and cultures. Jakota's thoughts and feelings grew from the knowledge that Yin taught him. As did Yinhon's respect and admiration for the Taurens and their clans. They built up a very good rapport between themselves, and became fast friends.

It had taken the rogue a few days to finally locate his old friend. And to be honest, the last time he had talked with him had left a very sour taste in his mouth. Not Azmos, but himself. He had let his emotions ride rampant instead of staying cool and rational.<br/><br/>Cy could come up with alot of excuses and such but what it came down to was he felt betrayed and hadn't taken the time to hear Az out. He wanted to rectify that with the priest. As well as a few other things that concerned him.<br/><br/>He had finally caught up with Az in Pandaria of all places, and in a place he knew well, Halfhill. Cyaer had seen Azmos before Az saw Cy, as Az was busy quibbling over a few gold over seeds necessay for his garden. The rogue walked up behind his white-haired friend and began joining in the discussion of the price. Cy took the side of the vendor, and when Azmos turned to tell the intruder to take a hike, he stopped and stared at his longtime friend.<br/><br/>Cy grinned, "How are you, old friend?" He saw a range of emotions flicker through the priest's eyes, and across his face. And Cyaer wasn't quite sure how Az would finally react. Would he be willing to sit and talk over some hot tea, or would he simply walk away. Not that Cy would blame him if he did so.<br/><br/>Azmos turned to the vendor and paid him the amount the vendor was willing to accept, and stooped to pick up the bags of seed. Then paused.<br/><br/>He stood and spun around, and grabbed the surprised thief in a massive bear hug. He held his friend close, and whispered into Cy's ear, "I'm sorry, and I forgive you" several times. When he finally let go of Cy, his face was wet with tears, and he wore a bright smile.<br/><br/>"By the Light, it's damn good to see you again, Cy! Let me look at you. Are you feeling alright? Stick out your tongue and let me check." His tone was jovial and pleasant.<br/><br/>Cyaer had been shocked, stunned even, he had never seen such a display by this man who stood before him. And when Az told him to stick out his tongue, he did it without even thinking. And the tall sindorei cleric roared in laughter. Azmos cried out, "I cannot believe you just did that!"

Strolling along the peaceful paths of the Thunderbluff settlement, Dusk looked around with interest. She had not spent much time with the Tauren, but she admired them greatly. Warriors and paladins, druids and others she had come to know were greatly desired to have on your side in a battle.<br/><br/>But she was not here to do battle, but searching for a friend. Someone who had offered her friendship even as the others seemed put off by her blue eyes and the cursed sword. The curse was gone. The sword was now just as inert as it was coming off the blacksmith's anvil. <br/><br/>Her body and mind were healed pretty much, but she was still not completely whole. It would take a very powerful healer and maybe even a paladin working together to restore the damage. If nothing else, the residual effects meant she was immune to disease. She was sterile, no children would ever grow in her womb. <br/><br/>Most of the faces she saw were Tauren, no sign of the death knight she had befriended. Sighing in frustration she turned only to run smack into a troll. "OH! Pardon me, I am so clumsy! I have yet to fully recover all my agility and strength."<br/><br/>The troll merely laughed and brushed off her tabard, a rather colorful turquoise and white with a clown's hat on the front. "Dat be all right! Ya did not hurt dis ol' troll. What the matter be? I kin sense someting wrong...ya not be undead...but someting about ya..." her golden eyes traveled the length of the blood elf with nature's insight.<br/><br/>Dusk blushed and stammered, "I...I was c-cursed...I had a sword that was...trying to k-kill me. But its gone now! The spirit that is..and the curse! I am looking for a Tauren...he goes by the name of Ox. He is a death knight. I don't know if he would be here or not...he is a friend.." she trailed off lamely. <br/><br/>The troll raised her brow and tilted her head, "Ya be friends with a death knight? Dat be risky...but sometimes, da Tauren are not so bad...dey come back...some don't..but I do know a nice tauren ya might like! He be a druid like me. I be Zael Tek'rin. Maybe Jakota, he know dis Ox. Let's see if we kin find him." <br/><br/>The blood elf swallowed her pride and nodded, "I am Dusk Witherblade. Just call me Dusk. I have a very important journey to take on, and I need a friend to help me along the way."

After the shock, and joke played on him, Cyaer began to chuckle. "What has gotten into you, Az? I remember you being so stoic, and now look at you - smiling, laughing out loud, and bear hugs. It's so good to see you like this! Tell me over a cup or maybe a pot of tea?"<br/><br/>The priest nodded, and went to reach for the sacks of seed, when Cy knelt down beside him and offered to help him. Az nodded and they took the seeds to a very humble little farm. There wasn't much to it really, a lot of weeds, but there was a small garden, and Cy could see a future here if Az put his mind to it. The small shack was cozy, and Cy smiled, he had started out this way too, but with the friends he had made with the Tillers, Sunsong was running well now.<br/><br/>Az put a kettle on to boil, and brought out two large cups, more like mugs really. They sat on the floor, and Az looked at his friend across the table. "So what really brings you here, Cy. We did not end well oh those many months ago, not that I am not glad to see you, but you would not be here unless you had something on your mind."<br/><br/>"That's the Azmos I remember, straight to the point and direct. I always appreciated that about you. Well, partly to clear up the way we ended. I did not give you time or a chance to explain yourself for leaving the Fellowship. I would hear your side of it, if you would, please."<br/><br/>The kettle began to whistle, and Az took the time to think about his answer, as he made the tea, As he set the cups before them, he began slowly...

<em>She sat in the elegant apartment of the mage. Actually, it was her new apartment now, the mage only resided there at Zyss' whim. What a funny turn of events it had been. But now that it seemed to be resolved currently, the warlock's thoughts turned to a certain handsome paladin who had stolen her heart.<br/><br/>She searched the drawers of the desk, and found several sheafs of paper. And then opened her ink pot, and set her pen to paper...</em><br/><br/>___________________________________________________________________________<br/>My dearest Kreindis,<br/><br/>It is my sincerest wish that this letter finds you safe and sound. I have regrets my dear sweet paladin. Regrets in not seeing you off properly to Pandoria, and sending you letters each day to keep our spirits and morale up while we were a part. Those are my only regrets, dear one.<br/><br/>Every moment that goes by I do not regret meeting you on that pier. I found a man I could believe in, to trust my heart with and long for the rest of my life. Krei, I know we both had moments that we felt insecurities and doubts...not anymore, beloved, not any more. I now know that your heart is true, and that you love me for who I am, and not what I am.<br/><br/>And you do not know how much that trust and love means to me personally. Or perhaps you do. I do not know, I only know that I need you Kreindis. I need you in my life, I want you in my life, and I'll do whatever it takes to have you keep loving me. I find I derive strength from your love while you are away. I still wear your shirt to remember your scent, and my dreams revolve around you, my Kreindis, and no other.<br/><br/>I have so much to tell you, and to explain to you, my love. I am no longer with the fellowship. I know this was important to you, and I was proud to wear its colors...however I learned a few things, and I do not feel that the direction the fellowship is headed is in agreement with where I personally am headed. I will explain more in detail when we can sit alone and talk. I hope this does not tear us a part, as I think I would surely die if such was the case.<br/><br/>One final thing, before I close - I love you, Kreindis. Do not ever forget or doubt my love for you. It is as strong for you as I when I came to the realization of just how wonderful you are, how gentle, and how you care for me. I love you, and it is a real love, not some passing flirtation, not some infatuation, but a real and true love. One that can withstand the tides of time, if we but hold on to one another throughout that time.<br/><br/> I love you,<br/><br/>Zyss<br/>_________________________________________________________________________<br/><br/><em>The lady reached for an envelope, and addressed it to her love. She lightly sprayed her perfume on the letter, and tucked it into the envelope. She set her pen down, closed the ink pot, and put them into the desk. Then took the letter to the nearest mailbox, hoping it would reach him safely.</em>

The great cat hunted the plains around Thunder Bluff, enjoying the simple time of being at home. He spied a swift gazelle, and slunk down deep in the shallow grasses, his form only a few feet away from his prize. He could smell the warm musk of the gentle creature, and was just about to pounce when he detected something else in her musk. It was a she, and she was preparing to drop her young here and now.<br/><br/>Quietly, Jakota changed to his true form, kneeling in the grass. He softly crooned and sang to the nervous mother as she strained to give birth. And the druid could see she was straining too hard, there may be trouble with the birth, and he laid his hand upon the gazelle, lightly stroking its coat, and he saw that the calf was breeched.<br/><br/>She was weak, and he fortified her with a simple spell, as he stood behind the mother, gently turning the tired calf within to come into this world the proper way. He patted the mother-to-be, and softly talked her through the birth. The new buck was alert, and must have received some of the fortification from the spell, for he stood shakily up, and attempted to move. <br/><br/>So intent was Jakota in the newborn's first steps, he didn't sense the presence of the shadow cat as it sprung forward to take the mother gazelle down. For a brief moment, the druid was tempted to blast the cat, but as she dragged off the carcass, he saw the swollen teats, and knew there were kittens to be fed. He was not one to mess with the circle of life here on the plains. It was an age old story, that continued from generation to generation, and he slowly bowed to the cat, and the gazelle.<br/><br/>He turned when he heard the soft bleat of the newborn buck. It would be defenseless, and starve out here without its mother. And yet the circle almost required it. It was how it went. And Jakota moved to pick the calf up within his arms, the circle be damned, he had helped it along to be birthed, he would not relinguish that responsibility now.<br/><br/>So he carried the buck quickly to the Rise of the Elders, seeking the proper tools to feed and nourish the fawn. Jak took it to his home there on the Bluff. He could see the small gazelle was already imprinting itself on the druid, and he smiled. This was going to be a lifelong study in the life and caring of a gazelle. <br/><br/>He looked up from bottle feeding the fawn, as two shadows crossed his threshold. He recognized one, the other was a stranger.<br/><br/>"How may I help you, Zael?" His voice was deep and warm as he spoke.

The gentle breezes atop Thunderbluff teased at Vira's hair. It was piled atop her head in a regal style. She strolled among the tents with a confident stride. She had friends here and her gathering of misfits and performers.<br/><br/>She spied Zael speaking with a Sindorei who seemed troubled. Vira watched them walk away with a curious feeling. Would they soon have more members? They needed to replace the acrobat. She felt a twinge of sadness that no one ever really got a chance to know him. He seemed a likeable fellow.<br/><br/>She ordered the high wire dismantled. Speaking to the workers, she told them not to make more of these contraptions unless she approved of them. There were to be safety devices in place. Nothing would disturb customers more than to see someone die. "We need more clowns, more singers and more music. We need fun and distracting entertainment."<br/><br/>She was through with her inspection and went back to her office tent on the Spirit Rise. The tent was quiet. Perhaps she should hire a secretary or at least a clerk to help her with the books. Sitting in the comfortable cushion she had brought from Silvermoon she looked through the applications with interest.

The elf stood back in politeness as Zael strode into the tent. The troll did not waste time and chuckled at the huge Tauren. "What ya be doing dere, Jakota? Dat fawn be a nice tasty treat fer a kitty..." her eyes dancing in amusement. She loved to tease the big Tauren, if only to hear his deep chested rumble of laughter.<br/><br/>"I bring dis elfie in ta meetya, she be lookin' fer another Tauren, but I don't know dis Ox. I be tinkin' ya know so many, maybe ya heard of him? Ah she be Dusk Witherblade. I be tinkin' she have a story ta tell. Maybe in time, huh?" her warm chatter making the elf blush. <br/><br/>Dusk stepped forward and greeted the huge bull. "Just call me Dusk. I do have a tale. but it is a long and troubling story." she looked at the newborn fawn and the way he was holding it. She smiled at the apparent gentleness. He did not look like Ox in any way, but somehow she felt she could trust him.<br/><br/>"I was cursed, and had a malevolent spirit trying to turn me undead. Through much effort on the part of my employer, Lord Bloodmoon, I was released from the curse and my soul has been renewed. Not without cost. I have been told my eyes will not return to their original color...and I am barren. Good news is...I am immune to disease. Guess I am kind of a misfit." she chuckled nervously. She had no idea if this was a good course to follow. But she needed to do it.<br/><br/>Zael had stood back a bit and was studying the elf as she spoke. "Ya have the scent of undeath about ya, but ya have more of life than undeath. I see dat explains it. Dat sword on yer back, it looks like da design of da death knight runes on it. But dey be shut off. Ya should have a runemaster look at dem." her words caused Dusk to go pale.<br/><br/>"I-I...yes...it was a runed blade. It belonged to my husband...but he is dead. I have to learn to rune the blade and tie it to me. Without the stigma of the death knights. I just want to augment the frost and maybe the blood runes. The unholy ones I do not wish to use. It will be a long and costly journey, seeking runemasters. I seek knowledge and wisdom. Lord Bloodmoon has given me leave to seek this out somewhat. But I am still at his beck and call." her voice was not the hollow of a death knight, but it did have a strange chilling quality to it.

Jak looked up into Zael's face, seeking to see if what she had said was truth or not. He saw the sparkle of amusement in her eyes, and began to laugh, the deep chested rumble that she had hoped to hear.<br/><br/>He turned as Zael introduced the elf, there was something distinctive about her, he could almost smell it on her. Fortunately, the little buck had its fill of the rich milk Jakota had given it, and he laid down in the pile of assorted furs and skins, and fell fast asleep. Jakota stroked its soft fur before rising to stand before his guests.<br/><br/>As he stood, Jak was still chuckling when he stopped in midstance and quieted, the name "Ox" was known to him. His jaw set firmly, as he listened to the elf speak, wondering why she sought the dead one called Terminox. He seemed to tense up at Ox's name, but continued to listen.<br/><br/>His heart went out to this female before him, and though she made light of it, it disturbed the druid to hear she was barren. However, there were many burdens one must carry through life, this would be a terrible one to bear.<br/><br/>The tall bull listened and nodded at Zael's asessment of the elf, indeed there was the taint of undeath upon her, but not so as to be distracting or foul smelling. Perhaps it was because he was a healer, and one with the Earthmother, but he was not put off by her at all.<br/><br/>As the two before him quieted, he spoke with a deep voice, and to the one called Dusk. "Aye, I do know of the one called Ox. It is not his full moniker he goes by...he is the Terminox, a weapon of mass destruction and death created by Arthus." <br/><br/>Jak continued, there was a warmth to his voice as he remembered, "He was a good brave before...his death. He was a warrior of great skill, and protected the people well. He died serving our old leader."<br/><br/>His tone became icy, and cold, "He was dead, and when the Scourge selected him for their use, they desecrated his remains turning him into the thing he is now. He does not come back here, the pain of who he was takes its toll on him when he is here."<br/><br/>Jakota closed his eyes, the words seemed hard for him to say, and sorrow could be sensed in the big Tauren's tone. "He was...my sister's husband. She tried to talk to him, to see if he was who he had been...she died last spring still loving the man he had been and not the monster he had become."<br/><br/>He opened his eyes, and gazed at the one called Dusk. "I know not where "Ox" is. The last I had heard was from a brave stationed on the other side of the portal about a few weeks ago. He...he was working out of the Hellfire area. He may have moved on since then. I would start in Thallmar, they may know of his whereabouts."

Hanging her head as he spoke, Dusk knew the druid spoke true. He knew of the bull she spoke of and the distaste she heard coming from Jakota made her sad. "Thank you, I know it is hard for those left behind to accept what has happened to their loved one." her voice took on a strained note. It was from personal experience that the feelings of dread and fear associated with a death knight had their roots.<br/><br/>She turned to Zael and murmered softly. "Thank you for your help. I will search for him in Outland." her words carried a determination. Sighing once she turned back to Jakota. "I do not think he is the monster most death knights are. It might seem strange, but I have developed a friendship with him. It was not easy to warm up to a death knight, but he offered help when I least expected it. I do not think he avoids this place out of shame, more that he does not want to cause any more pain to those who remember him for what he was before. He still is a mighty warrior, he just has a few added perks. And the stigma of being undead." the voice of the elf was full of sadness and compassion for the death knight.<br/><br/>Shrugging with a slight smile she turned to leave. "Perhaps I can visit again when you are planning a performance. I always thought of the circus as something fun to watch. My duties to Lord Bloodmoon give me few opportunities to pursue entertainment. I might even entice them to come and watch some time."<br/><br/>Smiling and bowing to both Jakota and Zael, Dusk made her way to the flight master. It was a long trip to Outland. And she did not have time to waste. Wishing she had an opportunity to speak with the dwarven runemasters. Undoubtably they would have more insight on the runes she would need.

The sunrise touched the edge of the valley the dark tauren found himself in. It had been a long night, and as the new day shone over the land below the scene of a battle was evident. Bodies lay stewn about as though a tornado had swept over the remains.<br/><br/>Ox looked up and noted the circling buzzards. Soon the other scavengers would arrive and the feast of the dead would be in full swing. As he turned his attention to the battlesite, he saw the wolves begin to descend into the valley. The death knight thought that the word spreads fast when it comes to a free dinner. <br/><br/>He stood from the rise he had been sitting on, placing the long katana back into its scabbard. He slowly walked down to the floor of the valley, and then called for his courser. He wasn't in the mood to watch the carnage of what these scavengers would do to these combatants. He had caused the deaths of over a dozen men, that was enough for him.<br/><br/>Ox had walked the floor the night before, picking up any trophies to be had, and any coin that might be available. Some might consider that ghoulish. He didn't care, the dead had no use for it, and he did.<br/><br/>He mounted his dark horse, and rode off, seeking to aid instead of conquer. His thoughts went to Zangarmarsh, and he rode long and hard. It was good to have a tireless mount to take him wherever he needed to go. He hunkered down and galloped towards a new destination, just one more place, another town...never staying long, ever moving on to...something.

Nightfall at Sunsong, the gentle changing of the guard from daylight to dusk to night. A lone figure rests on the porch of his little home away from home. Cy scans the small garden he has cared for a long time, the cabbage and melons ready for those he has promised the best he had to offer. The weeds were mostly gone, and he watched the grass outside his little shed turn from green to yellow, to gold, to purple...as night approached.<br/><br/>His mind was a swirl, for he had left the one place he felt he had family, well at one time he had. He remembered the friends he had made, and those who had left before him. The rogue had hung on as long as he could, however change was on the wind, and the family he had loved was not the same.<br/><br/>Change is inevitable, one only has to watch the seasons to know that. And so he had left, his heart changed by the changes within the Fellowship. He did not harbor any regrets, and he left as quietly as he had come into the guild, without fanfare.<br/><br/>Cyaer had listened to his old friend, and slowly came to the same conclusion Azmos had. This wasn't the same guild he had joined, and maybe that was a good thing. Light he hoped it was. There were rumors of war, just like there always were, and the Fellowship was only preparing for wars. He was not interested in war and never really had been.<br/><br/>His future was in the family he had, the children that Kel'tira and he would have, and most of all in the love he shared with his wife. His home was with her, and wherever she stood. While he was not sure of involving the House in this upcoming upheaval, he stood beside her, confident in her decisions. He would always be there...always,<br/><br/>He stood, and sighed heavily. He whispered good night to the day, and a sad good-bye to his home for so long, The Rising Sun Fellowship.

Azmos awoke early in the morning, and turned to kiss the cheek of the one who held his heart. Hahnai was beautiful in her rest, the lines of doubt, and concerns sometimes wore heavy in her eyes and brow, however, those lines and furrows were gone as she slept peacefully.<br/><br/>The priest gazed upon her, enjoying this brief moment of the day, adoring her face, and calm. Az lay beside her, his arm beneath her head, while she breathed in slowly and surely. He leaned forward to gently kiss the tip of her nose, and watched as her face scrunched up, her rest disturbed by some preceived pest. He chuckled lightly, as he moved ever so slowly so as not to awaken her. <br/><br/>A soft moan escaped her lips as she pulled closer to him, seeking his warmth, and the comfort and security she derived from being held by him. And embrace Hahnai he did. His strong arms pulled her close, her face resting against his very hairy chest. And a sigh of contentment arose from her as her own arms wrapped themselves around him, and she snuggled into him. <br/><br/>Azmos smiled and sighed, resigning himself to fulfilling her need for him. His schedule was not so full that he could not spend an extra hour in bed with this lovely creature. His lips found her forehead and he kissed her lightly. <br/><br/>He needed her just as much as she needed him. Az found she completed him so many ways he had never thought possible. And the love and warmth he saw in her eyes drew him to her just as the moon draws the tides. There was an attraction, a pull that kept them together, and he found himself falling deeper and deeper in love with her.<br/><br/>Az placed his other arm around her, and slowly went to sleep in the most comfortable embrace of the lady who loved him. A sigh escaped his lips as he slept soundly beside her.

A page from my journal - the Blasted Lands<br/><br/>I have been out here far too long, and away from the one I find in my thoughts and dreams constantly. Was I too quick in giving him my love too soon? What he must think of me now.<br/><br/>I have lost touch with the Fellowship, and turned in my guildstone to someone, maybe a worker, in New Dawn. I rode away feeling empty inside. How could I feel a part of something I was too far and long away from anyway? I made a few friends, that's true, now I may never see them again.<br/><br/>Perhaps I am meant to be alone. Out on the road, doing a little good here and there, not really building ties that will bind me to one place, to one someone....<br/><br/><em>The rest of the page is illegible, the ink running and spoiling the page... as though tears may have fallen on the words...only one word can really be made out anywhere on this tear and inkstained page.

My heart skips a beat as I hear the news from my sister. Jen'Tira, my beautiful Jen'Tira, left the fellowship and is alone in the world.<br/><br/>I must find her! I ache to see her and feel her body close to mine. It's been too long since I last saw her smile, felt her sweet lips on mine or even just held her close, our hearts beating as one.<br/><br/>Too long have I wandered the paths of Azeroth alone. I must find her and tell her once more of my love for her. If she will let me, I want to make her mine. I will ask her to walk life's paths with me, to stay with me always. <br/><br/>Stay strong my darling, I'm coming to find you and make you my wife.

The full moon shown over the huge valley of Mulgore. Vivi moved like a ghost along the pathways of the Bluff. The Tauren had welcomed her here and seemed content for her to set up an area below the bluff for practice performances. <br/><br/>Vivi wanted to have a public performance soon. But she wanted to see all they had ready first. She wanted a grand entrance, a lot of dancing and singing and some fireworks to start and end the show. Maybe a parade could start things off? Everyone in full costume and on their mounts.<br/><br/>Gini seemed excited about something, she was making a special shirt for a brave she had met this day. She decorated it with beads and feathers. It was a true warrior shirt. Viv had not seen her this excited since she came to the Spirit Rise asking for a job.<br/><br/>The time was almost ready to have a wedding. Fae was getting restless and Vivi was running out of errands to send Neryth on to keep them from spending too much time together. She was young once and she knew how much they wanted to spend the night together. <br/><br/>Vivi wanted to make sure they were right for each other and not just a hormonal thing. She was going to ask Fae when they intended on setting the ceremony up. Fae had mentioned something about WinterVeil coming soon. Tapping her chin with a long manicured finger, she nodded. A Winterveil wedding would be fun.

<em>The sun bears down on a single female figure as she rides across the dust and sand of the hell hole known as the Blasted Lands. Small lizards and long thin snakes skitter and slither for what shade can be found, as she passed by. <br/><br/>The plate armor she wears weighs heavy upon her shoulders, and seems to hold the heat of the sun. She moans slightly as she sits upright upon her charger, then slides down from the saddle to walk beside the spirited courser. <br/><br/>Grim thoughts pass through her tired mind, and her cracked and parched lips whisper a soft prayer of hope and possible guidance for her in the future. She gently pats the horse who has been more than a mount, but a friend who has been with her through thick and thin. She looks up into the distant mountains, together through heat, to freezing cold.<br/><br/>As she looked up towards the mountains, she noted a few rooftops, and a thin line of smoke rising up into the blue cloudless sky. Her feet quickened, as she began to jog towards whatever kind of established town, village, or tradepost might be ahead. She found a beaten path that lead to whatever place was there. <br/><br/>She stopped short a moment, pondering whether it might be a Horde base. But her intuition said no, she had encountered nothing that would point to that, nor had she run into any opposition on the way here. She remounted and rode slowly into the spread out town of a goblin trading post.<br/><br/>Jen'tira found a stable for her mount, telling them to water him well, and rub him down, as she flipped both the stablemen a gold coin. She moved to the inn, dreaming of a nice mug of ale or a simple beer. She noted the mailbox, and hesitated. She had not received mail for quite some time, a lump came to her throat, thinking of this long stretch of lonliness she had gone through. She closed her eyes, sighed and resigned herself for disappointment.<br/><br/>The small envelope was dusty, and the edges frayed, but there it sat in the box. She withdrew it, and when she saw the handwriting on the front, her spirit soared, for she recognized it immediately. Her thumb broke the wax seal and her hands unfolded the letter within. And her eyes poured over the words written there by the one person she had waited and longed to hear from the most, Leon.<br/><br/>Tears welled in her eyes, and a smile came to her cracked lips. She strode into the inn and ordered a tall mug of their best mead, ale, beer, whatever...he had heard her, felt her, something, and she was happy to have just gotten this small note from Leon.<br/><br/>She set her pack down and rummaged through it finding the implements she needed to send her reply. She couldn't wait, she needed to write him back to let him know where she stood and how she felt. <br/><br/>Light, what a blessing that one single letter had been to her.</em>

Her warm brown eyes haunted him, as did the quiet calm of her mellow voice. He had only met her once, but she had left a big impression on the druid's heart and conscious mind. Even now, as he set upon the bluff's edge, warming in the sun, and enjoying the gentle breeze that carried the scent of wildflowers, he found his thoughts turning back to her.<br/><br/>Jakota was a young bull, inexperienced in the ways and world of the heart. He did not need such distractions as the lovely Ginik. He had pledged himself to the Earthmother, and doing her work on Azeroth. And somehow he had always thought that he was meant to do it alone, like many a druid hermit, finding his corner of the world to protect and defend the land, the flora and fauna. Wasn't that the plan for his life? <br/><br/>The young gazelle calf bleated, seeking the nourishment he craved and hungered for, as well as needed. As Jakota prepared a bottle for the youngster, adding more nutrients and solids to the formula, he thought of the little fellow's chances. He knew he had a long road to hoe to teach and allow the little one to grow stronger, and become the fleet footed master of the plains.<br/><br/>He remember the fragrance of the herbs she had put in the tea she offered him. The sweet mixture had left a good taste in his mouth and on his tongue. Come to think about it, it helped calm his nerves too, though why he was nervous, he couldn't say.<br/><br/>He absently wondered how good a cook Ginik might be if she made tea that tasted so good. He shook his great maned head, wondering why she came back to his thoughts so easily. Was it that smile that seemed to warm his soul? Or how her skin and fur seemed to compliment her eyes? Or maybe...stop it...stop pining for one you barely even know. <br/><br/>Perhaps a journey, a long journey to find the ever elusive herbs he needed for his potions and concotions was in order. Something to take him away to think about what she might mean to him. Jak shook his head, she probably doesn't even remember me any more, just another brave of the clan is all. <br/><br/>So why did that thought trouble him, and cause an ache in his heart?
