A journal entry - Hellfire Peninsula<br/><br/>So this is Outland, what a fascinating place. When I stepped through the portal it was the enormous sky that caught my eye. Everything looked so very close, I felt I could reach out and touch it. It was amazing, and so unique. I look forward to whatever it has to offer.<br/><br/>I must say the war here seems so different than what is happening at home. Though I admit the whole place seems to want to take a bite out of you. These so called Hellboars are a strange breed if ever there was one. And mutated orcs that explode? Light, take me home!<br/><br/>And demons. A wide variety of demons. Imps, stone monstrosities, and tall one with big breasts and hard hitting thugs. I think I am going to like it here. My only regret, Leon isn't here at my side. What a refreshing way to start out day, slaying demons before breakfast, and defeating orcs before lunch. Orcs. Aren't they our allies? War is as confusing as hell.<br/><br/>Tonight I sleep in a hammock alone, instead of a comfy bed, with the possibility of Leon with me. I wonder why I fight out here, hacking and slashing, when I could be resting in his arms? Light, we have a wedding to plan! Am I running away from all that? I just want to marry him, and start having babies. <br/><br/>Babies? Did I just write babies? Have I been so taken as to become a wife and a mother? I love Leon. I ache for him even now, but my thoughts turning to sniveling snot nosed brats? That's not me. I am a warrior, not a wet nurse. Oh, Light, what a baby will do to my body! I'll be bloated, out of shape!<br/><br/>Whoa, whoa, whoa! Rein it in, Jen! One day at a time. Light, girl, you are anxious and frightened all at once. You need to see him again. Let him hold you close, and tell you he loves you. That will make Azeroth all good and fine again. I need a good healthy dose of that hunky handsome paladin to set me straight. Maybe even look into planning the wedding too.

I explore the lands of the Pandarens. I enjoy the uniqueness of the people and their society, and I enjoy the creatures I see and encounter. Though I admit I have a growing disregard for the Virmen. And yet, while I wander the roads of this island, I cannot help thinking of a pretty young priestess that I have grown to love so much.<br/><br/>I have seen some lovely places here, that I would like to walk beside her with her little hand in mine. And I have even grown used to the cuisine here. It excites my palate, and I would dearly love to share a meal with Hahnai in many of the inns and noodle shops that propagate the villages.<br/><br/>Most of all I miss her. Her sweet gentle voice, those lovely eyes, the light fragrance of her hair, and yes, I miss her lips upon my own. I feel the empty ache of not embracing her to me, and feel her form against my own. I can only pray that she is doing well, and that the Light, and even her Shadow protect her. <br/><br/>I have come to accept her use of the Shadow. One does what one can do to survive in the world. She is good, and I do not see her falling into darkness due to her use of the Shadow. I still pray she learns to grow closer to the Light, but I cannot live her life for her. She must walk her own path. I am grateful she wishes to walk that path with me.<br/><br/>I shall write Hahnai, to let her know she is in my thoughts, and heavy on my heart, but in a good way. I miss making sweet music with her. And singing along with her. I have heard a loremaster here that relays much of the history and stories of the land by singing them. It was not an experience I will soon forget.<br/><br/>Hani, wherever you might be, I am loving you and thinking of you fondly.

He strode through the shadows as though he felt at home within them. And arrived at the waiting circle well before he was expected. He slowly went over the "list" of things <strong>HE</strong> would expect answers...<br/><br/>The warlock was alive. Though there appeared to be some trace of the narcotic in her system still. Nothing to worry about. The antidote had worked, but barely. She was seeing a paladin, they seemed very close. And her lover left their abode. She has not been seen there for several days now.<br/><br/>The hunter had been easy enough to find and kill. He hadn't made any contact with the mistress of the circus, or any other members. He could very well never be missed. He smiled inspite of himself, one down...<br/><br/>The Tauren had been harder to take down. He fought well, and pulled no punches. But 1 vs 20? His death was assured as well. He had a lot of gold on him, which was split amongst the rest of the living. He had friends and contacts in the circus. Time will tell if he is noticed missing. That's two...<br/><br/>And lastly, the mage. I have searchers seeking her whereabouts. Who knows where she went with that blasted teleport spell they use? We will find her. She is not invisible. <br/><br/>"Well, minion, let's hear your report." The voice was deep, and cold like a stone.<br/><br/>"Yes, Master, concerning the one called Zyss..."

The long lonely wail echoed through the canyons, the sobs would not stop. Her face covered in tears as she smeared ashes into her skin. He was gone. Taken before anyone could help, taken before he could taste her sweet love. Her heart was shattered by the news. None could console her as she sat by the fire, refusing food and sobbing uncontrollably. <br/><br/>They came and offered her help, but words fell on deaf ears. She would not hear his deep rumbling laugh again. She wanted to hear nothing else. Arms reached for her to hold her as she wept, but she pushed them away. She wanted only one person to fold their arms around her. And he was gone.<br/><br/>The great mother sighed and sat down next to her granddaughter. "You will heal in time, grief has you in it's grip. But know we are all here to grieve with you. Jakota was known to all of us as a brave and true druid and friend. He will be sorely missed. There will be a hunt to find out who did this. They will pay....yes they will pay in blood for causing you such pain."

He lay on the floor beside his son and daughter, his deep chuckle filling the room, as he played with his children. It started by making farting sounds on their little bellies, and the peels of laughter Alyssara would make each time. Then it was Kier'ali's turn, and when he began laughing, Aly joined in. And daddy was having so much fun bonding with his little darlings.<br/><br/>Then of course, it was diaper changing time, and as he brought the fresh new diaper up, he hid behind it, then said a gentle "Boo!" to his precious little girl. Her eyes widened at first, then as Cy began to make faces at her, she began to giggle. He did this for a little bit before he turned to his son.<br/><br/>Kier kicked and fussed as his father changed him, and just as Cy bent down to make faces at the baby, he found his face wet from a steady stream of baby urine. Cy lay the new diaper over the baby, as he sputtered and started to laugh. "Kier? Is this how it's goning to be? You little imp!"<br/><br/>He redried and powdered the boy again, and came cautiously up to diaper Kier again. But baby Kier seemed to be empty now. After diapering the baby, he set him next to his daughter and played with them for awhile longer. Kier began nodding off, and Aly soon followed. And Cyaer looked down at his little angels.<br/><br/>He quietly and carefully picked them up and took them to their wee little beds. He kissed each one, and tucked them in under the blankets. Cy sighed as he looked at the twins in their beds, and he thought life didn't get much better than this. Except maybe...<br/><br/>Kel'tira lay asleep on their bed, and Cy gently removed her slippers, and softly tucked her into the covers. And he stepped out of the house, looking up at the myriad of stars overhead. He looked forward to the night he would be pointing out some of the brighter ones to little Aly and Kier. Yes, it was sometime in the future, and it was a future Cyear looked forward to spending time in.<br/><br/>The rogue moved quietly back into the house, securing it for the night, and returned to his bed. He lay beside Kel'tira, the woman of his dreams, and lightly kissed her forehead. He laid back, and looked up at the ceiling. And Kel rolled over and snuggled close to him. His arms wrapped around her as he sang the old children's song he had sung to the babies. <br/><br/>He smiled as he fell asleep next to his bride, content and happy.

"And the others?" the dark shadow of the Master intoned.<br/><br/>"The others, Master? You mean the band and the owner? I have heard very little. Would you have me investigate them as well?"<br/><br/>"Yes. I want you to find out about them all. Lady Blacktalon is not one to trifle with, so stay at a safe distance, however..." the voice grew ominous, "I want a report on all of them, the whole circus, is that understand?"<br/><br/>He fell to one knee before his master, a fist clenched over his heart, "I hear and obey, Master. Your will be done!"<br/><br/>"You will need gold to fund the people it will take to take on such a task, minion. Stop by the goblin, to pick up what you will need. And minion..."<br/><br/>"Yes, My Lord."<br/><br/>"I want a full report on all of them. Is that understood?"<br/><br/>He bowed his head before his master, "Yes, My Lord. I fully understand."<br/><br/>"Good. You may go. And do not disappoint me"<br/><br/>The dark shadow faded from the room, and he stood cautiously. He walked away slowly thinking of the resources he would need to tap, and the cost of such an endeavor. He knew only one thing was certain, he would not fail in this, for he already knew the consequences.

Journal entry~ (<em>The handwriting is weak and more of a scrawl than what the other entries show</em>)<br/><br/>I do not know how I did it. Perhaps the Light protects me more than I know, but there were six of them. And they had only murder in their hearts.<br/><br/>Two forsaken, a sindorei, and three goblins. They came looking for me, asking if I was from Cirque. Then they attacked. It took all I had to defeat them...<br/><br/>Hahnai! I need to warn her, I need to warn them all...<br/><br/>(<em>Several spots of blood are splattered on the page</em><em>.</em>)

The rogue moved through the shadows slowly and silently. And stopped when he found his target. He got down into a crouch, and surreptitiously watched as the dark clad man talked with the goblins and forsaken. He scanned the room, and his eyes grew wide, then narrowed as he recognized the faces of several of the Cirque pictured on the wall behind the man.<br/><br/>He noted Azmos and the pretty litle priestess Hahnai he was known to care a great deal for. There was Neryth, and his bride to be, Pfaedra. Fyn? Fynnariel, the hunter, he had only met her once, but she had made an impression on him. Several he had only heard of, but knew were in the circus. Leon and his fiance. Vivieka Blacktalon.<br/><br/>Then there were several with a black line over their portrait...Jakota? No, not the big gentle Tauren. Then a young man, perhaps a rogue or hunter, and someone else, but the picture was in the shadows.<br/><br/>He had all he needed to know, he had to get back to Cirque, this didn't bode well for his new family of friends and companions. He pulled back into the shadows, and pulled his mask on. Then moved towards the entrance he had used to get here.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, he didn't see the other shadow within the shadow move silently to intercept him.

Forge work was hot, tiring, and Neryth never felt happier than he did now. The artist loved working with his hands and molding the melted refined ores was one of the many tasks he enjoyed. Today it was more buckles. Those seamstresses, Wyn and Zyss were nearly frantic searching for some. And the paladin had stepped up to say he could make them.<br/><br/>As he worked, he noticed several men in black moving around the area, men of a most unsavory sort. They looked rugged and hard, and they tried to be sly, but he knew they were watching him. He placed several buckets around his forge in strategic spots, and stepped back into the ore shed to don his armor. There was going to be trouble, and he was preparing for it.<br/><br/>As he stepped out of the shed, two of the men were there to greet him, while several others could be seen moving towards him from across the way. <br/><br/>"Hold, and step away! Or by the Light, I will slay you where you stand!" <br/><br/>A tall lightly armored gent, removed his helm, and a night elf chuckled, and spoke softly, "Whoa, friend, we aren't here to attack you. We are here to protect you."<br/><br/>Just at that moment a terrible screamed filled the air as three dark nights came flying into a clearing on large skeletal mounts. "Damn, they're here already," the night elf cried, "Tynn, and Forz, go and greet them properly." Then the elf turned to the sindorei, "Come with me if you want to live, for they are here to kill you...all of you."<br/><br/>"Kill me? Who? All of us? Who are you?" the paladin gripped his axe and shield stepping back from the night elf.<br/><br/>"We don't have time for this, Neryth," the elf spoke quietly, "Trust the Light, and tell me what you feel."<br/><br/>There was a clash of steel as swords met swords and Neryth turned to stare at the battle.<br/><br/>"I'm sorry to do this." And a cloth was pressed over Neryth's face, and as he felt the world slip away from him, the night elf looked down at him, "The Master shall not have you."

Vanwë dressed her wounds half hazardly and gazed out towards the smoke billowing from the jungle. <br/><br/>Those explosives the rogue ‘borrowed’ from Mina’s tent were very effective. Whisper didn’t take them all of course and at the moment she was grateful for that. A message came up over her communication stone.<br/><br/>“Hey! Wench! You still alive?”<br/><br/>“Aye.” Her voice was strained but she still responded. “…some how.”<br/><br/>“Three parts luck, one part hero.” The voice boomed with a laugh.<br/><br/>“That’s three parts booze, one part fool.” Vanwe sounded tired. “What’d you want Revion?”<br/><br/>“Someone else is moving in on the Cirque…they have a grudge with that-“<br/><br/>“Gah!!!” Vanwe had tried to stand but the demon bite in her leg sent a stab of pain through her body. She panted. “I have only two people I care about in this world and they both have a knack at getting into trouble…or running with people that get them into trouble.”<br/><br/>“You mean like us? I get the feeling I’m not one of those two you mentioned. That kinda hurts!”<br/><br/>The rogue actually had to think about it. Van wasn’t sure what the nature of her and Revion’s relationship was. “Two and half.” She hobbled through the jungle. “I have to get to Thunderbluff to warn Mina.”<br/><br/>“You failed?” Revion sounded genuinely surprised and his voice took on a tone of deathly silence.<br/><br/>“Firnen is insane.” Vanwë whispers, the effort of navigating a jungle with her injuries making it difficult to speak. “He’s coming for her…I don’t know when…I don’t know how…but he is obsessed and will not rest till he has the woman’s soul.” <br/><br/>“Fel damn him.” A grumbling noise is heard over the stone. “Get to Mina; I’ll see what I can find out about Firnen.” <br/><br/>The stone went quiet, and silently the rogue slipped through the wilderness.

Mina lay asleep in the arms of Riavis. The emotional exhaustion of revealing her past to him meant her sleep would be deep and long. Their passionate love making, like two flames roaring against each other, may have also contributed to Mina’s stillness. Her tear stained face was pressed to Rivi’s chest and she clung to him in her sleep…<br/><br/><em>Years spent together…<br/><br/>Mina met Firnen during her mage training. He opened up her world to the pleasures of the body and soon after she gave him her heart. Not long into their relationship she discovered he was a warlock. Mina could’ve cared less, such was her devotion. Their life together was good and full of love.<br/><br/>Things changed after he returned from Northrend. Mina was no longer enough and Firnen’s desire for power and control began to permeate all things. The abuse Mina endured started slowly. The man invaded her mind bit by bit, abusing her body and slowly sapped her soul. Many foul acts had been committed. <br/><br/>House Cinderward remained oblivious to the plight of their daughter until the mages sister, Gwendhiril, a priestess of the Light opened Mina’s eyes. The bruises, the change in her demeanour and personality…it was all made clear in a single afternoon. <br/><br/>Fire raged within Minaethiel and rekindled what remained of her spirit. Mina ended things with Firnen that same day. He threatened to share every sordid detail of their private life to her friends and family and promised he would take her life if she left. Mina did not listen to these threats and returned to her family.…<br/><br/>Firnen made good on his first threat and Mina’s Father paid a heavy sum to keep his daughters dalliances a secret. Ashamed and shunned by all but her sister and the uncle who spirited her out of Silvermoon, Mina began a new life in Booty Bay. <br/><br/>This new life consisted of drink and dance. Soon enough Firnen found her, their final confrontation was a mixture of blood and fire. If not for the interference of a Sin’dorei named Revion, Mina would have died. Revion nearly killed Firnen that day, but Mina’s injuries had been severe and the warrior never confirmed his kill. Firnen was in the wind, alive and furious. <br/><br/>A meddling rogue named Vanwë and the warrior that saved Mina nursed her back to health in their own way. Damaged themselves, the three became fast friends. Outcasts together, they adventured throughout Azeroth, and bit by bit Mina began to rebuild herself. </em><br/><br/>Now, Firnen was back and this time it was Vanwë who failed at killing him. <br/><br/>Riavis didn’t know all of the dark details of Mina’s past and it was unlikely the Mage sleeping in his arms would ever speak them aloud. Even so, words could not express Mina’s thoughts at Rivi’s anger and protectiveness, or the surprise at the intensity of his emotions. <br/><br/>Day by day Mina fell deeper for her Silver Tongued Devil. Knowing Rivi cared for her even after all she had revealed, it lifted a burden she did not realise was there. For the first time Mina knew she could love again and that she was in love with Riavis!<br/><br/>But these thoughts were far from her mind and she slept on…

His world was crashing down around him, and his heart was broken as they split way from each other.

In a move to deaden that pain he went back to a very old habit he had given up. And he uncorked a bottle, and slid in and pulled the cork after him.<br/><br/>She found him wasted and disgusting on the porch of the inn.

Starting with a good long soak and bath. And then two, remember that his children needed him. Being shark food would not let them know the man who was their father.

But for his children, his son and daughter, he was willing to do whatever it took to see them and being a part of their lives.<br/><br/>Light it was hard, as the memories of Kel and his moments together would pop up for some reason.

((I hope you don’t mind that I put a vignette up for Auxi based upon the happenings the past week with Cy and Kel. If so, I will take it down. Unfortunately, I don't have another place to post for her.)) <br/><br/><em>She’d left them both with the same offer, ‘Come find me if you need to talk.’ She had seen Kel first. Then sought out Cy to confirm the news that she had been given. It was with a heavy heart that she left The Lazy Turnip to return to her home in Kun Lai, but there was nothing she could do to change what had happened. She could only offer her support.<br/><br/>Kel, for the moment, seemed to be holding together. Cy was wrecked. She sat and talked with him for a long while, slowly trying to ease him from the abyss that he was crawling into. When asked why she was even bothering, she reply had been simple, ‘No one came for me.’ He had thought she meant the death of her husband, but she was referring to when she had woken up in a hospital bed with no memory and no clue as to who she was. It was a stomach turning reality to know that no one cared enough to try to find her. She would not do that to anyone she called a friend.<br/><br/>Suddenly, heading back to Northrend to continue her personal sojourn seemed like a poor idea. No, no… she’d go, but perhaps delay the trip by a week or so to make certain that neither one of her two good friends opted to try anything foolish or needed a shoulder—it would have to be proverbial, as they were both at least a foot taller than she was—to cry on.<br/><br/>The woman with the brown hair walked across the upper story of a small house in Binan Village. The hour was late and the moon shown its silvery light in through the window to cast a glowing pool of quicksilver on the floor. The sounds of insects hummed in time with the gentle tattoo of lapping lake water and all was close to perfect that night.<br/><br/>It was nights like these that she missed him the most.<br/><br/>Going to the wardrobe she pulled out one of his shirts. She’d kept two, the rest of his clothing had been given away to several grateful people. She used the shirts to sleep in. They’d lost his scent a long time ago, but they still carried with them his comfort. Picking up a book—one that she’d read probably five or six times over the course of the three years that she had it—she settled in a chair by the hearth to read. A smile ghosted over her lips as the familiar words of the book enveloped her and she read about the character who had given her the name she carried now.<br/><br/>Two hours later, the puddle of moonlight on the floor remained, but the fire in the hearth burned low. The woman with the brown hair was still nestled in the chair, her face smooth and relaxed, the open book resting in her lap next to her limp hands as she slept peacefully.<br/></em>

<em>The paladin stretched out as the warm sheets and blanket covered her naked body. She had only one desire, to languish here all day and sleep until she was fully rested. She yawned softly as she rolled back to rest her head on the pillow. As she brought her hand up to fluff it, her eye caught the glimmer of the single solitare diamond ring on her finger.<br/><br/>She lay on her back holding her hand up staring at it. A shiver went through her body, as she remembered the man who proposed to her, and held her heart. Leon. She closed her eyes and brought the hand that had the ring down close to her chest. Leon. <br/><br/>How often did she dream of him holding her close, and felt his lips on hers. She had melted into that first kiss like a silly schoolgirl. And she would do it again to have him as her husband. He made her tremble with his touch, and she longed to be with him again and again. She couldn't to get enough of the handsome paladin.<br/><br/>Even as she lay there thinking about him, she faded into a sweet dream of him holding her in his arms. She pressed herself against his strong hard body and felt weak in the knees as his tender kiss lingered. Her arms went around his neck, and she kissed him again and again.<br/><br/>But something was wrong, his face felt strange, his lips flat and cool. And as she awoke from her daydream she found her lips pressed against her pillow. Her face grew hot and red, as she pulled away from it. However she also felt a heat growing within her as she remembered her dream, and the dream lover that was...Leon.</em>

The paladin smiled as he sat astride his charger, watching the sun set and slowly sink beneath the horizon, its final rays casting a golden glow over the ocean. The rays of the setting sun had contained a particular shade of red that reminded him of Jen'Tira and he had stayed to watch until the fading light forced him to seek shelter for the night.<br/><br/>It was almost dark as he found a quiet little inn and entered. There were only a few patrons so he was left to his thoughts as he sat by the fire sipping a mug of ale. His mind crossed the boundaries of time and space as he thought of the beautiful paladin that was to be his wife. She was so beautiful, she looked like a goddess and in battle she was so fierce. She was getting stronger. Soon, she would be strong enough to fight beside him in battle.<br/><br/>His lips curved into a smile as he thought of that day. How he longed for the day when she could stand beside him as they carved through the countless enemies he faced in Outland. No longer would they have to endure long separations, She would be able to travel with him, never to part.<br/><br/>He smiled as he dug through his bags and pulled out a small box. Inside was chain made of three strands, each of a different metal, that were twisted together to form a metal rope. Dangling from the chain was a ruby cut into the shape of a heart. The heart was also a locket, the catch and hinge cleverly hidden by the design. Inside the locket, he had placed a picture of himself. He closed the lid of the box and wrapped it to send to Jen'Tira.<br/><br/><em>My beautiful angel. It is my hope that this locket will ease your burden whenever we are parted by allowing you to carry a little part of me with you wherever you go. I love you. Leon.</em>

<em>She was fighting alone when the ghostly knights assaulted her. She was putting up a valiant fight, when she felt a chill, and one of the knights fell, its armor covered with a frosty residue. The other two succumb to the sword arms of both her blade, and the sindorei warrior that had joined her easily.<br/><br/>Jen'tira thanked the warrior, and they intoduced each other. This Dusk, as she wanted to be called, fought well, and Jen was glad to have her along as they wandered across the peninsula of Hellfire. Her methods were different than Jen's paladin ways, but still just as effective. And the paladin cleared her plate of quests and requests easily with the warrior's aid.<br/><br/>Then they decided to take on several of the subdivisions of the Citadel. Dusk took point as Jen healed and aided her through the long area called the Ramparts. They did well, and Dusk's fighting prowess was amazing. Then they ran into Jen'tira's fiance, Leon.<br/><br/>And the two paladins and the warrior swept through several of the areas of Hellfire Peninsula. Jen became protective of Leon, as Dusk called Leon "handsome", and flirted shamelessly with him. However, Leon assured Jen that she was the only woman that held his heart. And Jen was so proud of the way Leon carried their little trio forward through a place full of demons and warlocks.<br/><br/>They chose to relax in Shattrath City, in a little place called The World's End Tavern. She was probably rude to Dusk, as Jen found herself clinging to Leon, and sought to have him for herself.</em>

Silvermoon City -<br/><br/>Leon had left early that morning, and already she missed him. Jen'tira sighed as she proceeded to gather her armor to take to get it repaired. The armorer she went to worked magic on the dents and scratches she put in it as she made her journey through Azeroth. She prized his expertise, and was willing to spend a few extra coin to look good and feel good in her armor. <br/><br/>She also gathered her shield and sword. A warrior can only be as good as the tools of their trade, and Jen valued the whole ensemble as protection and offensive capability. It was a necessary evil to take care of her gear. Otherwise it could mean a world of hurt, or worse.<br/><br/>A knock came at the door, and she unsheathed her sword. "Yes?"<br/><br/>A young voice spoke through the door, "I have a package for a Jen'tira Whitemane."<br/><br/>Jen cautiously open the door, ready for anything. With the recent disappearance of several of the Cirque members, she wasn't taking any chances. She cracked the door, and saw a young Sin'dorei male in a uniform holding a small package. She opened the door, speaking calmly, "I'm Jen'tira Whitemane."<br/><br/>He offered the package to her, while his other hand was held out. "Oh, yes, the tip." She deftly reached into her side pouch and produced several silver pieces, then dropped them into the outstretched hand. <br/><br/>"Thank you, very much!"<br/><br/>Jen was already closing the door, as she looked at the package, wondering who could have sent it? Leon had just left, so it wouldn't be from him. Would it? She unwrapped the colorful paper, and her heart stopped as she saw the small box amongst the paper. A simple message on a small piece of paper on the box was in a script she recognized.<br/><br/><em>My beautiful angel. It is my hope that this locket will ease your burden whenever we are parted by allowing you to carry a little part of me with you wherever you go. I love you. Leon</em>.<br/><br/>She slowly opened the box, and she gasped as she looked at the lovely locket and three toned chain necklace it hung from. She held it delicately in her hands as she looked at it. Then her finger accidently touched a catch on the heart-shaped locket, and it slowly sprung open to display a picture of her Leon. <br/><br/>Tears came to her eyes as she was overwhelmed by the thoughtfulness of sending her this, and how he must have kept it a secret from her as it was being made. Jen brought the opened locket to her lips as she kissed the perfect image of her beloved Leon. Her voice was hoarse and soft as she whisper to the picture, "I love you, my darling."<br/><br/>The paladin closed the locket, and went to the mirror, her fingers putting it around her slender neck, and clasping the chains together. She smiled as she admired the craftsmanship and beauty of the locket. The locket rested just above the swell of her breasts, and she turned this way and that way enjoying the way it looked, nestled on her chest.

It was difficult those few short hours he spent with his daughter and son. Kel'tira was there enjoying him playing with them, and holding them. To see her smile, to even hear her laughter was difficult for him. And when it came to go, he touched her hand, and gently squeezed it in his own. He told Kel he would be there if she ever needed him to be, for the children or herself. For he still loved and cared for her as deeply as he ever did. She had reached out and touched his cheek, and she had told him she appreciated that.<br/><br/>The tears flowed as he flew back to his small little farm. His heart ached at not being able to love and care for his wife like he wanted too. He still loved her deeply, and he wasn't sure he could ever love again. She knew him inside and out. Just as he did her. <br/><br/>The rogue sighed deeply as he landed outside the warm cozy shed he now called home. Cy could find things to occupy his time during the days, but it was the nights that were the worst. He wondered if she missed laying in his arms as much as he did having Kel close to him. The loving kisses and soft whispers of affirmation of their love for one another. Again his eyes burned with tears with the close memories of Kel'tira, and the children. <br/><br/>Light, it hurt, it hurt so damn much.

I suppose I can see why Zyss fell for that little do gooder paladin of hers. For I have found one too. At least for now, I'm never one to let myself become too attached to a man. They tend to grunt and scratch themselves too much to keep around too long. But this one, well, he saved me from becoming a Vrykul shaman's pet, so I'll enjoy his company for a little longer.<br/><br/>Oh, did I fail to mention he's a human? Oh, my is he ever build like a mountain. It's hard for me to keep my hands off all those muscles, and yet he holds me gently within those big strong arms. And I love being pressed up against that powerfully built chest. Oh, my...he is so good to me and for me. I really need to find a razor for him though, that beard of his tickles in the most interesting of places.<br/><br/>He's taken me to Shattrath City. And I do believe he enjoys showing me off. Not that I mind, I note the eye of envy from his other human friends, and the look my brethren give me. I laugh them off, if they even knew one tenth of what he does for me they would walk away with their tail tucked between their legs. I use that figuratively, but you know what I mean.<br/><br/>Oh, my sweet Jorym, he holds me close, and I melt into his arms. And his kisses are powerful and passionate, and I find myself wanting them more and more. I wonder if all human males are like this, or if Jorym is special? Regardless, I shall be spending several more weeks with him, and enjoying his company. In public and in private.
