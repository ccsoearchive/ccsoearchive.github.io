In the Ghostlands, Riavis looked over the shambling undead. They were mindless wretches, knowing only killing and agony. He rode his dreadsteed through the throngs and watched as his voidwalker slaughtered them. <br/><br/>"There has to be a way to use them...not as mindless zombies...but as true soldiers. They walk, they fight, but how to turn them to a better cause?" he is speaking mainly to himself. <br/><br/>The succubus walking beside him shrugged. "Perhaps some music to unite them? Give them purpose....make them dance! Master, that is my advice. Use that magnificent magical instrument you have. You did imbue it with power...why not see if you can lead them to the Undercity, make them see the options."<br/><br/>Riavis turned to her with an incredulous stare. "Use my screaming guitare to entice them? My dear!! That is brilliant! Will it work?" his eyes went back to the undead as they raced after the voidwalker in mindless fury.<br/><br/>She snapped her whip and cooed softly, "Try it...you will like it..."<br/><br/>Stepping off his dreadsteed, Riavis dug into his pack and brought out the instrument. He had originally meant it for a torture device. But he had found a few who actually liked the music he made with it. Gathering the magic into the hollow of the wood and steel instrument he began to play.<br/><br/>The voidwalker beat on the rocks and trees nearby making a stacatto accompaniment. The succubus added shrill screaming lyrics as Riavis shredded his licks joyously.<br/><br/>(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMsMMqMb0g)<br/><br/>To his amazement he had the undead dancing and gathering around him. The music transcended the bonds of the Lich King, gave them new purpose...but would it stick after he stopped playing? How would he get them to Undercity? Could he march them through Silvermoon?<br/><br/>This posed a problem...how was he going to get them through the guards? He started moving towards Silvermoon, looking to see if they even followed him. He grinned and played harder, the shrill music echoing through the Scar. As he moved they continued to dance around him soon stringing along behind him, gathering more as they went.<br/><br/>Vaguely he wondered if he might meet someone along the way that might pass the message. He was recruiting new Forsaken with music!!

He should have known better, with no warning he kept leading the undead closer to Silvermoon. They danced and marched up the Scar, gathering more as they went. Some fell to the guards at the crossroads but Riavis did not see what happened, he was lost in his wild riffs. The voidwalker kept up a ratting stacatto with some bones and a barrel he had picked up somewhere. <br/><br/>The succubus screeched like a banshee and kept them all lined up as they cavorted in a mass heading straight for the city Gates. The guards nearly had heart attacks!! Calls were sent into the city and a handful of Farstriders came rushing out of the Shepard's Gate, mowing down the undead before they even got to the gardens.<br/><br/>Riavis looked around at his companions falling left and right, "NO!! I was taking them to Sylvanus! They like the music...I had them all enthralled!! Stop!!" <br/><br/>But it was too late and the Captain marched up to Riavis with an angry look on her face. "You call that music? It was banshee wailing and screeching and drums from hell!! I ought to have you clapped in irons for disturbing the peace of Eversong!" she was livid.<br/><br/>Riaven stared at her for a moment, "You are so beautiful when you are angry...I think I am in love..." he whispered to her with puppy dog eyes. He ducked as she aimed her sheild at him.<br/><br/>"Get out of here before I spike your hair with tar and add some feathers!!" she screamed at him. <br/><br/>He ran, as fast as he could and ducked into the gardens before the gate. "Such passion! I wonder if her husband even appreciates her?" he chuckled softly.

Taking out his accoustic guitar, Rivi, as he liked to be called, strummed it softly as he contemplated his recent discovery. No it was not the fact that undead liked his wildly shredding guitar music, it was the glance of a shy maiden. <br/><br/>A melody tickled his mind as he picked it out on the guitar, words came to him slowly as he rebuilt the scene in his mind.<br/><br/>----------------<br/><br/>Unspoken<br/><br/>It was only a passing glance<br/>It was only the ghost of a smile.<br/><br/>It was only an unspoken wish,<br/>It was only an unheard sigh.<br/><br/>It sent the mind to dreaming, <br/>It send the heart 'to a spin.<br/><br/>It made a hand pluck a flower,<br/>It stopped the world with a wish.<br/><br/>It wanted to offer the bloom,<br/>It wanted to savor the fragrance.<br/><br/>It missed the chance for a comment, <br/>It lost the sight of the goal.<br/><br/>It is lost in the memory of 'what if's'<br/>It is saddened for no reason why.<br/><br/>It was only a passing glance,<br/>It was only the ghost of a smile...<br/><br/>((this fits well with the lyrics- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UogNgeSlJ-A )

Magic, the atmosphere around Silvermoon is full of it. A mage sat peacefully in the garden outside the city, enjoying the peace and quiet. Her deck of cards seemed to be suspended before her in the warm air. Each card was ornately decorated with varying colors of flame. <br/><br/>Whatever the cards were showing her, the elf clearly did not like. The woman’s nose wrinkled in displeasure. Minaethiel hated reading such as these; the cards dropped to a heap in the grass. With a sour expression Mina returned the cards to their deck pondering the meaning of what was revealed…<br/><br/>…Her thoughts were interrupted by the soft melody of a guitar…a slow smile spread across the mages face and she followed the sound to its source. A slight dance to her step, she listened to the lyrics and waited for the song to reach its end. “Found you.” <br/><br/>Mina pulled a strand of red hair out of her face and grinned brilliantly at the guitarist. “What lovely sound…does your muse have name?”

Riavis looked up at the sound of her voice and smiled. "I have been inspired, will you join me? Usually I play much more raucous music. But sometimes a soft mood strikes me. What do you think of the song?" his voice wistful as he gazed at the pretty mage.<br/><br/>It was one thing to flirt openly with many people around, it gave him a reputation as a player and a scoundrel. It was quite another to sit beside a beauty and try not to stumble over his own tongue. His attitude was shyer and more self concious. He tried to cover it with his music. The only thing that gave him any confidence.<br/><br/>(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaF-MOq_uRQ)<br/><br/>He sang to her, the song of a drunk who only had success when he was drinking.

Mina swayed slowly with Rivi’s tune. A gentle smile slid across her lips at the lyrics. For a moment she closes her eyes as though she is remembering something from long ago. As quickly as the moment comes it passes and her eyes open again. Mina watches Rivi’s every move, enthralled by his voice and talent. <br/><br/>A soft sigh escapes her lips as the song draws to an end. Mina is silent for a moment as she shakes off the strange feeling of nostalgia Rivi’s song brought to her heart and flashes him one of her brilliant smiles. “That was wonderful! But I have a hard time believing you require drink to charm unsuspecting maidens.” She teases with a playful wink.

The music continued softly as he played for her. A sly grin crossed his face at her words. "But there is that...unsuspecting maidens maybe, those are easily swayed with the music. The ones who intrigue with the hint of more to offer, the ones who play with the strings of the heart...those are the ones..." he trailed off.<br/><br/>He bent his head to the guitar, still playing softly. An intricate melody played across the strings, making him concentrate on the strings.

<blockquote>The music continued softly as he played for her. A sly grin crossed his face at her words. "But there is that...unsuspecting maidens maybe, those are easily swayed with the music. The ones who intrigue with the hint of more to offer, the ones who play with the strings of the heart...those are the ones..." he trailed off. </blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote>He bent his head to the guitar, still playing softly. An intricate melody played across the strings, making him concentrate on the strings. He caressed them and plucked them, occasionally tapping on the wooden part of the guitar to make a drum like sound. His song was intriguing, he glanced at her from the corner of his eye. He wanted to say more. But he let his song do the talking. </blockquote><br/><br/>Minaethiel’s feet began to skip in time to the song. She watched as Rivi’s fingers agilely hit cords with a skill and grace few could master. The melody was heart stirring; the passion Riavis evoked built slowly in her chest. People stopped to watch the master play his instrument. Clearly he evoked passion in others as well, though she sensed it was her reaction he was looking for. <br/><br/>The mages hand tapped lightly against her side and when Mina could no longer stand it she rose and smiled brilliantly at Riavis. Mina let her fiery red hair loose and adjusted her dress to make for easy movement. With a slight sway of the hips the woman was soon lost in his music. <br/><br/>Sparks flew from her finger tips and if one looked close enough, her feet also. Every movement was fluid, timed to match Rivi’s playing. Flaming ribbons escaped her hands; those who had gathered to watch were going to received quite the show. Mina would never notice the gathering of people. This dance was for the one playing the guitar, not for the crowd. <br/><br/><blockquote>His playing grew more intense and faster. It would be hard to remain seated. Indeed here on the nearly deserted beach, those walking the sands came closer as he played, couples dancing and some even singing a few nonsense syllables to it. He smiled and kept playing, making them all dance and twirl with the near frantic beat. </blockquote><br/><br/>Orange and gold cracked across the night air as the woman twisted and twirled to the music. Each movement graceful and controlled….Mina was lost in the song...her body moving to the melody Riavis had created.<br/><br/><blockquote>Someone started a bonfire and soon more gathered on the beach. As he slowed it down and then stopped, he looked down at his fingers. They were raw from the playing, he needed to stop. A cold mug of mead was offered and he accepted. Glancing to Mina he smiled. "It seems we have company. Did I do that? Or was it the sparks from your fingertips?" his voice teasing and coy. </blockquote><br/><br/>As the song came to an end the Fire Mage’s ribbons of flame dissolved into sparks like fireflies. The sparks would linger in the air for sometime after... <br/><br/>Panting and with a racing heart, only now Mina truly saw the group that had gathered. Drinking, dancing and laughing couples and friends. Someone handed her a cold drink and she accepted with a clumsy bow. How long had she been dancing? Sore sand covered feet suggested a long time had passed. The elf took a swig of her mead and let out a brilliant laugh, before returning to Rivi’s side. <br/><br/>Mina chuckled softly and her green eyes smouldered. “I do believe it was you more than I, my Silver Tongued Devil.” Her voice then purred. “You have a gift that stirs the heart and mind…not just the undead.” Gently Mina reached out and stroked Rivi’s raw finger tips with her own. “Perhaps someday you could teach me to play?”<br/><br/>((Hope the use of quotes was alright ;) ))

His heart beat a staccato in his chest as her fingers touched his. The warmth there he expected, the sparks still flew even though none could see them. What threw him was the way she stroked his raw fingertips. They were sensitive from his playing and even through the callouses he could feel it. <br/><br/>He lifted his gaze to her eyes, the depth of which he felt he would drown in. A dryness settled in his throat, he would be damned if he would allow her to...but that thought flew past his fingers and off into the sunset. He curled his fingers over hers and allowed a smile to tickle his lips as he held her gaze with his. The dark green jade of his eyes saw her challenge and met it with his own. "I would be delighted to teach you, if you are willing to learn. It takes many years of practice. You will have sore fingers, you will develop callouses on them as the weeks go on. If you do not give up, that is." he held her hand in his and gently brought it to his lips.<br/><br/>The noise of the others around the bonfire was forgotten as he breathed across the back of her hand. His lips were warm and gentle. The kiss left a tiny amount of moisture that the air cooled. He smiled then and let her hand go to reach for the guitar. He placed the strap around her neck and settled it in her lap. "I assume you are right handed, no?" he asked before he reached for the mug of mead to wet his lips. <br/><br/>He took a long drink of the mead. Watching her as she handled the guitar. "One hand here to press down on the strings, it changes the sound the string makes when you stroke it with your other hand." he pointed to the frets on the neck of the guitar. <br/><br/>"Play with it, stroke it with your fingers. Do not be afraid to pluck it, strum softly or fast and sharp. It takes time to learn. But for now...just play with it. Let me see if you can figure it out. I will help as I can." he smiled encouragement and sat back to watch her. His voice had been low and gentle, not speaking to anyone else but her.

<em> A secluded area in Eversong</em><br/><br/>Illisidel Lightsun leaned against a tree, "Where the fel is he, I know sneaking into Horde territory is difficult, but that man really needs to learn punctuality."<br/><br/>A slight hollow chuckle can be heard from the other side of the tree, "And you need to get better at sensing people's prescence." The voice startled the paladin, but he recovered quickly in time to give Dalfein Scourgebane a reproachful glare. The death knight laughed, "Don't look at me like that, in truth I just got here, it was a joke, lighten up."<br/><br/>Illis sighed, "Fine whatever did you bring what I asked for," the paladin had asked the death knight, someone he had met during the war in Northrend, to pick up a few things for him from Dalaran.<br/><br/>The death knight nodded, "Still don't know why you couldn't get them yourself, all you have to do is mention the Argent Crusade, and they wouldn't hassle you," shrugging not really caring either way, he handed the paladin a sack. It was filled with tools, and items neccessary for cleaning instruments, "I still don't know why you just don't buy this stuff from Silvermoon."<br/><br/>The paladin shot him a glare, "Because Dalaran has the best stuff, what I can get in Silvermoon doesn't even compare, I will not clean my instruments with second grade materials."<br/><br/>Dalfein laughed, and held up his hands, "Alright easy there killer, it was just an observation, I don't care either way, you said I could keep whatever money was left so I am happy, take care my friend." The death knight summoned a Death Gate, and stepped through it, Illis waved goodbye to his friend, smiling a bit, this was how their meetings always went, and they certainly didn't see each other enough, but Dalfein was busy with his work for the Ebon Blade so it was understandable. Illis made his way back to Silvermoon, he would drop his items off at home, then go to the beach to do his evening prayers.<br/><br/><em> At the beach</em><br/><br/>Illis streched out on the sand, sighing in contentment, he enjoyed taking a moment to relax before he began his prayers, he pulled out his prayer book, and opened to his nightly prayer. He began reading, quietly enjoying the soft sounds of the water, and the cool evening breeze. His peace didn't last long, as loud music, and racous laughter, and screaming reached his ears, the noise breaking his concentration on the prayer. He looked in the direction of the offending noise, to see not too far down the beach a party had started, when did they arrive, he wondered he had not even noticed their prescence until now.<br/><br/>Maybe Dalfein was right, maybe he did need to improve his ability to sense other people around him, of course there is always the chance they had been fairly quiet until now as well. His face took on a look of annoyance, and disgust as he watched them drinking, and acting like drunken fools, couldn't they have picked somewhere else, or at least have been considerate enough to move their party when they noticed him trying to study. "Of course I guess I could always move, there is a chance they were here first," he shook his head, regardless they should have more consideration for other people. The paladin sighed, it didn't matter now his concentration had been broken, and he didn't even have any of his instruments to pass the time with. So with nothing else to do he lay back on the sand folding his hands behind his head, maybe they would go away soon, and he could get back to enjoying his evening.

At Rivi’s touch, a tremor of excitement ran through Mina’s body. From the moment he took her hand, all other party goers ceased to exist. Riavis’s lips were soft against her hand, and from her own lips fell the softest of gasps. Warmth spread through out her body. Mina took another sip of mead to add courage and to help her control the fire building within. <br/><br/>The woman stared into Rivi’s eyes as if searching for something; she could feel her grin widening. Riavis rose to her challenge and he knew this game well; Mina would have to be more careful…<br/><br/>Mina nodded and held the guitar gently. Her hands explored the sleek wood and caressed the rough strings. This instrument seemed precious to Rivi and she could see that he took exceptional care of it. She held the neck in her left hand, ready to strum the body with the right. “Is this correct?” She asked her voice soft, but her mind focused on the task at hand. <br/><br/>“Ahhh.” Mina’s gaze had been on Rivi for sometime, so mimicking where he put his hands on the neck of the guitar seemed simple enough. The strings bit into Mina’s fingers and she knew they would leave indents behind. Even so she kept her hands in place, practising placement for a minute. Guitar balanced in her lap, Mina hesitantly strummed her first note. The sound made her jump slightly and wince with an apologetic smile. After Rivi played so beautifully it seemed a shame to ruin the nights sounds with her fumbling. <br/><br/>Biting the bottom of her lip, Mina risked a shy glance at Rivi. The glance lasted only a moment, and then she began to strum again. The woman’s focus was now entirely on the guitar. Soon she began to produce actual sounds, using the hand movements she had seen Rivi use earlier. The cords cut into Mina’s fingers, but she did as he asked. Experimenting with varying speeds and notes, though Mina was certain the sound of her attempt was horrible. Ears were likely going to bleed this night.<br/><br/>When Mina finished, she winked at the man. “I think I may be once of those people that will take years to learn. Good thing we elves are long lived.”

Following her every move, Riavis sipped his mead. He thought of the many maidens he had been with in his life. Some innocent and some not. Mina was beautiful, she had a fire about her that evoked an answer in the depth of his being. She was such a smart gal, knowing as much of magic as she did. He wondered if she even noted the magic that flowed within him.<br/><br/>He did not often use it, only to protect himself and to do what had to be done to stay in the good graces of the nobles of Silvermoon. The magic he used was not exactly frowned upon, it had it's uses. How often had he heard the phrase "Fight fire with fire"? Only in his case the fire they were talking about was pulled from the Nether.<br/><br/>There were some who condemned this way of being. He had taken to it like a duck to water. His strong will and charisma helped him in many ways. It was dangerous he knew very well. He also knew that he took a risk every time he told someone what he was. <br/><br/>It had taken him a few times of total rejection from maidens he fancied to learn to keep it under his hat. He doubted he would ever find someone to truly capture his heart. He had taken to reacting with guile and playfulness. Not taking anyone seriously, perhaps fearing another broken heart. But then again, he had never truly given his heart.<br/><br/>"You are doing well, and yes it takes years. If you do not practice everyday, who knows how long it would take? My grandfather said to me many times, "A laborer works with his hands, a craftsman works with his head and his hands, but an artist works from hands, head and heart. You dance with your heart, Mina. Graceful, agile and beautiful. Be proud of what you are. Not many can do it with your style." he smiled as he watched her. <br/><br/>Finally he got up and sat behind her, leaning over her shoulder to place his hands over hers and gently guiding her. "Loosen your hands, let them caress the strings to bring forth the music, like this." his other hand on the neck of the guitar to show her how to hold the strings there one finger at a time. He was close to her, the warmth of his chest pressing on her back as he strummed the guitar then plucked gently and quickly. His warm breath smelled slightly of the mead as it flowed across her neck and shoulder.<br/><br/>This close to her he could feel the arcane energy dancing in her system. She was going to be a very powerful mage some day. If she continued as she was, she would learn to detect the magic around her. If her teachers were good enough to teach that, as his had been.

Mina felt her self blush at the compliment, perhaps the mead and atmosphere were getting to her? Or maybe it was simply Riavis and his charm? Was he sincere in his words? And if he was, did she care? Wasn’t this supposed to be a game? Trying to shake the dreamy look in her eyes as she succumbed to the mood was becoming…difficult. <br/>“Your grandfather sounds like a wise man. He must be proud of your own skill.”<br/><br/>The warmth of Riavis against her back sent a surge of desire through Mina. Mina had always been poor at sensing the magical abilities of others. She knew those who could tell the difference between a mage and a warlock in a heart beat. There were those in the magical community that could measure strength and skill with just a mere feeling. No, she was definitely not of that skill level. With Riavis so near, she could feel his power through the light silk of her robes. He hummed with energy…but what kind? Mina pushed the thought out of her mind; she was focused on the here and now. Focused on Rivi’s warm breath dancing across her skin.<br/><br/>Mina leaned in to him slightly. Her own scent was a perfume of spice, warmth and some flower one could not easily place. It mingled with the smell of mead, adding to the moment. Mina turned towards Rivi and gently caressed the side of his face. Her thumb brushed his lips softly. Emerald green eyes staring into his, her intent couldn’t have been clearer.<br/><br/>“I think…I have had enough guitar lessons for one night.” Mina’s voice softly purred.

A devilish smile played across his lips as she turned and leaned closer. "Are you sure about that? With all these people around us you tease me. There are some things you should know about me. All is not as simple as it seems." but he would not pass up an opportunity to kiss her sweet lips. <br/><br/>The fire in his eyes of jade became just a bit brighter, the unmistakable tint of fel was there. But he had only given her a glimpse of it as he closed them and leaned in to kiss her softly. With all the party goers around them he would not do more than that. He would let her think on what she had seen if she even paid attention. <br/><br/>The mystery that was Riavis deepened. Party goers will not be so quick to judge him, but clamored for more music. He chuckled as he drew back and took his guitar from Mina. "We must please the crowd, my dear. Will you dance for them again? Perhaps Kass and Illis will come and play with us. I thought I saw him down the beach there, trying to be reclusive again." he only moved enough to get his guitar around his neck. She was close enough to be touching him, and he taunted her with the look in his eyes. The flicker of fel winking at her in jade of his gaze.<br/><br/>This game was exciting to him and he knew how to play. Tease and retreat...taunt with mystery...but do not allow them to become too close. He had been hurt before by rejection. He was cautious for a reason.

The kiss though soft, set Mina’s body a flame. Rivi’s words had become lost in the moment. What she needed to know about him could wait for now. She was grateful for that kiss; it masked the shadow that had momentarily passed over her own eyes. The glint in Rivi’s memorizing gaze was one Mina had seen before. The unmistakable gleam of fel energy…<br/><br/>Rivi’s soft lips against her washed away her doubts, and any dark thoughts. Fel gleam or no, she was out to enjoy herself. <br/><br/>“I will not dance for the crowd.” Mina purred in a low voice. She reached out and pushed a loose strand of Rivi’s hair back into place. “But I shall dance for you.” She kissed him once on the cheek in a playful manner and stood. A gentle sway of her hips teasing Rivi and showing she was ready to begin the dance again. Her eyes grazed the crowd looking for the familiar faces of her new found friends, Kass and Illis. If they were present, the crowd would surely enjoy the show.

Her touch sent a shiver down his spine. What was she doing with him? Was it some kind of game she played? He watched as she got up, shifting her hips enticingly. For a few minutes he wished the crowd had not gathered. What would it be like to do more than a sweet kiss? He was far from a slouch between the sheets. Her swaying hips and fiery eyes tempted him.<br/><br/>He shook his head and bent to the guitar, making the music soar and dance like his emotions. He had been burned before, he knew this game. She would see the fel in his eyes and drop him like an insect she found crawling around. He would never find the one who lit the fire in his heart.<br/><br/> In spite of his calling he was not evil, he used the fel to defeat the enemies of Silvermoon. His teachers had tried to get him to do more. But he refused to call many demons. He liked fire, he played with it, shaped it, made it into a weapon or a work of art. His guitar screamed as he laid down a riff so crazy and wild it made the dancers around him howl with appreciation. His magic embued the guitar with a fierce sound. It howled and screamed the melody in there somewhere. His fingers moving like a blur, he paid no attention to anything but his fingers on the strings.<br/><br/>A troll wandering down the beach joined in with a drum he carried on his back. Someone found a few more things to bang on, shields and hollow logs, whatever was handy. The noise was enough to wake the dead. Which it did...in numbers! From the Scar a dozen ghouls and skeletons danced down the beach towards them. They howled in delight adding their ghostly shrieks and screams to the din. Rivi was not paying attention to them. He was lost in making the guitar nearly blister his hands.<br/><br/>(( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg7gZCZ_ODk ))

Kass laid her hand on Riavis' shoulder and smiled in greeting. "Steady on there Rivi. I'm not dressed to go hunting and these undead are starting to scare some of the people here."<br/><br/>She smiled as she looked around the gathered crowd. Her smile faded as she saw that the face she had been hoping to see wasn't among the crowd. It was further down the beach, sitting apart from the crowd, as usual.<br/><br/>The appreciative glances of the men in the crowd as she moved through them restored her confidence and her smile. The huntress to advantage of a short break in the music to give Mina a hug. "Back in a few minutes. I'm going to see if I can convince stick in the mud to join us."<br/>She turned to Riavis with a smile. "Save a song or two for me. I don't want your fingers worn out before I get to sing."<br/><br/>The huntress moved down the beach, stopping to greet the men who eyed her lean frame hungrily. A smile played about her lips, knowing that if she chose to even smile at one, the man would be at her side in a heartbeat. But that night, she wasn't in the mood to play her usual games. Her target was perhaps the one person in Silvermoon City that could resist her. <br/><br/>Why Illisidel intrigued her was only known to her. If asked, she would merely shrug that he was a challenge and she could never resist a challenge. The truth was a lot more complex than that. She had seen something in his eyes during an unguarded moment that had spoken to her. Something that told her that he had once enjoyed life to the full and a great tragedy had driven that underground.<br/><br/>As she got closer to him, her eyes took in a sight that gripped her heart and slowed her steps. Illisidel was in a mood that clearly said he wanted to be alone. She stopped just beside him and stood looking down at Illisidel, a war going on in her mind. Which side won, even she wasn't sure of. The huntress knelt beside him, kissed him lightly on the cheek, then stood and brushed the sand off her black jeans.<br/><br/>"I would love it if you could join us Illis. It's not the same without you there. Even if you just sing with me. Still, I can't make you. Take care."<br/><br/>Kass turned and returned to the others, a smile on her lips and her hips swaying to the music Riavis was playing. She stood beside Riavis and grinned as she added her voice to the music.

Illis, had heard the approaching footsteps, but he had hoped feigning ignorance, would get them to leave him alone. When he could finally see who it was, he knew his plan wouldn't work, but he decided to try it anyway. For a moment he thought it might be working, Kass seemed to hesitate, and be debating something in her mind, figuring she would go away, he closed his eyes. They shot open as he felt the kiss on his cheek, his hand shooting up to it in shock, "What the fel..." but she was already gone back to the party. He frowned over at the party goers, if Kass, was here that could only mean Riavis, and Mina were here as well, "Great so much for my quiet evening," he muttered.<br/><br/>His paladin instincts were screaming at him that something evil was near, and he sighed knowing it could only be undead. He got up, and sure enough he could see undead, coming up the Scar towards the party, "Damn you Riavis," the paladin had deduced fairly quickly that there was more to that special guitar the man carried, just like there was more to him. Illis was pretty sure he had pieced together what Riavis was, but as long as he didn't cause any direct harm, the paladin would let him be, but as for the undead. Unfortunately he had not brought his weapon, though still carrying an old injury from Northrend, he could still swing his massive two handed sword easily enough, luckily he didn't need a weapon to deal with this fodder.<br/><br/>His peaceful night had been ruined, so this undead fodder, would serve to make him feel better, he walked along the Scar, heading directly for the danging undead. He shook his head again, and cursed Riavis one more time, as his body was surrounded by the Light, he walked among the undead the Light so intense that they seemed to just fall apart as he passed. Some burst into flame, the few who tried to attack him were destroyed with a blast of the holy Light, he wasn't sure if the party goers noticed or not, and frankly he didn't care. "More than likely to damn drunk to appreciate the situation they are in," he shrugged, and continued on with his holy work.

He had looked up for just a brief moment when Kass touched his shoulder. It seemed to break the spell, and he wound down the music to a less intense strumming. He saw the Light flashing as Illis came down the Scar towards the beach. He stopped playing and hung his head. <br/><br/>For once he wished he could get through, just once. He gritted his teeth and muttered under his breath, "Here he comes, Mr. Holier than thou. Suddenly I am not in the mood to play." he put his guitar in the case and slug it over his shoulder. He needed to come to grips with the thought of Illis spending time with them. He was part of the group. <br/><br/>He turned to look at Mina as she spun and danced. The drummers were still going strong and Illis had taken care of the undead. Kass was there to sing and she could do it well. If they were to become an act to perform together, they had to get along, he knew that. Right now he needed to get his anger under control. <br/><br/>He walked off down the beach, finding a quiet cove where he took his shirt and slacks off and dove into the cold water. His guitar and clothes stacked on the rocks. He dove under the water, using his spell to breath underwater. He searched the sand and found some clams with the possibility of pearls. <br/><br/>He was under a long time, maybe a good half hour. Swimming underwater calmed him. Soothed his spirit, cooled the anger boiling inside of him. When he finally surfaced most of the party goers had gone. Shadows danced with flame as the bonfire blazed on the beach. He debated if he could stand to be chided for bringing the undead to the beach. Maybe it was a silly idea, but he wanted to believe it was true. Some of them had to be smart enough to survive, could't they see that the Scourge was just the same as the Forsaken? They had no choice, they were torn from graves and thrust back into the misery of life. Even if he could salvage one...just one...wouldn't it be worth it?<br/><br/>He swam to shore and sat on the rocks drying himself off with sand and his shirt. He shivered and knew he needed to get back to the fire to warm up. It was late, maybe Mina and Kass and...Illis, had gone back to Silvermoon. Staring at the moon he wondered if he ever stood a chance with Mina?

Swept away by the crowd and the music Mina became lost in her dance. Eventually music began to wind down and she with it. <br/><br/>Mina had barely stopped her movement to visit with Kass, and then continued on dancing. Somewhere in the back of her mind Mina knew that Rivi had called the undead to join them and she thought for certain she saw Illis clearing them out but something bid her to continue on. When her mind snapped out of its trance and Mina found she was standing alone in a sea of people. <br/><br/>Kass, Illis and Rivi gone, lost amongst the faces of people she did not know.<br/><br/>Mina waded through the crowd searching for Rivi a frown set on her lips. The woman stopped abruptly and shrugged it off. Feeling concern for a man who held her interest was never a good sign. Besides Mina wasn’t looking for anything more than a goodtime, and as far as she could tell Rivi was the same. Wasn’t he? <br/><br/>Again the dancer pushed thoughts and questions out of her mind. Mina let out a disappointed sigh; she had hoped their game would end in fire and passion. The game would continue tomorrow…and Mina would have to find another to satisfy her needs tonight. <br/><br/>Her gaze fell onto a young Sin’dorei with a quiet demeanour and a soft smile; he seemed out of place in the massive party that had formed. Their gazes met and Mina flashed him a brilliant smile and walked over to him. That poor young man would not know what him this night…
