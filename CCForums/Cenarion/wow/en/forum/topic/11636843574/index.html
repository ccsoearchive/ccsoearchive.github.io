Devynn Khandhesi looked up from her cup of tea, and pushed back an errant strand of blonde hair from her face, the sound of her Core hound pup broke her of her concentration. She was going over her reports she had to file with the Argent Crusade, nasty business up in Northrend since the fall of The Lich King, scourge forces that had not dropped arms were quickly found and dispatched. The rest of time was spent training the remaining Horde and Alliance forces recruits to handle operations in the region. Devynn had received reports that Deathwing had returned and put a hurting on the world as a whole, she was given permission from her superiors to join her friends and put an end to his wanton devastation. She managed to get the Dragon Soul for Thrall but was unable to join in the final fight as matters took her back to Northrend.<br/><br/>Devynn hated being stuck in Northrend as a glorified babysitter, the scourge was all but finished, Naxxramas was just a hovering shell of itself, and Yogg-Saron was contained. She tried not to dwell on the why but focus on her duties and keep her mind off other things.<br/><br/>She started out the day like any other, cold and miserable, she drew her cloak tight around her to try to keep some of the chill out and mounted up on her horse called Vindicator. The streets of Dalaran still had the hustle and bustle from before the fall of the Lich King, and it was in the din of this noise she heard a lad saying that there were new tensions between the Horde and the Alliance, she dismounted and went to the lad who was handing out flyers, about what had happened after Deathwing's defeat. <br/><br/>NEW CONTINENT DISCOVERED TO THE FAR SOUTH! PRINCE ANDUIN MISSING! GAROSH AND VARIAN CALLING ALL FORCES BACK!<br/><br/>Devynn took the flyer and tucked it away, went to her commanding officer and requested a leave, the officer only granted her 5 weeks then she was to return. She was furious, the Blood Knights while strict were at least happy with her performance, it seemed there was no pleasing these Argent Crusaders. So she went and made the most she could of her 5 weeks of leave, it was fun to explore again and to hang out with her old friends of the Coterie, she missed them so being stuck in Northrend all the time. The new faces were also refreshing to see. She made the most of her time in Pandaria, but was called back to her 'sworn' duty.<br/><br/>Around this time Devynn was getting fed up with not being able to see her friends, her family, and see all that the world had to offer. So she went to see her Commanding officer. During the flight to the Argent Grounds she thought long and hard about what to say, but when she saw the Commander sitting behind his desk, all decorum left her and she barged in going on pure adrenaline....<br/>"Commander Adian, I would speak with you about my assignment here in Northrend."<br/>The Commander a human, was about 5'2 with short salt and pepper colored hair, a whitening beard and a rather rotund shape, he had let himself go since the days of the assault on Icecrown Citadel.<br/>"What is the meaning of this intrusion, Davynn?" he exclaimed loudly<br/>"First of all Its Devynn, Sir" She said sarcastically "Secondly I want out, Since I have been here YOU have treated me like your personal servant doing your duties while you sit here getting, quite frankly fat. I have been a loyal member of this Crusade and you reap the benefits of my hard work! No more effective this day I am resigning from the Crusade, I am going back to my people!"<br/>Adian had never seen this side of Devynn before, no one had actually, she was quite good and keeping her temper in check but when push comes to shove she shoves back, Hard.<br/>"But, but, but...." She cut him off "Don't bother with this is for the greater good, don't give me that we are doing the light work here, the light has left this forsaken hole and has turned to help out in other areas that need us most, MY work here is done. I have lost much in this war and I do not intend to lose any more, I am leaving now. do not stop me, do not find me." At that she turned around, tossed her resignation letter behind her, towards him, and said"I am done with the Argent Crusade."<br/><br/>A few weeks later Devynn was at the Shrine of Two Moons in Pandaria, She had gotten some of her color back and got a new hair color, just in case Adian were to send anyone after her she might not be readily recognized. The WfC had gotten stronger in her absence, and it seemed to have a few more Paladins than before. As she checked in to her small room, she felt for the first time in a long time like she was really and truly home.

His axe glinted in the moonlit night, his muscles tensed as he gripped the handle of his axe tighter, it was still in its loop on his belt, his green skin reflecting the light of the moon, he had been chasing his quarry all over Pandaria and here she was alone in the Karasang woods, It looked like she was lost in thought going over a map of some kind or a letter from this distance he could not tell precisely, but she did match Aidan’s general description of the deserter Devynn. He continued to stalk her from the shadows.<br/><br/>Devynn had been in Pandaria for some time. She was away when Garrosh violated the Vale with the Dark heart of y'shaarj, she returned to find the Vale corrupted by the Sha she had loved this area for its beauty and serenity, now it was tainted and she hoped that the Pandaren could heal this land maybe with some help from both the Horde and the Alliance, as this mess was the fault of both sides. Fighting in Northrend was one thing a common enemy to fight, a purpose to our actions, but here among the cherry blossom trees there was no reason for our hostility to poison this land. As long as Garrosh is warchief there can be no peace. Truer words were never spoken. The hero of Northrend was now a corrupt and merciless dictator. Devynn had joined with Vol ‘Jin and the Darkspear trolls to and fought off the Kor’Kron, alongside other heroes from the Horde, then assisted with the items need to feed and power the revolution, it was an overt act, but desperate times call for desperate measures.<br/><br/>She helped the revolution get off the ground and went back to Pandaria, something about that land just spoke to her, it was a constant pulling a yearning to be in that land of unrivaled beauty.<br/><br/>A few days ago a letter arrived from her sister Briggette. She did not read it right away she was heading off to her favorite spot to just relax and contemplate. Devynn arrived at her spot and took out the letter, Briggette was making headway in her training in Northrend, as a child she was always sneaking around the house and getting caught, but it never deterred her she kept at it so when Briggette got the call to be a spy she jumped at the chance. She was currently on assignment in Dragonblight. As devynn finished reading the letter and put it in her bag, she heard a twig snap, immediately she drew her weapon, and focused all her being into what was to come.<br/><br/>He mumbled a curse under his breath, Damn that !@#$% must have laid out a perimeter warning he thought. She bore the blade that Devynn was purported to use he could see also the faint scar on her right cheek this was the deserter, he would kill her not just for the money, but because now she had made him look like an amateur assassin.<br/><br/>She felt the wind and could smell that something was a off, she remained on her guard deftly crossing out of the opening towards where her alarm was tripped, she smiled a little to herself as she allowed a quick thought to thank Briggette for that little tip. The assassin crept up behind Devynn; unaware that she was leading him upwind he was to focused on getting to her to find the weakness in her armor that he suddenly realized her eyes were locked on his….

The flash of steel, the sound of the dagger missing its intended home and instead striking her on the arm guard of her armor, this Orc is good, she thought, she steeled herself for the conflict just moments ago she had gotten the drop on him but he vanished in the blink of an eye and next thing she knew he was behind her she was barely able to deflect his initial strike, it found its mark but judging by the assassins reaction it was not the lethal strike he had hoped for. the dance of death went on neither combatant gaining an solid upper hand, then the fatal mistake, Devynn did not see that the assassin had backup the whole time. he caught her off guard, and as she parried the Orcs attack, the she felt the sting of a 6 inch blade pierce her in the back, the assailant hit the arm just right and her blade fell to ground. The 2 orcs looked at her as she lay dying on the ground, "What do we do with her? asked the second orc. "Our order are clear, she is to be killed and her head taken back to Adian." Devynn was about to die but she had one last trick up her sleeve, calling on the light of her Paladin training she attempted to heal herself, the fist orc caught this and knocked her unconscious. Devynn was surprised to wake up, she thought for sure she was dead. She woke up to her room in the inn at the Shrine of the Two Moons, there was a female Pandaran tending to her wounds. <br/>"How, how did I get here I should be dead." She said groggily the words a strain to form her jaw hurt like she had been hit by a Vrykul's mace, repeatedly.<br/>"She is awake, I am glad to see you rejoin the living. I understand you have questions, but please you mustnt speak right now, your jaw is still mending and it took all I had to save you and bring you here."<br/>With that Devynn slipped back into unconsciousness.<br/>Over the next few weeks Devynn would continue to slip in and out of it, every time the kindly Pandaren, would tell her to rest, and she would go back to the darkness. <br/>Finally one day Devynn work full of vigor, she felt like her old self again. This time there was no one to greet her as she woke, she looked around and saw her armor had been removed and placed on her armor stand, her sword was there as well, she was soundly confused but at least the pain in her head had finally abated. She weakly climbed out of the bead and made her way to her wash stand, as she splaced the cool and refreshing water on her face she felt something was wrong, immediatly she went to the mirror and saw a new scar, the healer did a remarkable job of healing it but the 6 inch line along her neckline showed her just how close to death she was. She felt all at once relived and at the same time chastised herself for letting herself get caught like that. Never again she vowed. She doned her armor, and found and old piece of armor that would do well covering her scar, as she finished locking in the armor the Pandaren came in softly and said, "Nice to see you are back to your normal self again, your friends from the Coterie called on you while you were out of it. They also mentioned there is always a home for you there. Devynn took a look around her room for the last time, The Wayfarer's Coterie a better bunch of brothers and sisters in arms there wasn't. she asked the Pandaren her name. "It's Sunchin, I was tasked to follow you to keep you safe, the orcs are being held at this location." She handed Devynn a small slip of paper, and with that Devynn clasped her cloak and made her way out, a sly smile crossing over her face under her mask. Im coming for you Adain, she thought to herself as she left the inn.

Somewhere near the Ghostlands, Farstrider retreat. Devynn had the 2 assassins moved her under the cover of darkness, but before she did so she 'convinced' the leader to send a message to Adian that she had managed to elude their trap and that the hunt was still on, she had followed his instructions to leave it at a dead drop near Razor Hill. Out of curiosity she had lingered for a time to see how quickly, and who would retrieve the message. After a few hours a Goblin showed up wearing a plain black uniform, but no markings or colors to signify his loyalties, he was cautious not going directly for the drop, Devynn from her table at the was able to see him but she was hidden from his view. He took the missive, read it after a few moments, crumpled it up and set it ablaze. The goblin quickly left through a portal, presumably back to Adain.<br/><br/>The Orc was furious, Captured! who does this !@#$% think she is, he thought to himself, he also felt embarrassment for not seeing the Pandaren that got the drop on him and his cohort. How long had they been captured it seemed like forever, before Devynn moved them A blood elf had worked both of them over trying to get any kind of information out of them, a missing tusk was a price he paid for not telling his captors what they wanted to hear. the bolt to his cell clicked and the door creaked open.<br/><br/>As a Paladin, Devynn did not condone torture, however this was personal, if she had been able to weeks ago, she probably would have just flat out killed both the orcs for what they did to her, but she was actually glad now that they were her captives, 'Know your enemy, and know yourself' Sunchin had said before Devynn left Pandaria that day,she would do just that. She opened the door to the Orcs prison cell.<br/>She walked in wearing hear mask which was made of Adamantium, with wicked looking spikes surrounding the base of the mask she was also wearing just a plain crimson red robe, and said nothing to the orc, the orc stared back at her bloody face and a half closed eye from a seriously bad black eye. for several minuets they stared at each other neither giving way to this silent battle they were having, finally it was the orc who would speak first.<br/>"Before...."<br/>that was all he could say before a fist took all the air out of his lungs.<br/>"You do not have my permission to speak Orc. I am the one in charge here not you." The orc spat in her face hitting her mask, that was rewarded with another punch to the stomach. as she wiped the bloodied spit from her mask. "you have been a guest for sometime I am surprised you haven't been broken yet. your associate was rather easy to break, maybe a bit to easy", she said as she tossed a bloodied leather chest piece at his feet. He saw the armor and went into a blood rage his friends armor was ragged and torn, and bore the distinct markings of several knife cuts. "you'll get nothing from me, better to kill me now and be done with it." <br/>"Oh no assassin, it will not be that easy, you see I am angry but i am also a Paladin, I am sworn to protect and defend and also my code will allow me to pursue justice as I see fit, no Orc a death sentence is not in your future yet. do you know that I have this gift, to save someone from dying? You see thats why you are still here, if not for me we would not be having this conversion right now, no you would be in some hole in the ground lying next to your friend. So now that that is out of the way, lets have a talk." as she had said she grabbed his index finger and broke it, the Orc screamed. After a time Devynn had all she needed to know, the orc was left alive but was being held captive, true to her word Death was not his judgement that day. She left, with her friend Raenissa in charge of the prisoner. She went to the Wayfarers Coterie guild hall, she was going to need some help......
