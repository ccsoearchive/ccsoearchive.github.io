So me and my guild have been doing a lot of lore searching on Kal'dorei and other aspects of Azeroth and because of that I have re-written/completed Tal's complete history and such!<br/><br/>Talanus Skyfeather<br/>-Age: 4,582<br/><br/>-When/where: Talanus was born and raised in Ashenvale, Kalimdor 3,000 years into the Long Vigil.<br/><br/>-Life before Role(Sentinel): As he grew, Tal' would be in the forest everyday, all day. He always found peace and quite, and especially loved being with the animals. When he become of age, he picked up a bow and started training everyday out in the forest, but he trained alone as all the other Kal'dorei thought him strange for not seeking friendship and some one to grow with. But he preferred it that way. Just him, a bow, and the animals amongst the forests. He also one day rescued a cat, Rak'shiri, from a trap set up by goblins, but as he released her, the goblin himself appeared and took aim to Tal'. But the cat quickly pounced the goblin and ripped him to shreds. The two have never left each others sides since. As he grew older, The Sisters of Elune started taking note of Tal's skills with the bow and commanding Luna. He was an adept at the art of a Hunter. Sentinels' began tasking him with simple little quests such as Killing off animals( Which he hated the most) to maintain population, Killing off Grel, and other corrupted beings. He soon would travel all of Kalimdor do do such minor tasks for them as well. <br/><br/>-Significant events/people: Talanus was in the War of the Shifting Sands under a special Force Team that would infiltrate and destroy, Talanus being the being under the command of Fandral Staghelm, he was one of the groups of people who would scout areas for Silithid, and would also try to find best routes as possible. Here he was able to put his training to good use, becoming more and more skilled with his bow, and even creating a powerful bond with Luna. <br/>Between the long period after the Shifting Sands, Tal spent most of his time scouting out lands the Trolls had taken. It was his job to map there locations, frequently visited places, and at times, take them out. Here he became an adept at using his bow long range, using trees to hide in, while Luna shredded any who came near the tress they had "Taken up". <br/>He was also requested help from the Sentinels at the Battle for Mount Hyjal (Warcraft 3, not the newest one from cata) where he witnessed the destruction of both Arichimonde and Nordrassil. . After words he was sent to the new world tree, Teldrassil, when it was created to help fend off the corrupted animals, demons and people. He Also has a main home there now as well, though he ever spends time in it. He next was once again requested by the Sentinels for his skills in the eradication of the Blue dragon flight in Norhtrend. <br/><br/>When it comes to people, again Tal' hardly had friends for he chose to stick to himself. He felt he trained better when it was only him and Luna, only when he was placed within groups during wars did he make friends, but they always ended up dying. Because of that, he decided to Isolate himself even more, not wanting to cause more pain and death to those around him.Tal did find a girl once. Lanoura Moonshade. It was during the fight for Hyjal where he had been an outrunner for the Sentinels. She was a huntress for the Sentinels, and they took a liking to each other. Even their companions got along well. When they had some time off during the war they would escape out and up deep into the mountains where they spent time together. But has fate would have it, during the final fight for Hyjal, the two were separated during battle, only to find her after battle with an orcish arrow lodged into her chest. He brought her bodie back to the base camp and gave her a proper burial. This made him Isolate himself even further, only communicating with others when in need of supplies.

-What led to your path (Sentinel) : Over centuries and centuries of training as a Hunter along with his companion, Luna, Tal' wished to do more but petty quests for others. His true desire was to protect the pure, to protect nature and it's beasts, and to most of all thwart those who sought to destroy it.Since then it was his a goal of his to join the ranks of Sentinels. <br/><br/>-Significant event for it?:After the War of the Shifting Sands, Tal' was placed in a task force with two others he soon befriended. They would scout lands for any trolls and other Horde members. His specialty being Tracking and deadly accuracy with a bow, his skills were crucial for this team. One night while running atop the trees, they had been spotted by a large group of Trolls who were traveling. The three battled troll after troll, trying to my haste to escape, but it was becoming to much and they were running out of time. Tal' quickly whistled out for his companion whom he had left at base camp. He has such a powerful bond with her that when he whistles out, he can speak to her directly, mind to mind. But it was almost too late. As he battled, he heard the other two fall and cry for help, he quickly laid arrow after arrow into his foes, but heard no more of their cries. He then felt two arrows puncture his skin and dive deep into his body. One in his back, the other through his shoulder. It was too much, he fell too his knees, and the last he saw was Luna dashing in, tearing up the remaining Horde. He fainted soon after. When he did awake, He had found himself in a Cenarion Circle refugee with few Sentinel Officers. They asked him for the report, and he gave it to them. After his wounds where healed, he found himself at yet another Burial ceremony. Soon after words, Tal' was asked to become a full member of the Sentinels and not just a 'paper boy'. He joined their ranks as an outrunner, but he did not join for himself, he joined to protect nature, to save those in the future who would need help. <br/>After once again proving his skill and bravery in the battle of Hyjal, he was awarded the rank of Sentinel, which meant nothing to him without Lanoura beside him.<br/>-Developement/Teacher: Talanus was all self taught. He had to teach himself everything due to his isolatism him as he grew up. But if he did have a teacher per say, it was Lanoura, they always helped each other, gave tips to each other, to better in their art. But he always found his true teacher to be nature. It guided his arrow, his string as it flung, everything he did he believed was due to nature, that he would be nothing without the whispers of the wind, the teachings of the trees. <br/><br/>-Hardships: Once again, due to Talanus Isolation, he never had true friends, and when he did, they always died. Even the one he wished to become his mate had been killed before him. And after her, did never bring another thought of finding a new mate. <br/>Also, Talanus found many hardships in dealing with other Races. He once met a Human and a Dwarf during his travels. They seemed friendly, and so they traveled together for a little while. But it was a set up. They asked Tal' for beautiful sights of the Forests, but when Talanus showed them such, they quickly dispersed the trees into fire. Destroying much of the Forest. Heart Stricken that he had helped others in the destruction of his sacred land, Tal' never trusts any other race he meets that is Kal'dorei. He believes the other younger races are to easily corrupted. Nor does he begin to friend them until they prove themselves pure and trustworthy. This once again led to him being alone with only Luna by his side. But she is all he ever needs know. <br/><br/>-Events: War of the Shifting Sands, Battle for Mount Hyjal(past), and helped cure Teldrassil until it was blessed. Helped with the invasion of Northrend<br/><br/>-Hopes: Talanus hopes to create a name for himself throughout his people. He no longer wishes or their dissaproval or isolationism. <br/><br/>-Drives?: What drives Talanus is the hope of cleansing Azeroth, and to fight for the one he had finally found, but loss, Lanoura. He also is fights for the ones who no longer can fight, for the fallen.<br/><br/>-Goals?: Tal' seeks to become the most skilled Hunter amongst Azeroth. He wishes to be fully tuned with all animals and nature. He also seeks to become a Warden so he may further help stop the corrupted, and restore peace and order. <br/><br/>-Fears: Talanus's only fear is that of losing, of finally dying. For that he rushes full head forward, to face the fear, to become what many have doubted him of. He only seeks to purify and restore peace to Azeroth before his body and soul is claimed to the Dream World<br/><br/>-rest of Life: Talanus wants to spend the rest of his life amongst nature, being a sage to his people, and a trainer to new hunters. He wants to become the guide to the world, the voice for the young.

And here is a quick story on how I obtained Luna my companion <br/><br/>So there I was. A profound young Night Elf with great skill in Bows. But that's all I was. By now many of the other hunters had tamed there first companion, always showing them off, ignorant to the fact that their companion is more then just a fashion statement. We are Elves of the Forest, Beauty roams inside through us from nature and granted to us by the gods. Animals are as such as well. Oh well, what can I do about it. Their ignorance is only a flame that will grow stronger untill it proceeds to consume them one day. For instance I was told of a story of a brave hunter amongst our people, but he died because of one fact, he did not earn the respect of his companion, he only used it for its beauty. Nature is more philosophical then what it shows us. Well anyways, where was I..Ah yes, so there I was, starring out into my village for what would probably be the last time I would see this part of Ashenvale. I had just received a letter from a priestess asking for me to check up on the Northern part of Wintergrasp. The reason for my dismay is they had sent a few other of our Kal'dorei to the same location, but have yet to return within a full cycle of the moon. I guess a couple of our own dead doesn't mean anything to anyone yet. Oh well, Let Malorne guide the path that is set for me. Tomorrow I take my leave to this 'Wintergrasp'.<br/> The travel was not that bad. It was peacefull being alone with just nature and the wondrous amounts of animals that occupied it. I would stop ever so often to find a pack of cats or owls. Always looking food they are. This i why I always keep a bag full of treats. It is filled with meats, grains, and anything else the gods provide us with, so either way the animals always got what they liked. But anyways back to the trip now. Now with every adventure there is always danger, and only being one thousand four hundred and eighty three, I had encountered many different dangers from thieves, trolls, and at times the animals. I did well to never harm them, I had found my self of finding their weakness, exposing it, and then making peace with them. An example I can offer is at one time in Darkshore I had encountered a DuskSaber. It was angry, roaring in furiousity, But I did what came natural to me. I dodged it' attacks, first looking to find why it was attacking me, which is usually there weakness. It turned out that it's cubs where up the trees next to me, and the mother only seeked to protect them. I quickly used the ancient Elven ability to meld myself into the surroundings, some call it 'Shadowmeld'. Then I sat in the same spot as to not give away my position, Sabers have a great sense of smell, but we Elves smell like our surroundings we live in, but a slight move sends our hormones through out our bodies, which is what the Sabers smell for to track us. Yes it took time and Studies to figure this one out. But as I sat the mother began to grow calm, and went back to trying to get her cubs down. but she was still big and round from having them, her weight was too much to carry up so she continued slipping down the tree. I waited for the right moment, and when it came, I struck. Of course if you have been listening you would know I am not one to harm what nature makes, so what I did was hug onto her neck, using my hands to quickly find her pressure point. Within seconds after I found it and squeezed it the mother Saber had collapsed onto the floor into a deep dream. I then climbed the trees, bringing each cub down carefully as I could. I sat them next to their mother of course so they could drink the milk she provided from her body as she slept. I waited for the next couple of minutes for the mother to wake. This is the most crucial part, for the cubs become very vulnerable to predators when the mother is asleep, so it was my duty to watch them. The mother finally sprung life into her eyes as she awoke, the cubs overjoyed that they could now tug on her ears playfully. She glanced over to me as I continued sitting eating bread the priestesses had provided me or my trip. I locked eyes with her, feeling her emotions, sensing her thoughts. What she had to say was simple. <br/>"Thank you." But a thanks was not necessary, It is my job as a Kal'dorei to protect Nature and those who thrive peacefully upon it. I got up, slowly walking towards her, giving her a soft pat on her head saying,<br/>" Be safe, teach them the ways to protect not only themselves, but you as well great beast of the wild."

So my journey continued until I knew I was finally in Wintergrasp. It was pretty obvious. An abundance of snow everywhere. Plus on the map a Sentinel had provided me it had a marking with Kal'dorei words, clearly translating to," You know when you have arrived amongst the land of Wintergrasp when the air becomes frozen, and there is a !@#$ load of snow everywhere." Sentinels sure had a way with words.... Getting to the final destination was not hard at all, few clicks this way, then another ew clicks this way, and before you know it, there was the problem. Little green disgusting men and women, no larger then a about Two feet. The air here was not frozen, it was polluted, and it disgusted me that these foul beings would tamper with the land of the gods and destroy it with their filthy machines. There was not a lot of them though, only a handful, I kept thinking to myself this should be easy, but nothing ever is unless you are prepared. So that is what I did, I traveled up the nearest mountain, still in view of their machines that darkened the sky. But as I climbed I began hearing the wind slowly talk to me, it was crying, but yet roaring in anger. I rushed to where the wind was creating this devastating sound, but when I got there I almost fell to my knees. It was a slaughter. Blood, fur, trap after trap. It seemed that these greenish gnomes, which I recalled reading about them in an old book, goblins. Yes, this is what they were, a creation from the Fel in my books, and what I saw here only led to my wanting of there destruction even greater, but there it was again, the crying roar of anger. I searched amongst the body parts of the animals who had been trapped amongst these death grips of horror and disgust. But the wind was telling me to search father back into the trees, and that is where I had found her. A cat of great honor. The sketches I had seen were no match to to naturalistic beauty. The gods had truly carved this being with their own hands, the great Rak'Shiri. But I wasn't going to let ignorance defile my character as it had the others back at home. My priority was saving this beast. I raced to her as quick as I could, and as I did I began searchin in my bags for a sedative created by the priestesses that ceased pain for a while. When I reacherd her, and yes it was a her, her hormones of estrogen where where being pumped at a high level due to the pain she was in. The Kal'dorei smell was ten times greater then the average human, so smelling her aura was easy then it seemed. I will admit, trying to get a cat to swallow a vial of sedative was hard when she is constantly trying to tear at your face. , but it was understandable, she was unsure if I were friend or foe yet.

Doing a presuure point wasn't going to work as well especially with her moving about. Slo I did the next natural thing I could, I grabbed a piece of meat out of my bag and poured the sedative onto it, letting it seep into it. I then tossed the meat to her, where she quickly devoured it, must've thought it was me or else I have no other reason why it quickly ate it. Then the next part was hard, I had to wait for the sedative to snap into action, which only takes 12 seconds per 60 pounds of mass. So all together it only took about 20 seconds. She became calm, unaware of what was happening. Carefully I crept up to her with my hand held out so she may see that I was not there too harm her. That is when my bond whent into place, our eyes locked, and then the wind whispered between us, her emotions so calm as she whispered,<br/>" Please, help me, I do not wish to become that of my brothers and sisters." I nodded whispering next to her as I knelt down to the foot trap where I saw it had completely broken her leg,<br/>" Everything will be ok, I will not let anything happen to you, Just don't move and stay clam and I will do my best Great Beast". I starred at the trap for a second, the release rod had jammed itself into her leg where the compound fracture took place. There was only one way I would be able to release it now. I grabbed each side of the Jaw like device, and whispered slowly to myself,<br/>" Please great Gods lend me strength to release your making back into the wild", This was not entirely needed, but I did it to re-assure the beast I would do my best. I then began to ull the jaw of the trap apart using all my strength, but being carefully as to not move her foot. Within seconds the rod slipped out and the trap released. She quickly went lip where I then held the upper part of her leg up,<br/>" Please stand still, I will fix this for you, but healing will take some time ". She nodded in reply. I let go of her leg for a second, where she knew to keep holding it up. I reached into my back for my long piece of clothe I always used to patch up holes on my clothing. Once I got the right length I ripped it with my teeth, then grabbed a few pieces of cotton, pouring a sedative which cleaned out wounds.<br/>"Ok, this is going to hurt a lot, even with the sedative I gave you earlier". I grabbed her leg with both my hands, blood rushing onto the bottom hand like the great river in Hyjal. I quickly squeezed and pushed the two bones back into place. Her roar could be heard throughout the valley, I must hurry before those defiling creatures would come to check on the noise. I wrapped her leg up, putting the sedative cottons against the open wound, then wrapped the cloth around it, where I tied it tightly so it wouldn't loosen.<br/> "will you be able to walk without it for a few days?" I asked her. Of course her reply was<br/> "Yes, I will stand the pain.<br/>" It saddened me to see the look on her face as she turned around to make her leave.<br/> "Would you like my protection for a little while?" I asked. <br/>"No, I must travel back to my cave, a place my kind likes no one knowing about<br/>." Completely understandable I thought to myself.<br/> "I pray to ELune to keep you safe great beast". <br/>"And to you as well Elf"<br/> I turned around, unaware of the footsteps being made in the snow back behind the trees until I head the subtle click of what must've been a gun. How foolish of me to have stopped paying attention to my surroundings. I looked behind me once more to make sure that the Rak'shiri had made a good distance, but she was now where to be seen. Good I thought, she must've gotten good distance fast. As I turned back around the green vile little goblin had made himself visible, moving away from behind the tree, his rifle pointing at me. I remained calmed. If this is what the Gods had planned for my death then so be it.

"You let go our precious food giant"<br/>"No, I have saved a peaceful being of these lands, it is you who have intruded, polluting my Gods' heaven by your presence and you machines."<br/>"Big words for one who is about to meet these so called gods face to face!" It shrieked. It brought the gun up to full firing position. Little Fel, It should know to always have you weapon ready. But I sat there, unable to do anything because I had not picked up my bow from helping the Cat. Oh well, last mistake I would ever make. <br/> The Gods have a funny way of making things work, for as the goblin pulled the trigger, His own rifle blew up on him. I smirked, but before I could reach for my Bow I heard a roar, a roar of passion leap from the heavens, from the dream realm. It was the Rak'shiri. She pounced on the goblin, ripping him to shreds. But as she finished she began to wince. A soft cry. She had taken a lot of pain from her leg to help me, and for that I was very grateful.<br/>"Thank you great beast, I am in your debt for saving me," I said honorably.<br/>"No, it was I who was in your debt, but it seems we are an equal grounds now Elf."<br/>"I suppose we are," I smiled. "But please, I insist you stay by my side until you are fully healed, I do not wish to see your death be added to those of the innocent."<br/>"Well if you keep pushing for my presence then I shall Elf, you seem an honorable one at the least"We climbed up higher into the mountains finding a cave that had been uninhibited for quite some time. We spent almost a full moon cycle up there where I would come out every day to gather food for us. She slept a lot, and I mean a LOT. But it was good for her, sleep will quicken the healing process as my mother had always told me. But the day had finally come, I unwrapped the bandage, showing her her foot to satisfy her. <br/>"It seems you know quite a lot dear Elf," she whispered to me<br/>"Yes I must, it is important to when all alone." She seemed shock to hear of this.<br/>"I have never known of an Elf without it's growing partner or trainer?"<br/>"Well I prefer it this way, I do not wish to bring harm or see death of others as I grow, besides, I like the peace."<br/>"Well, you truly are an interesting one. But you have done more then saved me Elf, so I am still in your debt, and I believe I know why you are here, in search of your kind isn't it?" She said<br/>"Yes, they have not yet to return to my village, I was tasked to see what has happened, but I stumbled upon the Goblins instead."<br/>"Then There is your answer, they lay trapped in cages by the Goblins' machines."<br/>"Then that is where I head, please do be safe while I am gone great beast, and if you choose to leave while I am away, then may Elune keep you safe in the path Malorne has provided you with," I said to her in a polite manner.<br/>"You silly being, as I said, I am still in your debt for saving me and being with me as I healed"<br/>"But you have already saved me in return," I said contently<br/>"No, that was simple, I'm sure you would've reached your bow in time before he found another way to strike you down. I shall go and help you."<br/>I knew she was going to continue being persistent so I just nodded. I was afraid she would get hurt again, I wouldn't allow that to happen. We traveled down the mountain when we began seeing the reckless machines in view, we stopped behind a large cedar to prepare when she turned to me<br/>"You are a hunter are you not? You wield a bow," she asked<br/>"Yes I am."<br/>"where is your companion then? this would make things easier."<br/>"I do not have one. I have not yet found a being to respect and trusts and entrust my life upon when need be, though many honorable animals I have crossed paths with," I replied. <br/>"Well then, Seeing how I am in your Debt for saving me. I fully trust you Elf. you are honorable, kind, and compassionate to nature. Your Gods have a very honorable Kal'dorei amonsgt them."<br/>"No, I have made plenty of mistakes of my own. And besides, you are a graceful being, I am the one honored to be in your presence."<br/>She laughed a little," Elf, I trust you with my life, my soul, and my emotions. As much as you make it seem to be an honor to be in my presence, I would be more honored if you placed your trust, respect, and emotions unto me." She was sure of what she was saying. She showed no sign of hesitation.<br/>I linked eye to eye with her," I, Talanus Skyfeather, Wish for you, great Rak'shiri, to become my entrusted companion, my friend, and my protector. As well I promise to guide, to help, to protect you until death." And it was at that moment I felt a bond as strong as the winds itself. My life's duty was now hers, as well as hers mine. <br/>"Then let us eradicate this corruption Talanus, friend, for you may call me Luna, as others have called me."<br/><br/>And that was the start of the most powerful bond between Tal' and Luna. Hope you all enjoyed!
