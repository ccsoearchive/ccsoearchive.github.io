The unobtrusive, and wholy un-noteworthy little Gnome shyly made his way down the very edge of the road toward the massive notice board in the Trade District of Stormwind. Clutching tightly to a rumpled little piece of paper in his tiny hands, he looked around at the masses of people, looking slightly uneasy. Anyone who would have taken notice at all, would have seen the fear play across his bright green eyes. And would be able to tell before too long, that this particular little Gnome was not used to being around people, let alone a crowded street. <br/><br/>He looked down, almost hopefully at the note in his hands as he now stood at the massive sign. His hands shook ever so slightly as he tried in vain to smooth out the little piece of paper, and reached for a pin stuck in the board. Then ever so gently, he pinned his message to the lower left hand corner of the sign.<br/><br/>He hesitated a moment as he re-read what he had written in his barely ledgible print. Then, with a quick look around, he turned quickly, and ran down the street out of the overwhelming city. <br/><br/>The little rumpled piece of paper read as follows: <br/>"To whom it may concern: <br/>My name is Gnojin. And I am with out home or hearth.<br/>I am seeking refuge with other Gnomes, who I am told, are aligned with the Alliance forces. <br/>I was Orphaned some time ago, and do not know where I belong. As an infant, I was found and cared for by a Troll hunter named Datso. I did not, until recently, know why he kept me hidden from the other Trolls. I found that my kind are not part of the Horde, and by decree of the War Chief Himself, my kind are to be killed on sight! <br/><br/>I've wandered lost and alone for many years now. Not knowing where I belong.<br/>A Pandaren Monk I shared my journies with for a short time, told me I should seek out my kind here, in the Alliance.<br/><br/>Sincerely, Gnojin<br/><br/>P.S: You can usually find me when I'm least expecting it."

(Prequell to "Shy Little Gnome")<br/><br/>The air was fettid with the smells of blood and smoke. The Troll's eyes burned as he strained for sight through the thick haze. The string of his bow was now broke after the long rain of arrows he had let set sail into the Alliance forces. His fingers burned from where the string had snapped on his last release. <br/><br/>Suddenly he caught the sound of a child's crying pearcing the silence. His ears stood straight up as he honed in on the direction of the sobbing. Then his eyes grew wide as the realization struck him that the cries came from no Horde youngling. He thaught "What fool of an Alliance dog would bring a child to the battlefield?" <br/><br/>He sniffed the air.<br/>Gnome!<br/>There had been no Gnomes in this battle! He was sure of it!<br/><br/>Datso's feet made very little noise as he made his way quickly in the direction of the sounds of the child. He drew his dagger from the back of his belt as he neared the noise. He was sworn to his duty, No Alliance left standing. <br/><br/>The crying was suddenly replaced with the sounds of soft giggling. And as the breeze cut a slice out of the smoke, the Troll could see the child sitting with his back turned to him. That was good. Better to kill it without looking in it's eyes. <br/><br/>The Gnomeling giggled again sweetly. The Troll stopped short, and saw what had caught the gnomelings amusement. It was a small raptor hatchling. But the raptor noticed the Troll and looked up at him. This made the Gnome child stop and turn with curiosity. The tiny child froze, his hand on the raptors head, green eyes going wide in terror at the sight of the Troll with the dagger half raised. Tears filled his eyes, and his lower lip started to quiver, but no sound escaped him. <br/><br/>Suddenly, Datso dropped the dagger into the dust at his feet as he noticed the pair of bodies not far away. Gnomes. Both laying dead with arrow shafts in them that the Troll recognized right away. They were his own...<br/>Simple travelers. Innocents caught in the crossfire. <br/><br/>He looked back to the child still frozen in terror. And for the first time in his life, he felt regret in his killing of Alliance citizens. He felt every bit the "monster" the Alliance accused him of being.<br/><br/>He looked down as the damaged bow. He raised it in both clawed hands high above his head, and brought it down sharply across his knee, shattering in into pieces. Then ever so slowly, he reached out and picked up the trembling, blue haired Gnomeling, and held it facing him.<br/>A tiny hand reached out and touched his face, and came back wet. The Troll had never shed a tear on the battlefield before. Not once. Not ever. Not until now...<br/><br/>He pulled the child close to him, as if to hide him from prying eyes. But those still left alive were far too buisy scavaging for what treasured they could find on the bodies that riddled the field. Datso took this chance to slip to the dark security of the trees nearby with his little bundle. <br/><br/>Quickly he made his way up a secret path into the Stonetalon Mountains. Ever keeping a watchful eye for those that might see him with the Gnomeling clutched in his arms. And after a days journey, the unlikely pair made their way to a little hut hidden in the cliffside over looking the seas below. <br/><br/>He set the child down and appraised him. Sturdy little thing, if not slightly fragile.<br/>"I be Datso'jin, but what we be callin' you?"<br/>The Gnomeling looked at him blankly, not knowing what the large Troll was saying.<br/>"You be a Gnome. Dat fo' sure. But I be makin' ya a 'jin before too long. So, I be callin' ya Gno'jin!" And with that the Troll let out a jovial laugh. And the small child smiled up at him sweetly.

Gno'jin grew up, forgetting a child's memmory of war and death.<br/>He grew up happily, not only learning the wild ways of the mountains and fields, but also learning to love a Troll as his own father. <br/><br/>Over the years, it had become impossible to keep the Gnome a secret. Datso'jin's clan learned of his orphan child. And though they did not approve of the situation, they were blood-bonded to protect their own, even from the War Chief Him self.<br/>----------------------------------------------<br/><br/>War once again raised it's ugly fist, and this time it slammed right down on the heart of Stonetalon. They had to leave. They were nolonger safe in their cliffside haven.<br/>They packed quickly, and stole away in the night. Making their way toward the reletive safety of the Northern Barrens. And though the war was falling ever further behind them, the true danger was looming ever closer as they neared the Orc Homelands.<br/><br/>Just before breaking from the dark safety of the trees, a squadron of Orcs and Trolls crossed their path.<br/><br/>Gno'jin was small enough to go un-noticed in the thick underbrush. But Datso was far to tall to hide. And he was seen immediately.<br/>"Datso'jin!" the Orc Captain bellowed, "It's been a long time! We thaught you dead!"<br/>The Orc's eyes brightened. "You come with us, your bow is needed!"<br/><br/>He had no choice, he had to go or risk the discovery of his Gnome son.<br/><br/>Gno'jin knew to keep quiet. He ever so quietly edged his way deeper into the underbrush. He would have to wait until the small army had made it's way down the road. Taking with them his only family. His only friend. <br/><br/>What would he do, and where would he go?<br/><br/>((OOC: I hope you liked this short intro into the past of Gnojin. His story will be ever evolving, and I hope there are some of you who would like to take this journey with him.))

"Memories" <br/><br/>He sat huddled under a bush just outside the Gates of the Alliance city. His knees drawn up under his chin with his arms wrapped tightly around his legs. He trembled from the adreniline that coursed through him from his venture through those gates.<br/><br/>He closed his eyes and let his mind wander back over the years. Back to the days that followed his separation from his father, there at the edge of the Barrens.<br/><br/>He had watched as the war band made it's way down the road. Taking his father with it. He saw clearly in his memory the look of sadness on Datso'jin's face as he looked back over his shoulder toward where the little Gnome sat hidden. Tears stealing their way into his eyes. He had half raised one claw hand in Gno'jin's direction, as if trying to hold on.<br/><br/>Night came before the gnome ventured from his hiding place. He looked at the plains before him, and knew he must move across them with all due care. No walking the well traveled roads, no, he must make his way secretly. <br/>He traveled all night and day. And as darkness drew, he found himself hiding amongst the rocks outside the walls of Orgrimmar. His father had told him of this place. It was the home of the War Chief. The same War Chief who's army had taken his father from him.<br/>Sheading his fear for a moment, he stood, angry tears in his eyes, he launched a rock at the wall. It bounced off harmlessly, but the noise it made startled the near by grunts. And in the darkness they looked about for the cause of the disruption. Gno'jin knew immediately his mistake, and quickly scrambled through the rocks, away from the Horde Capitol. This was no place for him.<br/><br/>He made his way down the banks of a lazy river, with nothing but the clothes on his back and his father's spear. And over the coming days, these became nothing but tatters. But he knew how to hunt, and he learned how to fight with his feet and hands, as the wild game saught him out as a meal. He fashioned simple armor from their hides as he turned them into what they so wanted him to be. And he would have been quite the sight had anyone taken note of him. A little dusty Gnome, feathers in his hair, crocolisk teeth, beads and leather straps across his chest and feet. Raptor claws and hide on his shoulders and hands. And to those not paying attention, he would seem just another Troll youngling.

The river began to widen after many days journey. And he came to the great sea, and a small town where people of all races milled about. Goblins, it seemed ran the place. And he could go un-noticed. Here he heard talk of Trolls in a far off land that were not, in fact, part of the Horde. And he thought to himself that perhaps they would welcome him into their tribes. He learned that the ships that came to and from this town went to that far off place, and he soon found himself stowed away on one of the vessels.<br/><br/>The trip was arduous, but soon the ship made it's way to the port of yet another Goblin town.<br/>This one was on the southern borders of a great jungle. "Booty Bay", the locals called this new town. And for a small place, it was very buisy. Too buisy for a shy little Gnome.<br/>He left the little town and made his way north, through the thick jungle. Along the way, he saw new plants and flowers he could never before immagine. They fascinated him, and he began to collect them, placing them in the little pack he had made from one of his many hunting kills. But ever on his mind were these new Trolls, and so he kept searching.<br/>One day while he was admiring his newest addition to his collection, a little plant that oddly enough reminded him of the hair that grew thick on his cheeks, he heard drums start to beat in the distance. He stuffed the small plant into his pouch and made his way quickly in the direction of the drums, and soon heard chanting as well. As he came closer to the noise, he crept quietly until he reached the edge of the Troll village. But what he saw made his blood run cold.<br/><br/>The Trolls were gathered around a large stone slab, chanting and dancing about. There was a body tied to the stone, but it nolonger moved. Gno'jin knew this was a ritual sacrifice cerimony. And the small body that lay there motionless was that of a Gnome. The blood seemed to drain from him as he turned and fled in terror, back toward the safety of that small town on the southern banks of this now horrible jungle.<br/>It took days to get to the town, and he rarely stopped along the way. He was tired, scratched, battered and bruised by the time he was able to make his way to the docked ship. The vessel that would take him back to lands he knew, lands he called home.

When the ship ported, he made his way first East, then he turned North toward the forest his father had taken him hunting. Ashenvale. All along the way he collected his little plants and flowers. This made him happy, brought some small joy into his world that had been turned up side down over the past months.<br/><br/>He stayed hidden away, deep in the thickest parts of the forest. Away from the peoples of the world who always seemed to be fighting. And he could not bring himself to understand how they could stay angry for so long. Nor over what it was they were fighting for.<br/><br/>There came a day when an odd sort of being was crossing through this land. The likes of which Gno'jin had never seen. It appeared to be some sort of large bear. But it walked upright, and wore leather clothes and a dish upon it's head. Gno'jin hid, and watched the stranger as it took a seat on a fallen tree to have a meal.<br/>"Come out from hiding little one." Came the deep, yet wholy calm voice. And Gno'jin felt himself start in his suprise. After a short pause, he climbed from the bushes, and oh so carefully stepped into the Clearing. The song of the forest played it's soft tune of birds singing, wind through the leaves, and the water of the streams softly trickling.<br/>The Bear thing looked at the little feather covered Gnome, and gave a chuckle.<br/>"The world has many suprises little Gnome. But you, you are the most curious of them all."<br/>Gno'jin, filled with relief at the kindness in the stranger's voice, and overcome with the great sadness that comes from many years of loneliness, ran to the great bear. With uncontrolable tears streaming down the dirt on his face, he threw his arms around the strangers leg, and clung to him, and cried...

The Pandaren placed his immense paw on the little Gnome's head and gently stroked his matted blue hair. He waited until the sobs became sniffles, then said, "The smallest drop of water can become the greatest of floods. But once the storm has passed, new life may grow."<br/><br/>THe Gnome looked up into the eyes of this being, searching for answers to all his questions. There was wisdom in those brown eyes. But something told Gno'jin the answers would only come over time.<br/>"What are you?" was the only question that seemed to matter at the moment to him.<br/>"I am Taosung, and I am Pandaren.", the Bear said in reply, "Come sit with me. What has brought you to such sorrow?"<br/>Gno'jin sat on the fallen tree next to the Pandaren, and told his tale.<br/><br/>After the Gnome had finished, Taosung seemed to ponder it briefly, then said: "I believe the ancestor's would have you travel with me for a while. Perhaps you will find your true path along our way."<br/>Gno'jin didn't know why exactly, but he accepted this proposal with out question. As if it were simply supposed to happen just this way.<br/>And so, his lessons began, with out him even knowing.<br/>"Gather that which you would take with you, and let us be on our way." Taosung said in his deep, calm voice. "Let the road before us, take us where it will."<br/><br/>Over the months that followed they passed through many lands. Some wild and green, others covered in snow, and yet still others that seemed to cry out in pain. Always there was something new to see, something new to learn. Taosung taught the Gnome how to write in what he called "common", so that Gno'jin might make notes of the things he saw or learned. And thus, not knowing the break in his name, became Gnojin.<br/>He taught him how to completely clear his mind and remain absolutely still. And in this meditative state, he could see and sence the easily missed things in the world around him.<br/>Gnojin learned that in these calm states he could sence a ribbon of energy. It ran through everything around him. And even through himself as well. Everything was connected.<br/>Taosung taught him how to channel that energy. With it he could heal himself, and even those around him. But he also learned that it could be focused and consentrated into very distructive ways, enabling him to protect himself and those around him. The Pandaren also taught him the finer arts of hand to hand combat, for when it was neccessary.

In their travels, they would often come across small villages and towns. However Gnojin would hang back, and wait for the Pandaren to finish whatever buisness he had in them, then return to him, and they would start their journey once again. And Taosung never seemed to push the shy Gnome to enter these places.<br/><br/>The day that was inevitable finally came. The day of partings.<br/>They had come to a river, and on the far side the forest seemed to be brighter, greener, happier.<br/>"Now my friend, it is time." Taosung sounded as if he were about to start another lesson.<br/>"Time for what, Tao?" Gnojin asked with his usual curiosity.<br/>The Pandaren looked down at the Gnome, "Time for you to find your true path."<br/>"Through the wood on the far side of this river stands a mighty city. There you will find your people, the Gnomes."<br/>Wonderment flooded through Gnojin and it showed in his eyes.<br/>"There will be other races there as well. Humans, Dwarves, and others. Be not overly afraid of them, they will not readily harm you." Gnojin could sence that the Pandaren was not going to be coming with him. "Will I ever see you again?" He asked as trears once again filled his eyes.<br/>"Perhaps someday. But now, dry your eyes, and be happy for the time we have shared." Taosung replied in his usual calm and wise manner. "I must soon return to my own homelands. But time is a friend, not an enemy, and should it be the will of the ancestor's, then yes, we shall cross paths once again."<br/>Gnojin gave his friend a hug in farewell. "Before I go, little one, I give you one more small piece of advice. I have friends that tell me of a great sign in that city. One where the people display things on their minds. Make yourself one of these notes and post it there should you find yourself too frightened to stay in the city long. Other's will see it, and perhaps help, or even join you along your way."<br/>The Gnome thaught this over for a moment, "I will." he replied. "I'll miss you Tao. Safe journey." And with that the Pandaren turned and vanished through the trees.<br/><br/>Gnojin rummaged through his pack for a piece of coal and paper. He quickly wrote his note on the rumpled paper, then made his way across the stones in the river bead. Quietly made his way to the gates of the Great City...<br/><br/>He opened his eyes. How long had he been hiding under this bush he wondered.<br/>The air was cooling and the day was growing dim. He had stopped shivering. And though he was still somewhat frightened, his curiosity was far stronger. He carefully made his way out of his protective little bush. Ever keeping an eye on the road into the city, and it's travelers.<br/>Then cauciously, he slipped back through the gates...

He made his way across the bridge once again. Staying very close to it's edge so as to not be run over or trampled by the travelers coming and going from the great city.<br/><br/>He let himself marvel at the sights as he went. His first trip into this buisy place was for the sole purpose of making it to the sign board. This time however, his curious nature was getting the best of him. And he gaped and smiled at all the new things to see. No one was paying much attention to him, and this relieved him, and some of his tension. <br/><br/>The buildings were what amazed him most. Their pristine white walls and sloped roofs were of the likes he had never seen before. He wondered how they were made, and who made them. It must have taken a long time to build such structures. <br/><br/>The children running and playing also amazed him. They were taller than he was, yet still just out of infancy. Thier laughter made him chuckle, it was infectious. He found himself wanting to play with them, yet still to afraid to say anything. <br/><br/>Taosung had been right. There were races beyond what he could immagine here. The tall ones he learned were the Great Elves, the short stout ones were Dwarves, and the ones most populative were the Humans. Then there were the curious ones with hooves, He found they were called Draenie, and were not of this world. Then he caught sight of something that made him clutch tightly to the staff that Tao had given him. They looked to be large savage wolves. And they frightened him. They were once Human he heard, but had been cursed and were now called Worgen. They all facinated him.<br/>But what braught the brightest smile to his face were the tiny folk of his size. The Gnomes. <br/><br/>He could make out the words spoken in common, but many spoke other languages, and these he could not understand. But he listened anyway. He found the sounds to be quite intrigueing.

There were some red shiny fruits on the ground that he collected and placed in his pack for his meal later.<br/><br/>The city was so very buisy. He was happy when he finally found a quiet spot.
