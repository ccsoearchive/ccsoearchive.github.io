Why, oh why did I hesitate before becoming truly alarmed about her absence. What kind of husband am I? Have I failed her? Light please don't let that be true!<br/><br/>I remember Auxi offering to look for her. Was I wrong in denying anything was wrong? Perhaps I should take her up on her kind offer, and see if Mia is just off busy doing Blood Knight business, or if something notorious has happened? <br/><br/>I need to get a hold of myself. I'm almost definitely sure that she been so busy. Have I somehow become Kel'Tira in our relationship to her Nicias? No, I won't accept that. We won't allow that to happen? Will we? Omigod...I miss her so...<br/><br/>I know Mia would forbid it, but should I talk to Kel concerning this? I mean she lives this on a daily basis, and as much as I hate that, maybe she can tell me how she copes with the absence, the long nights, the loss of contact...would she open up to me or would she resent it? <br/><br/>Am I panicking? Yes, that's what it is, panic. I need to breathe, to think about it, and believe everything is alright. I'll try to contact her via the guildstone first. Yeah, that's it.<br/><br/>Whew, it's never good to let your mind race off in a panic. It can think of so many scary actions and occurances that may or can happen.<br/><br/>Should I check the infirmary? Maybe she came in when I didn't know it! Reign it in Cyaer!!! Get a grip, man!!!!

<em>A leather bound book, with the symbol of harmony embossed on the cover:</em><br/><br/>My skills in healing have improved to the point where I can resusitate a fallen comrade if the need arises. And I have gone on several expeditions into dungeons known throughout the area. I am feeling more confident in my healing, and that is a good thing.<br/><br/>In my journeys I have learned to ride my trusty turtle. She moves faster than I thought she would, which aids me getting from one place to the next much quicker than my ambling run does. I feel a kinship to her...I cannot say why I feel close to her, I just do. Probably the lonliness of working out here in such a barren area. They named this area appropriately.<br/><br/>I still feel a kindred spirit with the taurens I have met here in the Crossroads. Perhaps travelling to their main city would be enlightening. Yes, I must make plans to go there, Mulgore I believe...to Thunder Bluffs or something like that. I am still trying to learn the language, and to maintain some sort of inner peace as I go about my work and business. Somedays are better than others.

The sea rolled below as the netherdrake made his way laboriously across the open ocean. He had to avoid the war zone below him. The thunder of cannon and the copters flying everywhere made him nervous. He did not like the noisy machines. Somehow he got off course and his wings were so very tired. He had not had food or water for days. But he pushed onward, the precious cargo on his back still unconcious.<br/><br/>He had to land soon, she was fading fast. She needed help, her bones were set and she was mending slowly, but her mind was nearly shattered by the events of the battle in Theramore. The mana bomb could have touched her in a way no one could comprehend. Something about her magic seemed off. The Light was there, but seemed changed, fainter, less intense...colored a bit off..swirling with darkness. For a drake he had limited resources to help her, he could monitor her breathing and body functions, and she was fighting a battle mentally. That much he could tell. <br/><br/>Finally he could fly no more and looked for an island, or any land to set down, he had to eat and drink. And so did Mia...she stirred on his back and moaned. He had to find someone to help her and very soon or she would die. <br/><br/>There! On the left a land mass...but was it moving? It seemed...alive...and moving erratically on the ocean. It was large, as he got closer, coasting on thermals he could see much strife and many many life forms. He finally made it to the top of a mountain and scanned the area. He finally found some small game to him...some kind of critter that tasted good. He gulped it down and looked for water. A small stream held fish and water, he drank his fill. <br/><br/>Mia stirred on his back, she was wrapped in a blanket and secured to his saddle. He looked around and saw a strange bear like creature staring at him. It was dressed in elaborate robes and wore a hat. The drake surmised it to be somewhat sentient and rumbled in common to the creature. "I bid you greetings, mortal. Do not fear, I am not going to eat you. My misstress needs aid...she is in a coma and has many injuries...can you help?"<br/><br/>The Pandaren was so startled by the dragon speaking Common he nearly let his mouth gape in surprise. "You speak? A dragon such as you...so beautiful...welcome to Pandaria. A misstress? Oh! You have a passenger! May I approach and examine her?" he was moved by the dragon's concern for the slight elf strapped to his back.<br/><br/>The huge netherdrake rumbled in his deep voice and lay down as he could on the grassy meadow. "Please help her, she was caught in a magical blast, I fear it has seared her mind. She has broken bones, but a draenei set them and started healing her, but could do nothing for her mind. Her name is Karamia."<br/><br/>The pandaren moved closer and his hands untied the ropes binding her to the saddle. He unwrapped enough blanket to see her red hair and elven features. Her skin was pale and her breathing shallow. Unconcious, with eyes closed and not moving much at all, she was indeed in a coma. "I will take her to our Mistweavers. Perhaps they can reach her and help her." he gently took her into his arms and laid her on the grass. Fashioning a sling he was able to get her on his back and he hurried to the nearby monastary.<br/><br/>The dragon sighed deeply and continued to rest. He worried about Mia. She had not touched his mind in the last day. He hoped he had found someone who could help her. For now all he could do was rest.

<em> Kreindis still hung on the wall of the keep's dungeon. His wrists and ankles felt raw from having been bound for so long without a break. The days went by slowly down here, with nothing for him to do: Seconds turned to minutes, minutes turned to hours, hours turned to days... <br/><br/>He wished he could leave. He wished he could leave, and go be with Tislina. He missed her very much, even though he hadn't been away from her for very long. Sometimes in here, he wasn't sure he would even get to be with her again. If he would even get to hold her close again, if he would ever get to kiss her again. <br/><br/>The burn upon his chest hurt still, and his heart felt sad. He wished this hadn't happened... It was all of his own fault... <br/><br/>Why had he never been strong enough to win his battles, why had he never been strong enough to return safe to the woman he loved...? </em>

<em>Sleep had not come easily. She was restless, dozing off and on through the night. Finally, morning came and she looked to the empty space beside her. An unhappy frown came to her lips as she pulled herself out of the bed and got ready to head out.<br/><br/>As she went down the stairs, she saw the book on the table. A note rested beside it. She looked down at it, recognizing her husband’s handwriting. He had come back last night, but didn’t stay. The thought both heartened and saddened her. She wasn’t truly angry, just hurt and confused at why he had started being so upset with her.<br/><br/>She wiped away a tear as her gaze went to the book. She picked it up, a small smile quirking, wondering where he had found the volume. Tucking his note into the book, she added both to her bags and picked up the pear he had left. She was heading back to the ranks of search and rescue again, needing something familiar that she could use to remind herself that she was worth something after all.<br/><br/>Sometime later, she was back in Kun-Lai Summit, waiting to hear where she would be heading and what she would be doing. With the warm wind meandering through the camp and the sun shining down, it seemed peaceful—something that she was not entirely true, as the land beyond the camp was a battleground between the Yaungol and everyone else.<br/><br/>***<br/>(New entry in a light green leather journal etched with a tree)</em><br/><br/>Last night I didn’t sleep well, which is forgivable considering how the evening went. I woke up from a dream that he had come home and was next to me, only to find that I was alone. I am not certain which hurt worse, him walking out last night or waking up thinking that he might be there and he was not.<br/><br/>When I went downstairs, I realized that he had come home; he just didn’t stay. He left a note apologizing and I have to wonder what is going through his mind right now. He is going to the Temple of the White Tiger and wants me to come find him… I am going to try to make it there. I need to see him. I just don’t know how soon or what to expect when I…<br/><br/><em>She stopped writing and looked up as a pandaran lumbered in front of her with a piece of paper. The instructions were simple: find three pandaran; the task a bit more difficult; find them in a sha infested area. She blew on the page to dry the ink before shutting the book. Her personal life would have to wait; she needed to find some missing pandaran.<br/><br/>It took a bit of effort to shrug off her sadness and get her mind settled on the task but as she galloped across the countryside towards the last known area of the pandaran, she left behind the wife and slipped into the role of the rogue, its mantle slipping over her like an old friend.</em>

<em>The paladin sat in his room, unable to take the pain, unable to take that which was givin to him, he knew what had happened, she left him, and she wasn't going to come back, he gave her his love, he gave her his heart, and she -tore- it out of his chest, and threw it infront of him, he promised her the world, maybe that was just it, maybe she didn't want it all, he gave her his love, and he gave her his all, and she didn't want it, instead she just spat it in his face and made him feel like a dumb idiot, he was tired of it, tired of waiting for her to come home, tired of it all, he knew it was his fault, and he couldn't blame her decision, so he came up with his own, unable to cope with the loss of the woman he loved with all his heart and soul, he took his own life, put a dagger to his abdomen, and pushed the blade through, falling to the floor, his blood, surrounding him, laying there..lifeless..motionless...and still.</em>

I found myself again, and it is all thanks to Cyaer. My sister approached me earlier, and I found out what it was she wanted. Forgiveness. For leaving me the night Tavaras passed. And I could not give it to her. At least not yet. She did tell me she was working with Keyadrion, though. So, I sat dejectedly on a bench for a long time before Cyaer found me. I told him everything that had happened and he felt sorry it had to happen to me. He restored my confidence and my hope. And I know what he said is true. I am smarter than Keyadrion. If he wants to play this game, then that is fine by me. Cunning as he is, I refuse to let him outsmart me because he can't. This is just another mind game, and I always win at those. Granted its way more complicated and the stakes are much higher, but when it comes to knowledge he can't beat me. So what do I do now? Easy, find the flaw. Keyadrion seems to have thought the plan out so well, but there has to be a flaw somewhere. All I need is Krei's location. And I will find it. Somehow.<br/><br/>Even with my confidence restored, doubts still plague my mind. For example, while I spend my time reading, what is Keyadrion putting Kreindis through? And when I do find Krei, what will I do? Cyaer said the Fellowship will help me, that he will help me. And I know this is true. But no matter what we do, Keyadrion still holds Krei's life in his hands, which automatically gives him the advantage. How much am I willing to give up to have Kreindis home safely? I already know the answer. Anything and everything. I just hope I will not have to listen to him suffer more . I think my heart breaks a little more everytime I hear him cry out. If I have to listen to it again, I am sure I will cry again. But not right there. I won't give Keyadrion the satisfaction of that. If he wishes to break my will, he will need to do better. As Cyaer said, the fates are cruel. But things can only get better from here.<br/><br/>Right?

(Tears blot the page, and a pendant is pressed between the papers, a ring bearing two names, both of recently deceased, a cousin, and a cousin's husband, hanging from the chain)<br/><br/>Tria...<br/><br/>(The words are rendered illegible by the ink for a number of lines)<br/><br/>I did not want to bury another family member. I did not want to bury my cousin. I did not want to be found, the somber messenger bearing this ring, and the words...<br/><br/>Light, the words...<br/><br/>(A sheet of paper is tucked between the pages) <br/><br/>"Trianna Sunblaze died in the fighting in Dustwallow Marsh. Her contributions to the war effort were remarkable, we send our condolences to the family, and to the husband of the late Captain Sunblaze. With this medal, we recognize her work for the Horde."<br/><br/>(The writing picks up on the next page)<br/><br/>I didn't want to bury another body. I wanted peace. I came home for this, this...ordeal. I cannot find her husband anywhere. I suppose... who would know? I do not.<br/><br/>Husbands. <br/><br/>They all seem to be missing. Mine, Tria's, Auxi's.<br/><br/>Light's name, Nic, where are you when I need you?<br/><br/>I will return to Pandaria tonight. My cousin is layed to rest, gods she looked so peaceful when I set her in the ground. She died smiling. She died with that grin I cursed so often when she was younger, because it always heralded some sort of mischief I would inevitably be blamed for.<br/><br/>She always smiled, she always laughed, I saw her cry once, and I envy her of the ability she has, had, to find the light in things. I envy her ability to make me laugh. <br/><br/>I want nothing more than to bring her back, and Light knows I tried. Light knows I wish I could. They sent the body, and she looked so peaceful, so happy. She could have been sleeping. She always smiled, even in her sleep. She always smiled. She always laughed. She never cried. She was always ready to get up to some sort of trouble.<br/><br/>Everything was another adventure for her, and then... a stray arrow. She had her armor off, she was fixing it, they said, getting ready to buckle it on again, and then... An arrow. Dead.<br/><br/>She is dead. Never coming back. The Orc who was with her when she died said to tell Loki she was sorry, and the she loved him. And now... now I cannot even find him to tell him that much. <br/><br/>Why? Why Tria? She was young... Young and happy. Why was she there? Why why why why why!?<br/><br/>What does it accomplish? What does it show us?<br/><br/>Please, Light, guide me.<br/><br/>(The rest of the page is damp, and the ink has run)<br/><br/>She was always happy. Always smiling. She always laughed. She never cried.<br/><br/>I miss her terribly.<br/><br/>I never want to bury someone else I love.

(New entry in a light green leather journal etched with a tree)<br/><br/>Sol is back. He apologized, saying that he couldn’t stop the shades of anger and doubt that were running through his mind. He finally sought peace at the Temple of the White Tiger and they purged the sha from his mind. Our first few moments together were tense, I think he was expecting me to be angry.<br/><br/>Not angry, hurt yes, but not angry. I told him that I missed him, that I love him, and that I wasn’t going anywhere.<br/><br/>We spent the afternoon in Binan Village, talking things through. He was his old self again, no longer looking at me as if he suspected I was cheating on him, not accusing me of not knowing where I was or what I was doing. When he laughed, it was happy… not bitter as it had been.<br/> That night, we lay together talking about our day, planning the next until we fell asleep—things we used to do before the doubt and anger clouded him.<br/><br/>It occurred to me as we sat on the bridge looking out over the lake that there had been small signs since he had journeyed to the Dread Wastes. Something happened to him there… something that nearly tore us apart. I hope that this is finished, that he has control of his mind again.<br/><br/>I know just how badly he was hurt by her and just how frightened he is that I could hurt him the same way. I cannot help but feel elated to think that I am that important to him. I know this is selfish of me, but I am happy that she betrayed him. I hate the idea of how painful it must have been, but if she had not turned away, then I could not have stepped in. I know that I have been given something wonderful and I will not walk away from it.

The vendors were still hawking their wares trying for that last sale of the day, and there were a few people strolling the walkways just as I was. There were a few patrons of the Brewfest also making their zigzag paths on the streets as the sun set. It was a wonderful evening for a stroll, and I wished I had Karamia on my arm to enjoy it with her.<br/><br/>I was sauntering along the Court of the Sun when I saw her sitting on the park bench overlooking the court, and the fountain splashed and bubbled behind her. It was my good friend Tislina. It wasn't until I got almost upon her that I caught the redness of her eyes, and could see she had been crying.<br/><br/>I sat beside her as she talked to me of her woes with her sister and Krei's brother. And that they had Krei in some dungeon, and made it a point to have his cries and screams put over the guildstone. And she had endured listening to the tortures being made on the young paladin.<br/><br/>For a space of a moment I went back in time, reliving the horror and cries of Kel'tira and Karamia over the guildstone by Velin, my father. And I knew the pain and heartache that Tis was living now for her beloved Kreindis. And I wrapped my arms around her, trying to console her, knowing it helped, and yet it didn't. <br/><br/>We talked and discussed several things, and I had taken her mind off of Krei and her sister for a moment. One thing I had always respected about this mageling was her quick mind and the way she thought things through. She has been such an asset to the Fellowship, and I told her as much. I told her she was smarter than this warlock that had taken Krei. And that I knew she could outwit him. I could see her mind already thinking about things.<br/><br/>And I offered her my assistance and the Fellowship's help if it was needed. I love Tis and Krei, they so much remind me of Mia and I, and I felt rage over what these two evil kin were doing to my family. Justice needed to be served and Krei released, unharmed and alive. Light give us the strength to do what must be done.<br/><br/>I called her sister, she called me brother. And she left to research some dusty tomes in the library. I hoped I had helped. She seemed more determined when she left. <br/><br/>My mind was heavy with concern for Karamia. My gut tells me something is wrong. And I called Auxi over the guildstone. And she accepted my request. I can but wait and pray that my love is safe. Light protect her, please watch over her, please...can it hear my sorrow, my love and worry in my voice and soul as I make this simple plea?<br/><br/>Karamia...Karamia...hear me...I love you...I'm coming...I'll find you...Karamia...oh, my dear sweet Karamia, hear me...

<em> Kreindis was asleep in the dungeon. He was sweating a little, and he struggled against his bonds in his sleep. He wasn't having a restful sleep, because his mind was stuck in a nightmare...</em> <br/><br/>--[ Inside Kreindis' mind: ]-- <br/><br/><em> He ran through a dark, black forest, chasing after a speck of beautiful white. It was Tislina. She kept running and running from him through the darkness, and he kept chasing her. He wasn't sure why, but he needed to reach her. He absolutely had to. But every time he would get close enough that he could reach out and touch her, she would turn and disappear behind a tree. <br/><br/>Eventually, he couldn't reach her anymore. Things would stop him, and put distance between him and Tislina. It was things like Alliance soldiers, Scourge, Keyadrion, Tradissa... they would pop out, deliver a blow and disappear into the deep black trees. <br/><br/>Eventually he got close to Tislina again. But, he was heavily wounded. Cuts and bruises covered his body. He was crawling on the ground now, his blood leaving a trail behind him. He was close to Tislina now. Kreindis reached out a hand, trying to reach her, but before he can, something lands upon his back and he feels a very sharp pain for a moment before waking with a start, sweating heavily. <br/><br/>He sighed, "Just a nightmare... one to wake from to be in another..." <br/><br/>He did not rest further that night, he rather stayed awake, listening to nothing, and staring into the darkness... </em>

<em>"Don't you want to take a break at all?" Draco frowned as he watched Tislina reading intently. He shifted slightly in his own chair and gazed around the library. This was the latest he had ever stayed in the library and he still couldn't wrap his mind around the idea that Tislina stayed even later than it already was every night.<br/><br/>Without even glancing at him she shook her head. "Can't. This is way to important. But Draco you can go if you want. I don't want you to stay here if you don't want too. And like I said, I'm here alone all the time, so I'm used to being without company. Well, except for Midina. She doesn't count though, since she works here. Plus I think she left early tonight."<br/><br/>Draco watched Amethyst nibble on a piece of fruit Tislina had given her not to long ago. His own stomach rumbled at the thought of food, but he was determined to wait. "It's okay, Tislina. I can wait. That's what friends do, keep each other company. But remind me again what's so important that we have to sit here and read rather than get some food."<br/><br/>Tislina continued her reading, but answered him politely. "We need to find the means to locate someone, using something besides the most obvious techniques because of magical interference. Before you ask, scrying counts as an obvious technique. What we need is to find a spell of some sort that can give us a visual of the person im looking for. The spell has to be able to get around other spells that do things like block out scrying."<br/><br/>Draco sat back in his chair with his mind reeling. Why did she have to be so smart? It was a question he was constantly asking himself. He thought for a little while before he replied. He wanted to sound like he understood what she was talking about. "So, uh..... we can't just scry this person?" He immediately changed tact when he saw her raise an eyebrow at him. "I mean, yeah! There is no way we can just scry. Because that would be way too easy.... And stuff." What was he thinking? He felt like an utter doofus after saying that.<br/><br/>Tislina looked at him for a long time before standing up. "I'm getting a tad hungry. How about we get some dinner and than come back for more research?" Amethyst flew up to land on Tislina's shoulder.<br/><br/>Draco nodded quickly. "Sure. And don't worry. I'm sure you'll be able to figure out a way to find this person." He cursed himself as he saw he face fall, knowing he'd said something wrong.<br/><br/>Tislina managed a small smile. "Thanks." Then she turned on her heel to find dinner, with Draco just behind her.</em>

(1 of 2)<br/><br/>I remember the sailing escapade of getting almost to our destination then the attack of the sea monster with the tentacles. So it was with some trepidation I joined the great Horde faction in a new air ship in search of a new continent. My apprehension was well grounded.<br/><br/>Let me step back a moment, I have been worried about my wife, Karamia, and where she might be. I had given Auxi the tremendous task of possibly finding her, and I trust her and her abilities. So I prepared myself for the task I presented myself, seek out this new manbear continent and explore it. I would rather have Karamia by my side, but I need to trust in the people I give assignments to and move on.<br/><br/>Does that sound cold and heartless? That my wife may be in trouble and need me, then go off on some crazy expedition? I can't explain it, but my gut feeling is Karamia is alive, but needs me. And I am not one to sit in a room and worry myself to death over it. That's not me, and I don't think Mia would want me doing that either. Thus finding myself in the middle of war with the Alliance.<br/><br/>Let me say this, I have had skirmishes with Alliance people, but nothing on the scale I had run into today. And I was not impressed with them one bit. And I have done commissions for the Horde but I resent having orders barked at me. So I wasn't in the best frame of mind when I set forth on this new land of Pandaria (Yeah, someone finally told me the name of this place).<br/><br/>Well, I was given the job of assaulting the fortifications of the Alliance by myself. Typical Horde tactics. And I did I fine job of it too. Almost had the bastard chicken sh*t commander when he up and went gone. I was looking forward to skewering his human hide too. Anyway, I find my commander in a heated discussion with a pandaren. And honestly, I sided with the Pandaren.<br/><br/>I'm not a career warrior or soldier, I can't stand being under someone's supervision 24/7. I'm a freebooter, give me the job, and I'll get it done, but don't stand over me ordering crap, it just doesn't sit well with me. And my commander was one of those that likes to give orders in a loud voice - not a good thing. (Besides, he needs a mint bad, whew, I mean cookie tossing time, know what I mean?)<br/><br/>Now I'm not wise to all the ways of magic, and its use, but this Pandaren said our bad feelings and aggression were causing the very land to bring forth evil things to wander the area we were in. I fought these things, and they smelled and looked evil. What had we brought to this beautiful land? Chaos and war...made me so proud to be Horde let me tell you. NOT.

<em>The woman was silent on her leather-clad feet. Her supple leather armor outline her lithe form that was so often covered by heavy plate. It was a sense of freedom for her, as she ghosted through the city, considering her shortcomings and mistakes as she made her way from the translocation orb to the Hall of Respite.<br/><br/>The night was growing old, and the stars in the east where shimmering only faintly by the time she reached the Hall, and the sheet of paper and dagger she had left there what seemed like a lifetime ago.<br/><br/>Kel'tira Sunblaze, Lady of House Sunblaze, leader of the Rising Sun Fellowship, pulled her hood away from her face, the loose leather and cloth pooling around her shoulders as she shook her hair out. Reaching for her quill, she carefully detached the list of the dead from the board, her hand shaking even as her eyes were dry, if clearly on the edge of tears, as she wrote.</em><br/><br/>The lost endure in our hearts, our minds, honor their memories.<br/><br/>Kara Vaelia -- Yetimus, Light guard her, and us.<br/><br/>Traly Song -- Murlocs, we grieve at the death of one so young.<br/><br/>Keladryn -- Falling off a cliff, he lives on.<br/><br/>Tyrael Firehawk -- Demons, a leader who will always be remembered.<br/><br/>The Sunblaze child -- Who could have been raised one of us.<br/><br/>Kel'thul -- Who despite all he did to us redeemed himself.<br/><br/><strong>Trianna Sunblaze -- Fighting in Dustwallow, I will never forget.</strong><br/><br/><em>Setting that piece aside, the woman carefully draws a fresh sheet from her bags, this one a crisp piece of parchment that shows no wear as it is unrolled. Setting pen to the paper, Kel'tira writes slowly.</em><br/><br/>We face a time of great difficulty, for the world as we know it, and for ourselves. My friends, my family, I ask only that you be strong. Strong and brave. <br/><br/>Do you know how long I have worked to make you all feel at home here in the Fellowship?<br/><br/>Do you know how long those before me, before us, must have worked to get us to where we are?<br/><br/>Can you even guess at the things I must face on a day to day basis, for all of you?<br/><br/>All I ask is that you understand that the things I do are for you all. Not for me, nor for anyone else, I do what I do because I care about each and every one of you, and I want to help, I want to do this, not for me, for you.<br/><br/>Do you know how much I hate it when you turn your backs on me?<br/><br/>Do you know how much it hurts to watch you hurt, but not be able to help, because you have cast me off?<br/><br/>Do you know?<br/><br/><em>Tears splash on the page, Kel's careful control finally breaking, and she moves the parchment further away before she continues writing.</em><br/><br/>What I want does not matter, it never truly has. <br/><br/>I think I knew the day would come when something would happen to make me unfit for the burden I have shouldered, but that day seems to be lurking just below the horizon now. I have buried too many of my family, friends, and loved ones to want to go on with this charade much longer. I have fought back tears as I stood over graves all too often in the past weeks and months. I find myself asking an unanswerable question of the world: Why?<br/><br/>It tears my heart out to watch you all turn away from me. It tears my heart out to watch you all walk away, and look down on me.<br/><br/>Remember that.<br/><br/>Remember that I only want the best for you all.<br/><br/><em>Kel grips the feathered quill tightly, the shaft snapping in her hand, blood running onto the bottom of the page. Breathing heavily, and shaking, she crumples the paper up, hurling it into a corner where it sits for a moment before a cat bats it into the middle of the room.<br/><br/>Oblivious, Kel frowns at Septimus, and then chokes back a sob, kneeling before her winterspring cub, gathering him into her arms and crying in his fur for a moment before straightening and re-pinning the list of the dead to the board. <br/><br/>Touching her bleeding hand with a gently glowing finger, she gathers Septimus in her arms, settling him on her shoulders so he can watch the world go by. As the duo walks out as silently as they entered, the ball of paper lays on the floor silently, the list of the dead flutters in the breeze, and the sounds of the sleeping city filter in as Kel walks towards her home, determined to spend a night in her own bed, with or without her husband.<br/><br/>When she reached the House, she paused at the door, her hand hovering over the wooden paneling, and then she turned away, walking through the darkened city, the only person on the streets, and to the translocation orb.<br/><br/>She would catch the zeppelin to Orgrimar from Undercity, and then from there, return to Pandaria to drown herself in the work that needed to be done.</em>

(2 of 2)<br/><br/>I was weary, I was fighting some cats infected by our rage and anger, and then a call came over the guildstone that I was needed. It was important. I'm not one to let a Fellowship call go unheeded, but I was in the middle of something, meaning helping our Pandaren friends. And Kel'tira came out to find me. I didn't even know she was out here. Surprise, surprise.<br/><br/>It wasn't good, whatever it was, I could tell by Kel's demeanor, and the way she sighed before she started to speak. My heart was beating quickly. I wasn't sure I wanted to hear what she had to say. Karamia was missing, and presumed dead. There had been some kind of explosion in Theramore, and she had been last seen there.<br/><br/>I stopped breathing, and I couldn't hear anything. My mind was locked...presumed dead. No. No, she wasn't dead. They were wrong...she wasn't dead. This wasn't some rejection of what I had heard. I rejected it because my heart knew, it KNEW she was still alive. I just had to find her. Kel tried to talk to me, but I wasn't having any of it. Karamia wasn't dead. Stop saying that!!<br/><br/>We sipped some tea. Then we walked over to the inn. Kel try to support me, to console me, but I could see she was sure of Mia's death. I wanted to cry but the tears wouldn't come. I was half hearing the innkeeper...someone found and aided by their healer..."she"...my heart was in my throat as I walked over to the dark corner of the inn. And I found and saw my Karamia sleeping. I couldn't stop the tears.<br/><br/>I awoke her whispering her name, but...she didn't recognize either of us. Twice in one day, my world stopped. She didn't know who I was, my love, my life...didn't know who I was. I was stunned.<br/><br/>The mind has an amazing way of processing data, and I began to talk softly and gently to my Karamia. I already knew that if it took forever, I would spend the rest of my life helping Karamia remember. No matter how long it took, I would work with her and do everything in my power to help her. I whispered to her that I was her husband, and she made me smile when she said had chosen well. I told her I loved her, and Kel needed me to go outside where she could talk to me in private.<br/><br/>I know Kel'tira was trying to protect me. I know that what she was saying could be true. But my heart wasn't having any of it. She was lost, and she had been found. Presumed dead, and here she was alive. Couldn't Kel see that? Feel any of that? I turned a deaf ear to what she had to say. I wanted her to go away. My heart had turned to stone where Kel'tira was concerned. And light forgive me, I knew better than that. Forgive me, Kel, I am a man in love and I had Karamia back. Please give me that, I beg of you, please give me that if but for a moment.<br/><br/>Karamia and I went for a brief walk. Her body had been healed, we just needed to help her memory heal. She would remember some bits and pieces. I whispered one word to her, "Someday", and she smiled. She remembered a beach beside an ocean or sea. And asked if we had been lovers. I whispered yes, that we were married on a beach surrrounded by our closest friends. And that beach was our special place.<br/><br/>I held her close to me, and she looked up into my face. Her hand wiped away a tear sliding down my cheek. And her lips were so close to mine, I kissed her. Softly and gently, I kissed those full lips of my wife. I'ld like to say her memories all came rushing back to her after one kiss, but that wasn't true. But we will get there. Slowly and surely, we will get there.<br/><br/>I watched over her as she slept that night. She is my angel, and I will protect her from everything. Even myself. For I know I have been given another chance to start a new with my Karamia. A part of me says not to bring up the wrong things, but that wouldn't be fair to her, or myself. Light knows I'm not perfect, and she will need to know all my imperfections. My faults, my failures, and Kel'tira and I. I will tell her everything when the moments present themselves.<br/><br/>Kel'tira had said she might not be the same Karamia I knew. That she could possibly not love me again. I'm willing to take a chance. To take a chance that some way, some how, that she will remember our love. It is my hope and prayer she will remember that love we shared, that forever love we had. And if she doesn't...(tears splashed upon the page, running the ink)...she's alive. But I will cling to that chance that she will remember...

<em>The woman with the brown hair sits on the bamboo floor of an out of the way inn. Her daggers rest beside her, their sharp, clean blades gleaming in the sunlight coming in through the window. Her gaze is firmly fixed on the shaft of light, the small motes of dust sparkling like minute jewels—something oddly beautiful in spite of what had just happened. Her legs are bent, her forearms resting on her knees. Her face is white, as if something has bleached the color from it. Her hands dangle limply as the blood that is covering them slowly dries.</em><br/><br/>Edit: typos

The dawn filtered through the window in a soft glow. Mia woke up gradually, sleep had been deep and restful. If she dreamt it was not remembered. It was as if the clean slate of few if any memories was beneficial to her. She had nothing to regret, nothing to hurt her heart, no decisions to torment her soul. Except for the curiosity...that was something she had to think about.<br/><br/>The time in the monastary had changed her. She was not the same person she had been. The teachings of the monks and the quiet serenity of how they lived had been deeply installed in her heart. The Mistweavers had touched her mind and cleared away cobwebs and pain. They had given her hope and strength. A new beginning. They did not know of the Light that infused her soul, but they sensed a good thing and encouraged her to accept and nurture it.<br/><br/>The way of the Mist was not something she could grasp, but she marveled at their ease of combatting the Sha. The ways of meditation and the grasp of the lore of the land was something that interested her. She wanted to know more about this land and its people. <br/><br/>Now she had a fellow elf beside her. Cyaer Sunblaze, he claimed to be her husband. He was sweet and gentle, but something about him seemed very capable of dealing damage with his blades. She was greatful for his patience, if she remembered anything...it would be due to his coaxing and gentle touch. He was handsome as well. His raven hair glossy and soft, his build strong and capable. His eyes...how she loved gazing into those green eyes. She could see love and concern there. Patience and understanding, but something more. What was he hiding she could not comprehend, did he harbor dark secrets? Was there something he would not tell her about their past?<br/><br/>Her face changed as a slight frown crossed her features. Turning in the small bed she was in to see him sleeping in the other bed in the room. His features looked so calm and sweet as he slept. Because she did not remember being his wife he had gone to the other bed and told her to rest. He would wait, he said, until she felt comfortable knowing he was her husband. <br/><br/>Her mind in turmoil, she thought of the things he had said. The beach...a special place on Sunstrider Isle....something clicked in her mind. Days of training with a sword, hard work and many falls. Bruises and victories. These things flitted across her mind like bugs, never landing, never making sense. Light...Light was filtering in slowly through the window as the sun rose. Light was important to her somehow. Why was the sun so bright, and yet something stirred in her that was not sunlight, but brighter. A gentle glow that rose inside with a growing fierceness that threatened to explode..<br/><br/>Her heart pounding she rose from the bed and made her way to the dressing room. There in a trunk was new armor she had earned from her new friends in Pandaria. Gleaming and strong it called to her memories. She fingered the ornate sword and the beauty and funtionality of the shield. She donned the armor and picked up the sword and shield. Moving quietly she left the room. Cyaer was still sound asleep.<br/><br/>She had to find out what she was, what this thing inside of her was trying to tell her. Outside the Pandaren nodded to her fully armored form. She bowed to him and asked for a training grounds, a place to swing her weapon and try out her abilities, or try to remember them. His expressive face was quizzical as he directed her to the training area. She found others there. Watching for a moment she saw a dark clad Sindorei warrior bashing a target dummy with precision and fury. This was stirring things inside of her, but not as much as she hoped.<br/><br/>Then the area was lit up with a bright Light as a paladin training across the yard hit the training dummy with a bolt of pure Light. Mia gasped as the Light rose within her and she knew this was part of her past. The Tauren lashed out with the Light and struck the dummy along with his axe. He moved with grace for one of his size. It inspired her to try and match him. Picking a dummy that was still untouched she drew her sword and began making a few swings at it. Almost immediately her hands filled with an instinctual glow and she lashed out with a bolt of Light. Glorious feeling washed over her as she continued to bash the target and deal both physical and Light based damage.<br/><br/>(1/2)

As Mia continued to bash and strike the target with Light it occured to her that this was indeed part of her past and would be important to her future. She had to learn more, strive for the inner peace and serenity she had found here in Pandaria, but not forget the lessons of the past.<br/><br/>Her exhaustion finally led her to stop, and she thanked the warrior who had offered to spar with her. He had been surprised at her skill as she bested him and left him sitting on the ground. Then she felt something more well up inside of her. Reaching out with the Light she healed his wounds. She could heal! This was something that surprised and delighted her. The warrior was smiling and offering her breakfast. He was impressed with her even more and wanted something she could see in his eyes the hunger for something. But she smiled and declined. She had a husband, she explained. And his ears wilted, but he nodded and turned away. He seemed to be muttering something as he turned. "Lucky guy.."<br/><br/>Mia chuckled and went to clean up, changing back into her gown and soft slippers, she put the armor and weapon away and sat in the common room of the Inn and sipped tea, waiting for Cyaer to join her.
