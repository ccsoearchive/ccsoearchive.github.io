Perhaps it is that. I have not mourned properly the death of two people I loved. My sister..and Alen. I have merely pushed the pain away..refused to deal with it and now it has made me sour to the world. Bitter and cold. I hate this, I hate them for dying, I hate this book, and I hate writing in it. I hate admitting this and I hate that I am not yet ready to deal with this pain properly. I hate Solorin and I hate my cousin. I cannot believe I have written what I just wrote, and I will not believe it is true! What am I doing to myself?<br/><br/> <em> Lyrilia slams the book shut suddenly, dropping her quill into the sandy grass at the base of the tree. Her eyes flared with anger at herself. At the world, at everything she hated. The pain she had not yet dealt with turning to a bitter hatred. Perhaps she could speak to Azurick of this, he seemed fine now....relatively unaffected now? He had passed her tests....he knew Alen...perhaps she could trust him just this once? No. Trusting a person is foolish. He will help her with what she needs him for and nothing more. But, perhaps he might understand.....Fine. I shall ask him how he has forgotten so quickly, nothing more. I will be bitter if I wish.<br/><br/>"People are like burrs. You let yourself get to close to them, and they cling to you or scratch and hurt you. Annoying as hell." She growled to herself, leaning her head back against the tree. Sighing deeply she sorted her thoughts, pushing away those of pain and doubt back into the corners of her mind, wishing to drown them away as she had been doing before Azurick had found her.<br/><br/>"Azurick. I shall not speak to him of anything but what I have asked. He will tell me if he finds Alen's body, and then we shall go from there." She had been pushing away pain for so long, it had always worked just fine for her.<br/><br/>Or had it really?</em><br/><br/>[[2/2]]

( Kreindis here, my character selection isn't switching my toons I'm logged into, and I was logged on to this one... )<br/><br/><em>Kreindis leans against a tree in the dark of night, his only light source coming from a fire nearby. His red dragonhawk Phoenix floated nearby him. A couple other Paladins lay asleep around the fire, under the blankets that had been brought, but Kreindis stayed awake, guarding the rest of the Paladins. He felt as if he was forgetting something, though. Something important. He couldn't place his finger on what it was until he started thinking about Tislina, and how much he missed her already. He had yet to tell her where he had gone! He quickly pulled out a piece of parchment and his quill, and began to write on it,</em> <br/><br/>Tislina, I had forgotten to tell you this in person, so I will tell you now. I, with a couple more Paladins, have been sent to Eversong for a week-long training trip. Yet again, Tislina, I'm sorry for not telling you in person before I was sent. I promise I'll be back by Friday, to see you again. Stay safe while I'm gone. I love you. <br/> - With love, Kreindis<br/><br/><em>Kreindis handed the letter to his Dragonhawk, after telling it to take the letter to Tislina, immediately took off to Silvermoon City. <br/><br/>Kreindis leaned back on the tree again, falling into a tired sleep.</em>

<em>Tislina quietly entered her dark bedroom after coming up from dinner. She flicked her wrist and the room lit up as candles seemed to light themselves. She collapsed onto her soft bed with a sigh and stared at the ceiling. It had been quite a long day for her. Amethyst chirped happily as she landed on the bed next to Tislina, playing with her hair. The Mage smiled and stood walking over to her wardrobe and pulling out some night cloths. She changed and pondered whether to read a few chapters out of her novel or not, then heard the familiar tapping in the window. Opening she saw the familiar red dragonhawk holding a letter. She smiled softly and took the letter, then watched the dragonhawk glide silently off into the night. She sat at her desk and read over the note, frowning slightly. Amethyst could sense her distress and flew over to rub against her hand. "Kreindis is gone, and so is Xal." she turned the thought over in her mind for a little while, then grabbed a fresh piece of parchment and her quill.</em><br/><br/>Kreindis,<br/>I miss you very much all ready. Please do not worry about me too much. I am in Silvermoon City. What's the worst that could happen? Please, please, please be careful. Do not overwork yourself. If there are other paladins with you, do not be afraid to let them do some of the work. And don't forget to watch your back. I will see you Friday. <br/><br/>Love always, Tislina <br/><br/><em>Quietly she folded her letter and turned it over to the dove that had appeared on her windowsill. She silently slid onto bed with Amethyst curling up next to her. Vaguely she wondered if she should be concerned for her own safety, but eventually shook the feeling off. She would be okay. She had been taking extra training courses. She smiled and pulled the sheets around her and drifted off into sleep. But in the back of her mind, she wished she was not so alone. </em>

Azurick stood on the edge of the Tainted Scar. He glanced back and forth over the barren landscape. Several hulking demons patrolled up and down the scar. Azurick frowned. He would have to make this fast. He opened his map where he had marked the spot where Alenthis had been reported to have been killed. He noted the spot and then refolded his map. Azurick made his way along the cliff walls, trying to stay in the shadows, away from the demons gaze. He moved stealthily through the underbrush towards the Altar at the far side of the Scar. Or where the Altar should have been. In the distance he could already tell something was off. The Altar was split down the middle and rubble covered the ground. <br/><br/>Azurick crawled along the ground as quietly as he could to avoid the demons' gazes. He frowned. <em>These damned robes are going to need serious scrubbing when this is finished. </em> Azurick moved to a crouch and crossed the distance quickly to the altar. He leaned against the altar and glanced around. <br/><br/>Several pieces of Dreadlord Armor lay around the altar, indicating a struggle. A huge swath of dried blood stained the ground on one side of the altar. Azurick dipped his finger into it and took an arcane reading of it. It was Alenthis' blood alright...but where was the body? Azurick frowned. He looked at the ground and noticed the stain sort of dragged off. Perhaps Alen had crawled a ways? Azurick followed the blood carefully. The trail stopped about half a mile from the Altar. A large pool of blood was there. But again, no Alenthis. Azurick curled his lip in frustration. <em>There should have at least been remains.</em> <br/><br/>Azurick thought for a moment. Apparently the Warlock Viragona had been spotted nearby right after Alen's death. He had no idea where she would go though. Azurick mounted his dragonhawk and headed for Grom Gol, where he could hitch a zeppelin ride back to the Tirisfal Glades. Azurick shifted in the saddle slightly. He would dig around and find out where Viragona's hideout was. Perhaps if he could watch her base, he would catch a glimpse of Alen. Worse case scenario, he could still spy on an enemy of the Fellowship. Not all a lost cause.

<em>Blood....<br/><br/>It dripped from the cave's roof....<br/><br/>It dripped down the walls.......<br/><br/>In the middle of the cave, stood Aseria Sunblade, two long glowing katana's in her hand, each covered and dripping with crimson blood. Around her, bodies of dead Twillight cultists were strewn across the floor, impaled with multiple swords of the same nature. Some where charred to the bone, others where just stabbed, some where impaled against the wall, Ash had came here for one thing and one thing along.<br/><br/>Another rune artifact...<br/><br/>Dropping her swords, which vanished into thin air, she walked over to a box that held the rune. The cave was kinda of the same like the one she had destroyed when she and the Witch still lived in Greymane Manor, and like that cave, the guards were weak and pathetic. Nothing but rambling fools in the eyes of the Pyromancer.<br/><br/>Opening the box and taking the rune, she slipped it into the bag filled with the rest of the runes she had collected </em> "Five....three more to go" <em> she thought to herself. She was about to turn and leave until a mirror caught her eye. It wasn't really a mirror, more just a large shinny piece of glass. She felt drawn to it, and advanced towards it, looking at her reflection. In her new purple armor, she looked fierce, dangerous, a killer. Blood stains were spotted here and there, but over all...she seemed rather clean despite the massacre she just caused. <br/><br/>Slowly, she removed her helm, ebony hair spilling over her shoulders. <br/><br/>"You know....I'd always say you remind me of mother in a way..."<br/><br/>The voice was frighteningly familiar. Whirling around, a sword conjuring in her hand, she flung it at the source of the voice. It struck the other side of the cave wall near the head of what appeared to be a woman dressed in long icy blue robes. Hair reached passed her waist, almost spiky but beautiful in a way. Her face was youthful, black feather like tattoos hugged her eyes "Then again...father said we both kinda did"<br/><br/>"L-Lia?" Aseria stuttered, shocked, confused, amazed, emotions running through her head. She felt dizzy, like she was about to faint "You're dead....." she whispered. "And you're out of your mind." Lia replied, 'pushing' herself off the wall to walk over to her sister, standing a good foot taller than her younger sister "Look at you...Ash...this isn't you. You were always so kind, careing, you used such sanity for good...not for this!" she gestured to the corpses laid out on the floor.<br/><br/>Aseria snorted "This is all my imagination.....I fear nothing anymore, Lia! In fact it should be my enemies that fear me!" she turned, her eyes closed, as if when she opened her, Lia would be gone and she would wake up from what ever hallucination she was having "Even you fear me...Sister..." Lia shook her head, smiling warmly at the Pyromacer "I don't fear you, Ashy...I love you...please...snap out of it. Kel can help you! Please!"<br/><br/>It was then Aseria screamed, conjuring another sword and taking a swing at the woman. But her blade met nothing, Lia wasn't even there anymore...she was gone "Please....Ash..."<br/><br/>Ash...<br/><br/>Ash!....<br/><br/>"Aseria!"<br/><br/>The mage jolted, frightened, she turned to see that the Witch, Krystala, had entered the cave, her eyes wandering around the room at all the bodies "An impressive slaughter..." she would mutter before turning to the Pyromancer "I heard you scream, everything alright?". Aseria just stared at her, dumb struck "I could have sworn...I saw...my sister...Lia.." The Witch raised a brow "Really?" The mage nodded slowly.<br/><br/></em> "This isn't good....something tells me Lia's soul is still wandering the earth...and trying to set Ash free..."[i] thought the little Witch, muttering words of dark power under her breath. Ash had opened her mouth to say something, but only to alow a stream of shadow energy enter her system. She coughed, kneeling down and grasping the collar of her tunic. "There...that should refresh the spell...ready to go home yet, Aseria?"<br/><br/>The mage slowly raised her head, her lip set in a straight, hard line before it broke into a wide and crazed grin "Yes...I am...". She stood up, creating a portal and walking through it with out another word. Krystala stayed for a moment, looking around the cave before entering the portal herself.<br/><br/>Lia watched from the entrance, her sad gaze watching the portal close before she faded in hopes to find Kel.

<em> Kreindis looked tired and exhausted as he sat at the camp set up by him and the other Paladins sent with him to Eversong, watching the fire as it illuminated the night. <br/><br/>He had spent the day training in everything he had trained in ever since he became a Paladin. Healing, fighting with his sword and shield, and fighting with the Light. He felt... stronger. More powerful with the Light, and his weapons. <br/><br/>Yet, Kreindis still felt something was wrong. Maybe it was that Tislina was left unprotected. Kreindis reminded himself that in her letter to him that she told him not to worry about her, but he couldn't help it. He loved Tislina with all his heart, and he wanted her to be safe. <br/><br/>Kreindis sighed, and said quietly to himself, "You can worry about her when you go back to Silvermoon to be with her again..." He leaned against the tree behind him and closed his eyes, his mind on Tislina, and how worried for her he was, and falling into an uneasy sleep...</em>

<em>Tislina sat in class with nine other 'advanced' mages. An advanced mage burnt himself with a candle. Zaedana stood at the front of the room scolding him for playing with fire in class. Tislina yawned. It had been another long day of training, it was late and she knew she should have been in bed, but she wanted more training. Zaedana turned to the board and magically wrote the word 'Abjuration' on it. She turned back to the class. <br/><br/>"Can anyone tell me what Abjuration is?" Of course no one raised their hands. Tislina knew, but had been told to 'give the other students a chance.' Zaedana smiled and looked at Tislina. "Tislina, can you please tell us what Abjuration is?" Tislina nodded once.<br/><br/>"Abjuration is the study of protective magic." And so the lesson went on until finally the class had been dismissed. Except for Tislina. She looked quizzically at Zaedana. "You wanted to speak with me?" The instructor sat at her desk and folded her hands. <br/><br/>"Tislina, I would advise you to take a break. The other instructors and I have noticed your nonstop training and studies lately. I understand you want to be a great Mage one day, but take it slowly. Doing all this work at once is just over working you and causing you to be exhausted." Tislina nodded blankly. <br/><br/>"I understand. I'll try to take it easy in the next few days, but I won't make any promises." Zaedana nodded once and Tislina turned around gathering up Amethyst in her arms. The little whelp had fallen asleep on the edge of her desk. Turning to the door silently, Tislina left and started for home. In the quiet of the room Zaedana smiled in satisfaction. She knew Tislina would take it easy, after all not even an archmage would train and study for that long without rest. She gathered her things and left for home, all the while wondering what her favorite student would do on her days off.<br/><br/>As Zaedana would later find out, she did not know her students as well as she thought. Because in spite of the warnings, Tislina continued to push herself.</em>

I have listened to the gentle sound of the surf the past few days, and it has calmed me, as I have felt the curse of this rune upon me.<br/><br/>I have come out here for several reasons. The place holds a special appeal to me with the smell of the sea, the warmth of the sand shifting beneath feet as I walk the shore, and it is where I vowed to be true to the one I was marrying that day.<br/><br/>I have come out here for it is secluded from other people, more precisely, women. The urges were stronger and stronger, and I value my vow and my wife's heart, so I had to leave the city. My home, my birthplace...my possible downfall if I stayed. I hate this rune, and how it controls me to a certain extent.<br/><br/>And I have come out here on the hopes she will come here too. My Karamia, my wife, the woman I hold so very dear...and who I desire more than any other woman. I close my eyes, and I see her before me. Her smile that captivated my heart, her eyes that captured my soul, and those soft warm lips that hold my desires and yearnings.<br/><br/>I can see her in my mind's eyes, and she is so inviting, so very real to me...I can feel the tears as they roll down my cheeks, and taste their saltiness. I weep for I cannot and will not betray her love or trust again...I cannot....I will not. I clench my fists and want to scream. To cry out my frustrations...to rid myself of this curse.<br/><br/>To be free of it, free to be me...and not this beast waiting...lurking in wait...seeking its prey...yes, the pretty prey...so young....so beautiful...so sexy...

I have been assigned to work as a team with Kistrel, the the young warrior. We make a fairly decent team. Her fighting skills are improving, and we drop scourge all around us. I watch her as she fights, she has a good stance and good form. She must have caught me watching her, for she turned several shades of red. I merely told her I was checking out her good stance and wonderful form. That brought forth a nice round of light laughter from the warrior. What? What did I say?<br/><br/>I ate quickly this evening, and spent several hours gazing at my sketchbook. My fingers grazed the pages as I looked upon my muse, my beautiful muse...my Jahana. I feel so out of touch with her. Out of touch with my Fellowship. Just forgotten.<br/><br/>I had begun to doze when I felt her lips upon my own. They were soft, and sweet, and for one brief moment, I thought I was with Jahana. As I reached up to bring her close, I realized it was not Jahana, but Kistrel who was in my arms. She smiled down at me and kissed me again. And I kissed her back, light forgive me, I kissed her back. She lay with me in my arms and she felt good to be there. <br/><br/>As we made ourselves comfortable, we kissed again and again. Her body was hard and muscular, and yet I knew I held a woman close to me. And the night was filled with passion, and when I awoke the next morning, she stirred slightly, and reached out to pull me close to her.<br/><br/>We were both late for roll call this morning.

<em>The air ship had been cruising through thick fog for some time now. Between the dense fog and the hum of the engines, the airship was a rather eerie place. People moving about the ship were dark shadows in the fog. Appearing suddenly and disappearing as the swirling mists enveloped them. Even the voices of the crewmen calling back and forth were hushed, muffled by the fog.<br/><br/>The woman with the brown hair sat on the upper deck with her husband. It was not her first foray into strange, fog shrouded eeriness, but still, it was reassuring to have him with her. Soon—or at least she hoped soon—they would be in a new land.<br/><br/>‘Don’t think of it as heading out to fight,’ she had told him several days before they had shipped out, ‘think of it as an opportunity for us to explore a new place.’<br/><br/>That sentiment proved to be ill fated as the fog clear and land was spotted—and an Alliance warship.<br/><br/>“OPEN FIRE!”<br/><br/>The airship rocked as the Alliance mortars fell about them. She jumped to her feet beside her husband who was already moving. The ship was hit again, causing him to nearly loose his balance as he tried to made his way towards the airship’s cannons. She wasn’t far behind him.<br/><br/>The ship jolted and abruptly listed to one side, this time, he didn’t stay on his feet. “SOLORIN!” she screamed as he lost his balance and tumbled over the side of the ship. She scrambled towards him even as the orcs shouted for her to stay put. Another mortar hit, landing near her. She was flung back against the deck, cracking her head on the wood. The sounds of battle ceased as the world went back.<br/><br/>***<br/>(New entry in a light green leather journal etched with a tree)</em><br/><br/>I am in a place called Honeydew Village. The innkeeper is a kind bear-woman—a Pandaran, as she calls herself—who has insisted on brewing me a cup of tea after she heard the tale of why I came here. It smells and looks nothing like the tea I am used to, but it is fragrant, like flowers and grass. It is sitting here in front of me, steaming up a light fog…<br/><br/><em>The woman with the brown hair leaned forward and blew the small fog of steam that hovered above the cup away.</em><br/><br/>I ended up here while I am searching for my husband. He went over the edge of the airship when we engaged the Alliance. A goblin said he saw him hit the water and come back up, so for now I will assume he is alive and out there. There is an airbase that was taken from the Alliance not far from here, perhaps they will be able to help me.<br/><br/>For the moment, I will stay here, drink the strange tea (I can hear Kel’Tira laughing at me) and listen to the innkeeper’s soothing words. I am tired, aching and a little nauseate and dizzy from where my head hit the deck. At least my memories are still intact, I didn’t lose those and I pray that I haven’t lost my husband.<br/><br/>No, I haven't! He is out there somewhere and I will find him, alive and in one piece. Finding people is my specialty, after all.

<em>Kreindis kneeled beside a few other Paladins, hidden by foliage. The day had been spent practicing ambushing on various creatures in Eversong Forest, as much as Kreindis didn't like to sneak upon his foes. Right now, that creature was a Springpaw Lynx, eating a large chunk of meat. Not many of the Paladins wanted to know what it came from, Kreindis included. The black haired Blood Elf at the front of the group whispered to the rest, "Three... two... one..." She made a swift forward motion with her right hand. <br/><br/>The group of Paladins leapt out of their cover, weapons drawn. The lynx had not expected them, and had fallen, dead, in seconds.<br/><br/>The leader smiled, "Great job! That'll be the la-" She froze at the sound of rustling in the bushes around them. A younger, blonde haired male Blood Elf looked at the leader, "What was that?" She motioned for him to be quiet, and he did. Then, from the bushes, emerged multiple lynxes, to replace the first. The Paladins fell back into a circle, each one had a lynx to handle.<br/>Suddenly, the lynxes lashed out at the Paladins with their claws, some finding a mark.<br/>Kreindis was one of those people the lynxes claws had found, more specifically his chest. He cried out in pain as the claws raked across his chest, his blood wetting them. Kreindis swung his sword at the lynx, the blade finding its throat. As the lynx fell, dead, he looked around. <br/><br/>The other Paladins had finished their own opponents in a similar fashion. A healer looked at Kreindis' chest wound, "Would you like me to heal that?" Kreindis shook his head, "I'm fine..." The leader shrugged, "Alright everyone! Back to camp for dinner!" This got a couple cheers from some Paladins, as they walked back to camp. Not known to them, Kreindis' wound still trickled blood out of it, and he needed attention from a healer more than he thought he did...</em>

<em>Tislina was panting by the time she had finished her training session. All around her the remains of the training dummies lay strewn across the ground. Some where covered in little white frosty crystals. Some lay still smoldering in the ground. And still others had been blown apart by the overwhelming power of her Arcane magic. She became aware of various Blood Knights and Rangers staring at her and whispering. She walked to the nearest paladin, and reaching into her bag, she produced a small pouch full of coins. She placed it into his hands and told him to use it to cover the cost of the replacement dummies. He nodded at her and went to look for his instructor. Tislina gathered up Amethyst, who was in the process of teasing a rangers dragonhawk, and started for home. Returning home, she flicked her wrist and the candles lit themselves. She sat down at her desk and opened a large tome, reading about Conjuration. She read on and on for a few hours, until finally she shut the book and leaned back in her chair. <br/><br/>She thought for a moment before leaning forward and opening one of her desk drawers, revealing a few letters. Picking the topmost one up, she read over it, smiling at Krei's familiar handwriting. Only tomarrow. She only had to wait a little bit longer, then she would see him again. She placed the letters back in the drawer, then stood and changed into her night gown. She quietly slid into bed, Amethyst curling up next to her. It didn't take long for her to fall asleep. And when she did, she slept well.</em>

Alenthis sat in a chair at the top of Viragona's tower. He was doing something he hadn't done in a long time. He was dreaming... Alenthis stood at the top of the tower opposite Lyrilia. They spoke and kissed before Alen left. He found himself in the Blasted Lands. He looked left and right as demons closed in around him. And then a dagger pierced his skull and the dream would start over again. <br/><br/>Alenthis awoke with a start. He sat up straight and glanced around the tower. Still no Viragona. He stood up and made his way through the tower looking for any sign of her. He looked out the window for a moment, deep in thought. <em>Enough of this. If she kills me, so be it.</em> Alenthis hefted his backpack and walked out the door. He turned around and looked back up at the large stone tower. He made a rather rude gesture at it and then sprinted for the woods. He would find somewhere safe to hide.<br/><br/>After several hours, he had reached the border of the Redridge Mountains and Elwyn Forest. It would be a long journey. He could head north, for Forsaken territories, or South to Grom Gol's air tower. He frowned. He grabbed his compass out of his backpack, checked it, and then headed North. <br/><br/>As he walked he considered his situation. Viragona had a piece of his soul with her. He didn't know if that meant she could track him. She certainly had power over him though. He needed to find a source of magic that would hide him from her. But he had no idea what to even start looking for. He also needed to figure out a way to sever his lost soul from it's piece that Viragona had...and he had no idea how to do that either. <br/><br/>"Damnit." <em>Alenthis took a deep breath and broke into a sprint. Time to cover some ground.</em>

<em>The woman with the brown hair stood near the wooden fence that surrounded the captured airbase. Beyond the fence stretched part of the Jade Forest—a rather pretty name that belied the current chaos under the foliage. Strange and angry monkey-like creatures were hopping about, attacking anyone who got close enough. A few even rushed the airbase, only to be brought down swiftly by the orcs who were guarding it. The airbase itself was in pieces from the attack that claimed it from the Alliance. A few goblins were rushing about gleefully with the prospect of rebuilding and a few were looking for parts to make bombs.<br/><br/>Inquiries about her husband had yielded little results.<br/><br/>“Look elf, if you want your husband, just pick of them,” the orc waved a hand at a small group of blood elves who had aided in retaking the base. “They are all men, we all work the same. Just pick one and get on with it. There is work to be done!”<br/><br/>She felt that he obviously needed to be reminded as to what the words <strong>married </strong>and <strong>husband </strong>meant, but wasn’t going to take the time to explain it. He was busy at the moment trying to get the airbase back up and running and fending off strange and angry monkey-people and she wasn't going to find Solorin by pestering the insensitive orc. Moving past the blood elves (who had not seen her husband, either) she looked over the lay of the land beyond the airbase and contemplated how she was going to navigate it.<br/><br/>The good news was that there was a nearby inlet that he could have worked his to in order to reach land. The bad news was that when he reached land, he would find himself surrounded by strange and angry monkey people. She was still thinking positively that she would find him alive, but looking out into the battlefield her felt her hopes drop a little.</em>

<em>The Scourge were losing. They had fallen back. I figured they were preparing to retreat. I was wrong. I was so very wrong.<br/><br/>Kistrel and I had been ordered to hold the line here. It was a the empty shell of a house, but it would be a the route the Scourge would most likely come through to get to our forces. Reinforcements were coming, just hold the line here.<br/><br/>We are a good team when it comes to fighting the Scourge, and we were laughing when the first initial troops hit us. Kistrel rushed them, her large sword would often take out one or two in that first charge. I backed her up, my shield flashing out to send a few more to wherever the damned go, and my spells of the light burning and causing the undead an eternal death from which they would not return.<br/><br/>We fought them, and defeated them for nearly an hour non-stop. Then the surge hit us. And I mean they hit us hard. We were sorely tested as the Scourge came and kept on coming in waves it seemed. I could see Kistrel's strength waning, and I bolstered her morale by laughing and saying was this all they could bring against us. I felt weariness coming on me too. But we kept up the fight until there were carcasses waist high around us.<br/><br/>And still they kept coming...the big abominations, the rattling skeletons, and the spellmages. And we kept hitting them over and over again. We fought without respite, we fought when we thought we could not fight any longer, and we fought for our families, our friends, our people. We fought.<br/><br/>I heard her scream as the tall abomination grabbed her and threw her across the floor to slam against the only wall of this decrepit house. She fell to the floor, still and quiet.<br/><br/>I lost it. I lost it completely, and I went into a rage. I felt the power of the light infuse within me as I threw spells of destruction that caused the undead all around me to fall writhing in pain and anquish. My shield was flashing out and sending more to the fires of hell. And my weapon came down continuously crushing skulls, and severing heads. And still they kept coming. More and more of their troops kept coming.<br/><br/>I was drained...I had no more to give and yet I fought on. I took down several more as they began to surround me. I had failed. I had failed Kistrel. I had failed Jahana. I had failed my mother and father. I had failed the light, and the Blood Knights. I had failed my Fellowship.</em> <br/><br/><strong><em>We regret to inform you that the young paladin known as Neryth of Silvermoon City has died in the service of the Horde. In war, death can occur, and the Warchief sends his deepest sympathies to the Rising Sun Fellowship in the loss of a friend and companion. He was a valued soldier and officer of the Horde.</em></strong>

<em>In the early hours of the morning the Knight Sat with is wife, he smiled at her, kissing her once, when the fog came...that was the last her actually saw of her....before he knew it, they were under attack, "GET TO THE CANNONS!" he heard a goblin yell, quickly, he rushed over to the cannons, shooting every which way he could at the alliance below, after a few short moments, the alliance shot them down, an explosion in the Hull forcing Solorin off the side, he reached out to his wife, "AUXI!!" he fell and landed in a nearby river...it was strange...he awoke late in the day...He walked out of the river and fell to his knees, his ankle was sprained...he could tell, and touching his left shoulder, he felt a large piece of Shrapnel loged within, he pulled it out...Yelping out in pain, he threw it into the river.<br/><br/>He walked until he stumbled among an alliance scout, he took a rock and bashed him in the head, taking his dagger, he attempted to remove more of the little pieces, he was scared...to be honest...He for the first time in one-hundred years, he feared for his life, he was afraid...what If They took Auxilia...what if some thing got her? He had to find his wife, there was no ands ifs or buts about it, so he set out.<br/><br/>He came across some panda looking folk? strange creatures, but they offered him food and some shelter, to which he politely accepted, he stayed there before the farm was attacked by creatures known as...Hozen...Monkey..baboon looking creatures, he must have killed hundreds, until finally, he was needed at some air base...<br/><br/>He made his way to the air base, killing any and all alliance that stood in his way, using only one arm to slice through them, his other....was still weary from blood loss, after they took over the Air base, a pandaren offered to bandage his shoulder, Solorin could not refuse, after being bandaged, he drank some more of that strange...but delicious tea, and took off to kill more Hozen, after he must have killed thirty...or fourty, he heard his name,<br/><br/>"SOL!"<br/>The Knight quickly turned around... "Auxi..." "AUXI!!!" <br/><br/>He had found his wife...and he was with her once more...on this horrible battlefield...but at least he would not be alone..He spent some time with her, they went off where ever they were needed, before finally settleing in a place called Honeydew Village, he was happy to have her by his side again...Only one thought remained, Where was Xal?</em>

<em>Dawn's usual kind and happy demeanor had been replaced by a not so usual highly irritated and slightly angry one. She was in Orgrimmar, standing outside the warchief's throne room, arguing with a guard. Again. For two days she had waited in Orgrimmar, seeking out the warchief's council and she had yet to get it. <br/><br/>"Listen elf," the orc was saying. "I understand your questions and concerns about this matter. Believe me, I do. Do you know how many people come ask about it a day? Please try to understand, Garrosh is a very busy person and he will speak with you when he is ready. Now, this is the ninth time I've seen you in the passed two days. Don't you have something better to do?"<br/><br/>Dawn glared at him. "As a matter of fact, I do not. This is a very important matter to myself, and although I am not a high ranking officer in the Horde, I have the same right to see the warchief as they do. What is he so busy with that he has had to decline my petition nine times?"<br/><br/>The orc shifted uneasily. He didn't have a clue why the warchief wouldn't speak with this girl, but he certainly couldn't let her know that. "He is very busy with the war efforts. You know, positioning troops, sending out reinforcements, planning out next offensive attack. That kong of thing."<br/><br/>Dawn smiled slightly. "How fortunate. My question actually has a few things to do with the war effort. If that is what he is currently doing, I don't see why I can't go and speak with him."<br/><br/>The orc was starting to worry. If he couldn't get this girl to leave, he would be in some trouble. He had to admire her persistence though. He reached out and placed a hand on her shoulder. "Listen, I know you want to know what's going on, but between you and me, I'm not even sure the warchief knows. I like you. You've got spirit and I admire that. I don't want to have to get you in trouble. So please, go relax at the inn, go find some food, shop, do whatever. Just please go. My name is Nazgrom. I promise when I find something out about your problem, I'll come and find you."<br/><br/>For a minute, he thought she would decline and continue her argument. But then the fire in her eyes died and her shoulder sagged. "Okay," she mumbled and started toward the inn. Nazgrom felt bad for her. As Dawn walked her thoughts whirled around. "oh Xal, wherever you are please be safe....."</em>

<em> Kreindis sat in his tent at the Paladin's camp in Eversong Forest, three thin mageweave bandages were across his chest. His once shining armor was stained now with the crimson blood of himself and his foes. Blood had also dripped onto his black journal, ruining some pages. He had already removed the pages that were not ruined, and placed them in an empty blue bag of his. He glanced at his new journal. It was a light, almost icy blue color, with black corners. He looked at it for a while, before picking up his quill, and opening it, and beginning to write... </em><br/><br/>I have began a new journal, for.. a couple reasons. One, my other was out of pages anyway. Two, I may have... dripped some blood from a wound on the pages, by accident. I did manage to salvage a couple pages, and it was nice to remember... happier times. Like the day I told Tislina of how I felt for her. <br/><br/>Anyways, I have stored those pages safely, and started fresh. Hopefully, I'll get to write some new things in this, and remember other things. <br/><br/>Hopefully...

There is something to be said about a sunrise over the ocean. The colors are reflected on the surface of the water, and the waves and surf make those colors undulate and sparkle as the sun goes higher into the morning sky. I was fortunate enough to watch the sunrise this morning.<br/><br/>My supplies are low, and I will need to go into Falconwing Square to restock them. A part of me looks forward to seeing people again, any people, I am a social animal and need the interaction of people. And then there is another part of me directed by a magical rune. I will need to control that part of me, and hold on to the man I am.<br/><br/>I am not a beast, I'm a civilized man, I am a son of the Sin'dorei, and I must maintain that sense of civility. It's only supplies...go in, buy them, and return to my seclusion. I can do this. I have emptied my bags in anticipation of filling them, and stored my few possessions in the gazebo building nearby. Light give me strength.<br/><br/>The road was clear, well, except for the guards on patrol. And I entered the square with some trepidation. I try to remain calm as I entered the inn, and I see the young woman behind the bar. I took a deep breath and asked her for some of the supplies I need to live out on the beach. She looked up from preparing the food she was making to smile up at me, and said she could fill out what she could.<br/><br/>Her eyes sparkled like Karamia's when she smiled, you know the kind of smile, it lights up her face, and makes you feel like you are worth more gold than you will ever see in your lifetime. And her voice was soft and lilting...almost like a song on the wind. (Get a grip on yourself, man!) I tried to keep my eyes off of her, but her firm body and movements caught my eye as she brought out the items I was needing. <br/><br/>I think she may have thought I was interested in her as I tried not to be obvious in watching her. Her movements became more exaggerated, stretching to reach items within easy grasp, or bending over in front of me, emphasizing that firm and curvacious body for my benefit. And as I placed items in my bags, she touched my hand briefly asking me if I was interested in a hot breakfast.<br/><br/>I had to close my eyes to prevent myself from trembling as her soft hand touched my own. I briskly told her as much as I would like to, my time was short and I needed to go right away. And I swung my bag over my shoulder. She came from around the bar, and stood in front of me. She reached up to touch the runic scar on my left cheek, and looked into my eyes. Her lips were full and pouty (How did I miss that before?) as she told me to stop by again soon, and not to be a stranger. I practically ran from the inn and got on my mount and raced away.<br/><br/>I remember her soft touch, the heat I felt from the rune, and I knew I had come very close, too close. I will not be able to return again. I cannot afford to lose myself in my animalistic urges.<br/><br/>I am for one woman and one woman only - Karamia Dawnstr...Sunblaze, my beautiful wife. I will keep my vow, and keep my promise to her. She is the only woman I desire in my heart, and I long to hold her in my arms again, to smell her hair, and to feel her soft inviting lips on my own. Only Karamia will do, none other is worthy or pales in comparison to her smile, her touch, her love.
