<strong>[33+] Dangerously Cheesy</strong><br/><blockquote>The first story written about Aestaela Lightspark.<br/><strong>Age:</strong> 51 (Two years ago)</blockquote><br/><br/>He was an older man, his sable hair tinged silver at its edges - but it was quick work to deduce that age alone would never stop him. Though scarred and with a patch over one eye, his muscular frame bent and rippled with a grace that most men half his age would never achieve. He had dignity and poise. Most of it wasted in this occasion.<br/><br/>“Doctor Lightspark. Do you understand the importance of this matter?”<br/><br/>She was a white-haired gnome; a sprightly post-adolescent girl, with a practical ponytail and sensible (if well-cut) working robes. The slight chub in her face showed she ate well; when she smiled, one would be mistaken for thinking her a cherub. But right now, she merely rolled her eyes and idly fluffed out her ponytail with one hand.<br/><br/>“Well?”<br/><br/>She shrugged carelessly, closing her eyes in feigned indifference; in truth, she was racking her brain for a suitably witty rejoinder, scrambling to fire a one-liner before the moment of comedic timing passed. Heartbeats thumped out the time; on the seventh, she knew she'd lost the opportunity and inwardly sighed, keeping her disinterested facade. Staying on the top of her game was not easy.<br/><br/>The man gritted his teeth. His reputation had fallen hard if he had to resort to this. “Do you understand the words -”<br/><br/>Eureka! Comic inspiration. She hid the forming smile on her face by shaking her head in mock confusion, affecting a terrible Draenic accent. “Forget speak Common. Only talk Gold.” With a wave of her fingers, the gnome conjured an empty coin-purse into her open palm. “Trias speak many tongues, yes?”<br/><br/>“By the Light, you’re offensive. Fine, then.” He ripped a small bag off of his belt, the wallet noisy with the subtle clink of loose metals, and tossed it across the counter to the side. The bag slid halfway before finally tilting and spilling its gleaming contents across the wood.<br/><br/>“Ah, and by some great magic… Now I understand, Master of Cheese.” The gnome’s inward smile became a beaming, bright outward grin. “So you have paid me, and so shall it be done.”<br/><br/>“I hope so.” He raised one eyebrow as he evaluated her one last time. Bright scarlet and gold criss-crossed her clothes, flame dripped off of her quartz-tipped staff, and those dark eyes of hers constantly gleamed like there was some colossal joke that was about to hit its punchline – and you were in the punch trajectory. Subtle was not the word. Not the word at all.<br/><br/>Aestaela shook her head. “If you’re looking for hope, Cathedral District’s thataway. Hope’s not in the contract, honeybunch – just results.”

The barn was shady, if not dark – bright light filtered in through cracks here and there, giving enough to see by – not like the cows inside seemed to care much, though. They could see well enough already; the green felflames that had replaced their eyes covered the question of illumination handily. Their bovine mouths moved in odd synchronicity as they engaged in a communal chewing of the cud, with no other cares in the world. The rhythm was as soothing as it was subtly disturbing – a constant <em>chew, chew, chew</em> marked every event.<br/><br/>There was a ‘whump’ above, on the roof. “What the- who are you?” <em>Chew, chew, chew.</em><br/><br/>“Your worst nightm- ooh, elfboy, your uniform is torn in <strong>all </strong>the right places, huh? Y’know, I could be the right time for you to defect back to the Alliance…” <em>Chew, chew, chew</em>.<br/><br/>“Back off, gnome! Or I’ll-“ <em>Chew, chew, chew</em>.<br/><br/>“So cute! So dumb. So… elf.” Something popped, like the rush of wind through a tunnel, and then the elf screamed in horror. <em>Chew, chew… wait, what was tha- ah, chew it</em>.<br/><br/>Another popping noise heralded a hole being torn through the thatched roof – sunlight shot through the shaded barn, illuminating a circular patch of hay. A second later, a lithe, elven body went thudding down into that bright patch – an event commemorated by a sickening crack of the spine that ensured that there would be no further trouble from the boy. Next came Aestaela, gently floating to the ground as she was enveloped by a shaft of white sunlight, arms extended. In her head, she looked totally awesome. Probably. She'd have to start setting up cameras.<br/><br/><em>Chew, chew, chew. Stare at the curious red figure. Chew, chew, chew as she turns and smiles at all of us, pulling out a handful of darts. Chew, blink, blink. She just stabbed Bessie in the neck with that. And now Janice. Should I moov- ow! She stabbed me! Without even waiting for me to… hey, everything’s fuzzy and swirl-</em><br/><br/>One by one, the cows’ heads drooped, then their shoulders slumped, then they fell to the side with a colossal ‘thud’. A few seconds after that, the green in their eyes began to wane and dim. Aestaela spun around as she took quick mental note – not a one had been forgotten. Excellent. She reached into her belt and pulled out a small journal and feather quill, making some quick scribbles.<br/><br/>“Neutralizing agent and anesthetics put in… And… damnit. Just like I thought. He didn’t want me to kill any Sindorei.” She glanced over at the corpse a few yards away, then shrugged. “Oh well. The cows are still alive. Just leaves… ‘taking care of’ the existing tainted cheese. Hmm.”<br/><br/>“Not so fast, Alliance scum!” A raspy voice echoed through the shadows of the barn. “You thought you were clever. <strong>But we are cleverer</strong>. You thought you could hide in the barn. But we have <strong>also </strong>hidden in the barn. You thought you could succeed… but we have <strong>also </strong>succeeded! <strong>For we are Forsaken!</strong>”

Aestaela blinked, pausing for a moment - then she giggled, her voice like a chiming bell. “I’ve already completely ruined your plans and I killed every other guard I’ve met here with one spell apiece. You are going to do… what?”<br/><br/>There was an awkward pause as the Forsaken processed this information with a flicker in his unnatural eyes. She took the opportunity to spin around, searching for the source of the voice. Not in the stalls… not up at the roof… She strolled forward.<br/><br/>“I’m… going to…”<br/><br/>“Oh, c’mon, sweetie.” She grinned as she checked off another corner. There were only a handful of places he could still be hiding. “You were doing so well with the melodrama! Was it your first time? I could tell, but even so, such promise! Ah- ha- boo!” <br/><br/>There he was! With a cry of victory, she spun towards the final corner and launched a double-handed blazing bolt. An pillar of flame shot from both hands and exploded in glorious orange across the wood and straw as a small, bony figure ran screaming out, dropping to the ground. Aestaela watched with an expression of amused triumph as he flailed and writhed about frantically, especially as he squirmed to beat out the lingering flame at the bottom of his exposed rib cage. After a bit of this, she blew on her nails and polished them with the corner of one sleeve, buffing them one by one before looking back up. The zombie form before her was burned and in something of a crumpled heap, but not irreparable.<br/><br/>“Impressive. Now… let me try that again with a slight temperature improvement. I always did like brighter colors so much better.”<br/><br/>He groaned and spat on the ground beneath, a green, sickly mucus that seeped into the earth. “Get your kicks in while you can now, gnome. The rest of my group is coming. I have a beacon out on this location. And I’m a runt next to the-“<br/><br/>A popping noise interrupted – then he was silenced by a bolt of white flame that receded to show only a massive hole in the wooden wall.<br/><br/>“Not only are the cute ones stupid, but the ugly ones are smart! Why must the Horde do everything backwards?!” She grit her teeth and sprinted forward through the gaping hole, into a bright pastoral field. The grain silo was up ahead… the crops to the side… and… aha! The nondescript wooden building on the other side of the pasture. That had to be it.<br/><br/>She scythed her hand forwards, projecting a wide, flat arc of flame that burned a broad path through the wheat rows ahead. A light grey smoke rose into the sky – it’d attract more attention, but the wheat was also now at gnome-waist height. Much more navigable. Aestaela broke into a dead run across the grain field, pushing what stalks remained out of her way as she tumbled through.<br/><br/>The fel cheese had to be made obviously unsuitable for consumption, Trias had said, or they might smuggle some into Darnassus and Theramore anyway. The last thing the Alliance wanted was more magic-addicted elves. She touched the small vial on her belt. With enough time, she could replicate the neutralizing agent sufficiently to negate all of the unsorted curd. But time was no longer an option…

«Fan out and search,» an olive-skinned orc – a Mag'har, an increasingly common sight these days – barked out to the rest of his team. All five of them were muscular, lean. Their metals gleamed with the dull sheen of effective if well-worn smithwork; their leathers had the creases of use but the polish of military care.<br/><br/>A troll hooted with wry laughter. «Nothing in the barn, Blood Guard. ‘cept the remains of Scout Gravely.» She pulled the bow off of her back and sighted it. «Not like he were anything but remains to begin with if you feel me.»<br/><br/>The Blood Guard scowled. «He died a warrior’s death against the treacherous Alliance. They lack honor, but the ferocity of the dwarves and elves is not to be underestimated, nor the cunning of the humans and draenei. Do not diminish his passing. At Hammerfall tonight, we shall sing praises of his- Did you hear something?»<br/><br/>The ground beneath them rumbled, and the two of them looked at the blue-eyed Tauren to the distance, who merely shrugged quietly.<br/><br/>The orc stroked at his chin thoughtfully for a moment. «The spirits. Allow my mate a moment to speak with them.» Then he nodded to his right, at a slightly smaller, jade-skinned orc in a feathered headdress. She nodded back in understanding and began to chant, crushing incense in her right hand.<br/><br/>The ground rumbled again. Before another word could be said, the wooden building in distance exploded utterly, replaced with formless off-white glop and an overpowering stench. In the blink of an eye, the entire farmstead – wheat fields, barn, silo, and the Horde squad – was blanketed in warm, gooey curd. At the same time, a small figure shot through the air overhead, screaming gnomish profanity at six hundred miles per hour.<br/><br/>“I win again, motorfreakers! I-” was all which she managed to get out before she was just a distant dot in the sky. The five merely stared at one another for a good, long moment.<br/><br/>«…I was… not expecting that.» The Tauren blinked his glowing blue eyes, then gingerly licked his chops, taking the stringy substance into his mouth. «Curiously tasty.» <em>Chew, chew, chew</em>.<br/><br/><strong>[33] Dangerously Cheesy (Complete)</strong><br/><br/> <blockquote>Felt like writing a new story, but I wanted to find this old one first so I'd have a better handle on the characters - wow, Aestaela's matured in the two years since! Not sure yet if the next one's going to be about Aestaela herself, the H-Team, or a new character.</blockquote>

<strong>[68+] IDK, My BFF Jill?</strong><br/><blockquote>The second story about Aestaela Lightspark.<br/><strong>Age:</strong> 52 (one year ago)</blockquote><br/><br/> She was little more than a silhouette against the distant sun – black robes, black hat, black scarf. Two tiny red embers winked out of her eyesockets, illuminating the few strands of white hair that dared stray back to her face. The wide-brimmed conical hat sunk low over her face, shielding it from the penetrating sunlight – that searing white light that poured across the brown tundra and swallowed it whole. Thin, wispy steam slowly rose from her mouth and her eyes, mingling together beneath the brim before vaguely sauntering upwards.<br/><br/> “Magistrix Lightspark?” Three turquoise shapes ambled behind her, metal and scales clanking together. She could feel their presence in the ley – most swum through the weave, whether or not they knew it. They brought the weave with them, the invisible knots and cords catching hold of their souls and following them until the magic would strain and snap back.<br/><br/> She turned to face them, the gentle motions twisting the steam away from her. “I prefer the term, ‘Doctor.’ It’s so much less superstitious, don’t you think?” Not that you could see it beneath the scarf, but she smirked just a bit as she evaluated her greeters – two of the ugly four-legged abominations and a wrinkled, scarred old man, his face crisscrossed by dark lines.<br/><br/> The man uttered. He didn’t speak; the voice was slurred, his lips out of sync. But he uttered. “We have come for you. You know of the arrangements.”<br/><br/> “Yeah.” She reached for the black scepter on her back; on either end it was crowned with a white pearl surrounded by a red flame.<br/><br/> “And you are resisting.” The puppet’s voice was anything but surprised.<br/><br/> The smirk became a titter, like a tinkling bell. “Damn right, motorfreakers.”<br/><br/><blockquote><em> A small, turquoise cube emblazoned with a half-dozen runes and sigils, crystals embedded in each face. A precise, vertical stroke of flame shot through it, leaving a perfect diagonal slice. One half slid down, and the entire cube collapsed.<br/><br/> “Ach… me ‘ead…”</em></blockquote><br/><br/> The drakonids rushed her – how, she could never understand. They didn’t have the right shape for fast movement. Axes raised, they darted across. A flash of light winked from her eyes and she shot up in mid-air as axes became ploughshares, rending the ground. Flame surged in her heart, but she fought it down. Murderers! Axes. Hands.<br/><br/> She twisted the staff over head, white flame collecting at the ends, shimmering purple. And then she brought it down like… a skyhammer.<br/><br/><blockquote><em> “You idiot! They didn’t want anything to do with you!” The gnome threw herself across the still warm, but bloodied and gaunt frame, her head resting on a ragged, scarred bosom.<br/><br/> “Th’ Light… wanted me… to ‘ave somethin’ t’do wid ‘em…”</em></blockquote>

Twin missiles erupted from the ends of her weapon, and as she thudded to the ground, so too did four reptilian hands and two battleaxes. She turned back to face the puppet, his hands raised with one before the other. Second velocity, third stance. She kicked upwards, a bolt of magic arcing from her foot to his throat, forging itself into a violet collar. He clutched and clawed at it, gasping for air.<br/><br/> She took the satisfaction of a smug smirk before a solid wave of blue cracked her across the stomach and sent her sprawling, rolling backwards across frozen grass that cut her face and robes. Her hat wafted to the ground beside her.<br/><br/><blockquote><em> “What the bellcurve were you- scratch that, I know you don’t think! Ugh! C’mon!” The gnome leapt off the dwarf’s chest and wrapped her arms around the head, tugging.<br/><br/> The dwarf laughed softly, wincing. “Ach, ye gotta ‘urt me e’en in me last moments? Me ‘ead don’t move that way no more.”</em></blockquote><br/><br/> She shot back up, planting her staff into the ground like a thunderbolt. Flame sundered the earth, racing back towards the drakonids and then exploding upwards, purifying blue in glorious red, once and for all.<br/><br/> “Damn, I love the smell of bacon in the evening.” She laughed – no, howled, and darted forward even as the puppet raised his hands. Azure light poured forth from his palms – yet still muted in the inexorable sunset. White flame leapt from the smouldering corpses and wrapped itself around her.<br/><br/> Fear gripped his eyes as ice rained from his fingertips, melting harmlessly half an inch from the gnome’s skin. “Malygos will n-“<br/><br/> “Shh. Don’t ruin the moment, darling.” A white meteor coalesced at her palm and streaked forward. She polevaulted up, punching a gout of flame with her other hand, both impacting at once, blowing off one leg at the knee and disintegrating an arm from the shoulder down. His mouth went wide with agony… and then he tumbled face-forward.<br/><br/> “Instant cauterization, free when you buy the farm, motorfreakin’ traitorous jacknape.”<br/><br/> Hatred kept him conscious. Let him see her feet shuffling through the grass. Stopping in front of him – that cold hand placed atop his forehead. Something hissed and crackled nearby. Right over his ear?<br/><br/><blockquote><em> “Why?”</em></blockquote><br/><br/>“What… are you…”<br/><br/>“I hear puppets are very good at giving answers. Let’s test that hypothesis.”<br/><br/><blockquote><em>“…Because, lass. ‘at gnome coulda been ye.”</em></blockquote><br/><br/><em>Requiescat In Pace – Gillian Skyhammer</em><br/><br/><strong>[68+] IDK, My BFF Jill? (Complete)</strong><br/><br/> <blockquote>Gillian was a Aestaela's best friend, an RAF dummy I explained away as being a not-too-bright Paladin who'd been Taelie's babysitter when she was younger. Eventually, Aestaela became a far superior combatant, and Gillian was left cooling her heels in Azeroth while Taelie went to study ruins in Outland. <br/><br/>Remember the gnome who gives you the quest to find the Amber Ledge? She looks a lot like Aestaela did back then, which inspired me to come up with this explanation for Gillian's complete disappearance from Aestaela's side.</blockquote>

<strong>[??] Gnomeboys </strong><br/><blockquote>It's a war of words.</blockquote><br/>Normally, one would say that Aestaela was a singular, unique creature; her cream-colored hair in its flirty yet mature bob, the confident smirk on her lips, and the more measured, weathered rings around her eyes. You could usually spot her and her fashions from halfway across a city; there was no mistaking her for someone else. <br/><br/>Normally.<br/><br/>This time was different; this time there were in fact two of her, with her distinct dress and appearance, standing next to one another. "Turn around," one of them instructed the other – and the other did comply. The former one looked over her doppelganger, examined every inch of her hair; finding a few strands in the rear out of place, she drew her brush out and stroked at that spot on her own head. At the same time, the hair on the model moved by mysterious forces, and in just a few motions, the out-of-place strands were no longer an issue.<br/><br/>"Dismissed," she called out, and the model Aestaela became nothing more than an ornate hand mirror on the ground, decorated in the Kaldorei style. She picked up the mirror and stuffed it into her purse, then looked up. She'd been waiting at the tram station for five minutes already; looking up at the electronic board overhead, she saw that the train was reading as delayed.<br/><br/>She groaned. "That’s what I get for deciding to take things the mundane way for once," she muttered to herself. At least the place was mostly empty; she didn't have to deal with anyone else. "Wonder whom screwed things up this time."<br/><br/>"Actually, you mean 'who' screwed things up this time, lass. Saying 'whom' doesn't just sound pretentious, it's also wrong in this case." The responder was a chocolate-skinned dwarf of full and luxurious beard (like all male dwarves, basically), with a twinkle in his eyes and a nice grey Haliscan suit. "Relax. There's no reason to be in a rush all the time, lass."<br/><br/>Aestaela sniffed disdainfully. Great. Corrected by some knot-bearded old fogey. "Look, it's not that I don't appreciate you, but if you could leave me alone? That'd be great, too." Then she turned on her heel, expecting that to be the end of it. <br/><br/>"Not the first I've seen to make that very same mistake. I'm good with words, I'm no fake; accept you're wrong and move on." His eyes seemed to twinkle just that extra bit more. The gnome shook her head, suppressing a smile. Was he… rhyming? She looked straight forward into the dark tunnel ahead, speaking without looking.<br/><br/>"So you say, say you so; but just hang on for a mo'.<br/>You might be right with grammar tonight, although-<br/>You got the structure, have you the flow? No,<br/>No go,<br/>You're just an average Joe. Put your words<br/>In a box and leave 'em there;<br/>I'm a master of speech, any and everywhere."<br/><br/>The dwarf's eyebrows raised and he stroked and his beard; boots clomped as he made his way up to the edge of the platform, and then he cleared his throat with a great harrumph.<br/><br/>"Little lass, I wonder, at what game do you play?<br/>Wishing on a star, every night and day,<br/>Wishing you might, wishing you may?<br/>An un-Common master is about to teach you a lesson,<br/>You do not understand with whom you are messin',<br/>But allow me to show you-"<br/><br/>Just as he reached into his pocket as if to withdraw something, Aestaela twirled about on the platform, hands on her hips, and interjected:<br/><br/>"Not just a word Smith, I'm also a word-Wesson,<br/>Let me put on a dress - call me Paletress,<br/>And start confessin'<br/>In hopes of my blessin'.<br/>I'm MC Aestael-a, hope I don't fail-ya<br/>School's in, I win, you sin,<br/>So praise be to this little gnomey-"<br/><br/>She pointed her finger into the air as if mimicking a preacher at a sermon, and drew a deep breath as – he launched into the next line pre-emptively.<br/><br/>"-Even though you're homely. It must be lonely,<br/>Being an ugly phoney, riding about<br/>On an ugly little pony.<br/>Oh please don't pout,<br/>Cry, stammer or shout.<br/><br/>I know when you do, you whiny little shrew-<br/>Doesn't take Greatfather Winter,<br/>Just a dwarf from the Hinters,<br/>To hear you go ga-ga, goo-goo.<br/> <br/>You're better than I thought<br/>But your lines are overwrought<br/>The battle's been fought,<br/>It was a good fight-<br/>But it's good night."<br/><br/>Before Aestaela could say anything else, she found herself suddenly drowned out by the violent screeching of metal on metal; the dwarf merely smiled genially and nodded towards the tram pulling up behind her.<br/><br/>"Well done. Good timing."<br/><br/>"I know." <br/><br/><strong>[??] Gnomeboys (Failed)</strong><br/><br/><blockquote>Not as happy with this as I wanted to be, but it's a basic idea I had in mind and I wanted to do something more light-hearted/a loss for Aestaela.</blockquote>

<blockquote>One of the many stories in an ongoing storyline about Blood Magic.</blockquote><br/><br/><strong>[60] Hemotherapy</strong><br/><br/>Two gnomes in a dark cave. One was male, and he seemed to be in his mid-200s - but his eyes were wrinkled with time that spoke of ages far past that. His name was Kasim Sharim* and he was not quite unkempt, but he was hardly kempt, either. His beard - all of his hair - was long, bushy and speckled with dots of a dark, dried substance; his clothes were clean but frayed by the seasons. Right now, Kasim Sharim bore the most infuriating smile on his face.<br/><br/>"I could crush you," were the words from the other gnome. This one was female, not even sixty. Her eyes were focused, sharp; her painted lips were drawn into a thin line of displeasure. The bobbed white hair beneath her hood had been brushed with the most meticulous care, and pale blond highlights had been added here and there for effect. Aestaela Lightspark.<br/><br/>Small spherical vials of a crimson, viscous fluid hung from each of his earlobes. Her ears, by contrast, were adorned with platinum hoops lovingly crafted by Tiffany Cartier. <br/><br/>"You could. But you would not dare," he answered. "And even if you would, I do not care." Then he waved her off, as if to say that she was dismissed.<br/><br/>She did not move. "Why?"<br/><br/>"To have seen the things I've seen, to have done the things I've done, and to still breathe... I am a lucky gnome. If fortune decrees that I join Thalipedes**, then so be it. You shall never discern the name of our accomplice."<br/><br/>Her face screwed up in rage and she drew herself up to full height, screaming at the wizened gnome. "They are a danger to the Alliance, Sharim! You introduced someone to forbidden rites. <em>You</em> must be brought back to Nethergarde to stand trial, and <em>they</em> must be inspected by the Kirin Tor."<br/><br/>The infuriating smile did not move except to grow wider still, showing off the older gnome's discolored teeth before he spoke again. "It truly is funny; everywhere I go, you sanctimonious twits are all the same. Raze'likh is imprisoned forever, no innocents were harmed, but it was not done the way you wanted it to be done so I must suffer further for the sacrifices I have made. You must have been one of the nincompoops who believed Malygos."<br/><br/>Aestaela's voice dropped dangerously quiet. "What the hell did you just say?"<br/><br/>He whistled. "Touch a nerve, did-"<br/><br/>She lunged forward, gripping him by his collar and slamming him against the wooden post headfirst. "You don't know me, you don't know anything about me, you son of a lich, so you shut your-"<br/><br/>"Realization of hypocrisy hurts, doesn't it? Come in here parading around with your fancy ring-" he glanced at the amethyst on her finger, emblazoned with the Eye of Dalaran, "-riding around on your fancy hippogryph and then you realize that you're <em>just like them</em>, ready to execute someone who doesn't agree with you. That is what you meant when you said you'd crush me, isn't it?"<br/><br/>"Shut up! Shut up!" She screamed so hard in his face, spittle flew out of her mouth. She slammed her hands into his chest further, making the old gnome wheeze with pain. "Just shut up!"<br/><br/>"Say it, don't spray it. If you're going to kill me, just go ahead and get it over with." Kasim Sharim closed his eyes and waited. But after a few seconds, all he felt was his own body being released. He paused for a few more heartbeats to slowly take his next breath - then made a show of brushing himself off before opening his eyes again.<br/><br/>Aestaela stood only a scant few inches from him, her cheeks stained with wet rage as she leaned heavy against her staff.<br/><br/>Kasim looked down to straighten out his robes a few more times before speaking. "See? I told you that you would not dare. I read you like a book; you kids are always so predicta-"<br/><br/>"Teach me," she said between ragged breaths.<br/><br/>"-bull?" He blinked and stepped backwards, stroking his beard. "Where in the blazes did that come from?" <blockquote/>

"I am a scientist. I make <em>informed </em>decisions." Her words were cold, her breath steadying. "If your magic is corruptive, then I will kill you and submit myself to judgment. If it is not, then we shall see where to proceed from there."<br/><br/>"Ah, I know the look in your eyes now. The look of one who has forbidden herself study, hungry for knowledge..." Kasim tugged at his beard. "Yes, but not for your flimsy reasons. You are what births demon consorters. The lid has been blown, so to speak, and if I release you to the wider world without guidance, than I truly will have done evil."<br/><br/>Aestaela shot straight up back into a sneer. "I am not some novice who would fall to demonology so easily-" <br/><br/>Kasim just continued speaking over her. "Your first lesson-"<br/><br/>"-I have resisted the call of temptation for years without budging! I am resistant, even though-"<br/><br/>He rose his voice.

<blockquote>One of the many stories in an ongoing storyline about Blood Magic.</blockquote><br/><br/><strong>[60] Bloody Hell</strong><br/><br/>One thing which Aestaela Lightspark would never publicly admit was that she liked to be tied up. For all the most base and vulgar reasons which might come to mind, too. It was a frequent thought tossed about in her head. Reality, however, often has a way of having a sharp disconnect with one's fantasies.<br/><br/>Her fantasies, for example, tended not to involve a rust-red cave in the middle of the Blasted Lands, a place where either your eyes burned from the strain of staring at bright orange, or your skin crawled from imagining how many little batlings were crawling around in your unmentionables because you couldn't see to be sure that that creeping feeling up your arm wasn't just your imagination. <br/><br/>Right now the gnome was strapped upside-down, hanging from the ceiling on a stalactite. Beads of sweat rolled down her brow, dripping one by one into the brazier below, which exchanged a copious amount of dusky smoke in return for each drop it was fed. Her eyes were bloodshot with irritation. Her face was red, too - almost as red as the rock from all the blood rushing to her head. Only half of that was because she was upside-down - the other half was because she was screaming at the top, at the bottom, left and right of her little lungs. "Let me down right now you creepy old cog!"<br/><br/>"No." The long-haired, middle-aged gnome beneath her and beside the flame kept his face shadowed so she could only imagine - not see for sure - the smile on his face. He licked one dirt-stained finger and tugged at the page of his book. His name was Kasim Sharim, and he was a Blood Mage. But where some preferred elaborate robes of scarlet and gold with the finest livery in their residences, Kasim lived the life of a hermit.<br/><br/>"I have been up here for three hours! What is even the motorfreakin' point of this cruft?" She squirmed, kicking her feet up to strain against the ceiling - to little avail. She couldn't get enough traction to push herself out of the tight rope. <br/><br/>"You have no good reading material at all," he sighed and tossed the thick tome away into the corner, along with a pile of Aestaela's other books and an improbably small bag beside them. They were all emblazoned with golden letters pronouncing their titles: "Tome of Polymorph XIX: A Dissertation on Mass Application," "Conjure Water: A Theoretical History," "An Examination on Radioactivity," and the like. <br/><br/>She'd had enough. "Taeshalach," she muttered and gave a sharp nod of her head. Fire slammed down from above into a spot three inches to the left of Kasim's hip and left only a semi-molten crater.<br/><br/>If Kasim was perturbed, he didn't show it, only crossing his arms over his chest and staring forward.<br/><br/>"I missed on purpose."<br/><br/>"I know."<br/><br/>"Next time I won't."<br/><br/>"As you say."<br/><br/>"I've tolerated this cruft for three hours. I deserve an answer. This has nothing to do with practicing my non-magical escape skills, and we both know it." She tilted her head to stare down at him as fully as she could muster; somehow, he seemed to know this and turned to reciprocate the gesture. "You put me up here and tell me that I cannot use magic to get free, so how the bellcurve is this teaching me anything about magic? And I swear if you're going to spout some crap about life lessons..."<br/><br/>Kasim shrugged. "You could consider it that, I suppose-"<br/><br/>"Son of a-"

"All magic corrupts," he continued, closing his eyes. "All magic corrupts because all power corrupts. The theory that the Twisting Nether's energies are inherently special is just that - a theory. Shamans, Druids, Paladins - they are all actively or philosophically beholden on other beings to gain their abilities. For us, there is only a damned silence which grows ever more wretched, and for some, only monologues and diabolical laughing can fill the void."<br/><br/>Kasim stood up and opened his eyes, pacing around the cave like a lecturer now. His shadow danced aft and afore of him, as the whimsy of the flickering flames chose. "The more you use magic casually, the more you become aware that you are the only one in the void. I can conjure my meals - but I hunt for food with blade. I can light this room with a snap of my fingers - but I use tinder and flint. I add my own blood as a reagent not to make my spells easier, but to remind myself of the sacrifice which must be wrought to do the works I do."<br/><br/>"You think I haven't learned these things? I was in Northrend, Sharim. I saw war. I fought Death Knights." The hate in her voice at those last two words - it was palpable. The brazier's flame shivered shadows all across the rocky alcove. "I know what it is like to be without magic. I know it in the worst way. I have been helpless when I needed it most."<br/><br/>He stood still now, staring at Aestaela from behind - knowing that she could not see him, only hear his voice resounding through the small hollow. "I could have bound your magic. But helplessness breeds corruption in those freed from its bonds. You must learn patience; you must learn to restrain your own power when it is not necessary. And it is not necessary; you are a gnome. We have talent in escaping such things."<br/><br/>"Damn right I'm a gnome." Her chest swelled a little bit with pride.<br/><br/>Kasim stroked his beard thoughtfully and hobbled towards the back corner of the cave where he kept the ladder. "But I suppose this level of challenge was just a bit much for you off the b-"<br/><br/>Aestaela's voice stopped him short. "Bugger off, Sharim. I got this." <br/><br/>The older gnome shook his head and took a seat - frowning openly for the first time since she had arrived. Appealing to her pride. It made her easier to control. That was not necessarily a good thing.<br/><br/><strong>[60] Bloody Hell (Complete)</strong><br/><strong>Quest Accepted: Thicker than Water.</strong>

<strong>[60] Thicker than Water</strong><br/><br/>The color of death is something which varies from culture to culture, in contradiction to what many might believe. Black echoes the cavernous shadows of the Earth which reclaims all of the wayward sons and daughters of Khaz Modan. The children of the stars, of the blood and up high vary in many ways - some embrace the blackness, others shun it - but all see the white of winter as the end of their many seasons. The lost of Argus, they see red; the red of their own shed blood, many times over. Red as the flesh of demons which pursue them. Red as the rock on which their tears fall.<br/><br/>The gnomes? They choose green.<br/><br/>Green as the plants which criss-cross their shallow graves, a striking contrast to the metals with which they surround themselves in life. Green as the poison which gently lulls about their home, sapping the strength, mind and spirit of their people. Green as the face of their cousins' murderers. Green as the plague which seeps through deadened halls of old allies. <br/><br/>Green as the dress which Aestaela Lightspark wore on this dark night, atop a grassy grave in Stormwind. Her white-blonde hair was done up in tight, somber buns and secured carefully with ribbons - the effect was to make her both look younger and older at the same time. Someone who desperately wanted to be smaller than she was, but could not help to be older than she deserved. Aestaela pushed her thick-rimmed glasses up on her nose and leaned forward to read the decorative tombstone - hoping that perhaps she had misread it, that she was at the wrong grave. But no, the stony truth remained before her:<br/><br/> <strong>Gigaflop "Jiggles" Lightspark<br/>Alchemist, Artist, Altruist<br/>Lost in the Scourge of Lordaeron</strong><br/><br/>"I'm sorry, Mommy," Aestaela whispered.<br/><br/>A voice behind her cleared his throat. "Time is of the essence. That potion I concocted for the groundsman will not keep him out of it very long."<br/><br/>"I know, damnit." <br/><br/>"Well, then stop talking and start working." The voice belonged to a middle-aged gnome behind her, in the clean but worn cloth of an occasionally meticulous hermit. He had a shovel in his grasp and was leaning upon another; his name was Kasim Sharim, and he was - for the moment - her master. Kasim stood up straight and handed Aestaela her shovel.<br/><br/>To begin the path of blood magic, there must always be an element of grave sacrifice invoked. More than just the sweat and tears which fell from the faces of the two gnomes as they worked in silent and swift unison, unearthing the corpse beneath the headpiece.<br/><br/>A metallic clang signaled paydirt; it was something like a macabre gong, signaling Aestaela's commencement. She stopped there, hunched over her shovel, not ready to heft another load just yet. Kasim's hand found its way onto her shoulder and squeezed lightly.<br/><br/>"I promise, her spirit will not be harmed in any way. The magic needs to fully recognize what and how you have suffered before it will accept you into its mysteries. That is all we require - her body."<br/><br/>She stood very still for a moment and drew a long breath. "How do I know you're not lying?"<br/><br/>"Excuses do not become you." His voice grew harsh and the hand withdrew. "You want knowledge, you want power, and you want these for fine reasons. For knowledge's sake! To defend your people! But commendable greed remains greed, and you must be willing to accept the consequences! Do not shift them onto-"<br/><br/>Kasim was cut short by a hard left hook to the jaw; in a second, he was on the ground beneath an apparently towering woman, trembling with rage. "I get it, okay? You think you're so smart and that you know everything. You don't know anything!"<br/><br/>"As you say," he muttered through a cut lip, raising his hands to signal surrender. And then, lower, too soft for her to hear: "So predictable."<br/><br/>She scowled through her thick glasses and swiveled on her heel before turning that scowl on herself; her nice dress was covered in sweat and dirt, but that was alright. Showing up in proper clothes was the least she could do for her mother.<br/><br/>The rest of the digging occurred with little incident; soon enough, the piles of dirt on either side had grown high and the coffin was almost completely exposed. Aestaela had seen it when it had gone into the ground - a shiny metal box with levers and gears to lower and raise itself and automatically lock. Just the sort of thing her mother would have loved. In the years since, though, the pressure of the dirt had forced the steel to cave in... leaving the coffin a crushed and crumpled heap of machinery, with strands of pernicious roots weaving through.<br/><br/>Aestaela could see bone. She turned away and held her stomach gently.<br/><br/>"That one piece will do," Kasim said quietly. The long-haired gnome shuffled forward and gripped the stained white piece before yanking it out with a surprising strength born of age and will. "We should leave now, before we are seen."

"No," Aestaela responded, standing up straight as she did so - still, she looked away from Kasim. "Give the groundskeeper another dose. Keep him under."<br/><br/>The older gnome tugged at his beard thoughtfully. "It might kill him. That's strong stuff we're talking about."<br/><br/>"The odds are very low."<br/><br/>Kasim shrugged. "Not as low as I'd like."<br/><br/>"I'm not leaving until this grave is made right again, Sharim." Aestaela locked her eyes with his.<br/><br/>"...Very well."<br/><br/><strong>[60] Thicker than Water (complete)<br/>Quest accepted: A Sanguine Start</strong>

<blockquote>Part 4 of the on-going Blood Magic story, starring the player character Aestaela Lightspark and the minor NPC Kasim Sharim.</blockquote><br/><br/>Kasim Sharim had discarded many of the ways of his people, the gnomes; he lived in solitary squalor, he did not tinker, and he prized silent study over active discussion. But some things are simply tradition; it did not matter if one was in a city or a cave. There was a plain black trunk in the back of the rocky alcove he called home; it was coated in thin, rusty-orange dust that the wind had blown off of the matching stone which made up these blasted lands.<br/><br/>Leaning forward, Kasim pulled his worn, raggedy robe overhead and off his body, leaving him in burlap longjohns. The skin at the edges of his wrists and ankles, where the burlap stopped, were tinged red with irritation. Then he balled up the robe and swabbed off the dust from the chest with it. He would wash that off later; for now, keeping the trunk's contents clean mattered most. He allowed himself a genuine smile for once - only a little one - as he popped the lock open.<br/><br/>Inside was a simple off-white labcoat, folded neatly. The very occasional fray here and there at the edges and the nearly spotless (save for stained wrists) breadth of the cloth said that this was an item which was almost like new - but that it had gotten that way by being very old and in the care of someone who tried very hard to deny reality its due. <br/><br/>He slipped it on with only a slight pause of recalled memories. Beneath the labcoat was a simple stone knife, which Kasim took in hand and slipped into his pocket. And then he turned around towards his one student; she sat before a table at the mouth of their cave, the Serpent's Coil. She too wore a labcoat, a blinding white one well-cut for her body. It was immaculate. Every gnome who had ever gone as far into magic as she or he knew how it worked. But there would be... differences for the blood mage.<br/><br/>The table at which Aestaela Lightspark was seated held four very narrow glass beakers. One contained her mother's fingerbone; she no longer shuddered when she looked at it. In its own way, that worried her. The second held red fluid which occasionally bubbled and pulsed with latent energy: the blood of basilisks, those she had slain last night. The third and fourth were empty.<br/><br/>Kasim stepped forward, all the way to the table. Anticipation made it seem a very long walk, but the small globes of blood which hung from his ears continually tugged him forward. He ran a finger along the edge of the knife in his pocket.<br/><br/>"Blood is life. Life is struggle. Struggling against suffering. Suffering ends only with death."<br/><br/>Aestaela knotted her brows and stared up at him, but Kasim waved her off and she bit her tongue. For the moment.<br/><br/>"But all ends with death. All systems decay to entropy. Entropy is the nature of reality. Life is an aberration. Magic is an aberration. Life is magic. Blood is life. Magic is suffering. Blood is magic. All that we do is unnatural; take pride in defying nature and accept the consequences which may come. They are the penalty we pay for the service which we render. We accept the suffering of life. We all-" He jabbed his pointer finger at Aestaela's coat before pointing back at his own, "Begin pure... and we shall only end faded." <br/><br/>"I accept the consequences. I've already paid many of them." Aestaela cut in, her voice strong.<br/><br/>"You are accepting many more," he cautioned. A final warning.<br/><br/>"They are burdens I would have accepted anyway. I would at least prefer to reap the benefits at the same time."<br/><br/>"Then present me your wrist, and do not flinch, do not waver." Kasim said with the slightest note of pride in his voice. It was buried deep beneath so many more layers of worry, but it was there if one cared to look enough.<br/><br/>Aestaela brought her left hand forward, over the first beaker. Kasim withdrew the stone dagger from his pocket and took a deep breath. Such a blunt weapon required speed and strength that age slowly robbed from him. He exhaled and then slashed upwards, cutting horizontally across the arm. Aestaela hissed with pain but did not move. She only watched her life mingle with the bone of her dead mother.

"Body and blood taken from you," Kasim said with a gesture at the first beaker.<br/><br/>"Blood taken by you." He tapped the second.<br/><br/>"Blood given to you." Kasim raised his knife over the third, and scythed it down over his own wrist, letting out an anguished howl. Feeling the hot life seep down the skin and into the vial.<br/><br/>Master and student rested in mirrored image, watching themselves drip into glass. There was silence once more for several minutes, fractured by the odd deep breath. Once Kasim had judged that enough blood had been removed, he withdrew his wrist. Aestaela followed suit.<br/><br/>Then he took each beaker by the mouth and poured them into the final beaker. Bone and blood, one by one, the viscous fluids running together with disgusting sloth, until there was only one full of blood.<br/><br/>Kasim held that one up by the rim. "Drink. Be sorrowful. Be somber. And for all our sakes, be merry. Bear your suffering well."<br/><br/><em>to be continued...</em>
