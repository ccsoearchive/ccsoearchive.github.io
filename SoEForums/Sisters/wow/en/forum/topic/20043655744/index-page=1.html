To read the existing lore and other stories, please visit <strong>www.housedawnbringer.com</strong>. This is the conclusion of one RP chapter our guild did on Emerald Dream, before moving here. It was done with a human guild there at the time known as Kingdom of Arathor. Our story continues on this server several months after the conclusion of this.<br/> <br/><br/><strong><span class="underline">The Red Dawn</span><br/></strong><br/><br/>Part I<br/><br/><strong>T</strong>wo days had passed since the attack by the human forces of Arathor against Dawnbringer Keep, situated on a lonely island some way south of the former human kingdom of Lordaeron. Memorial services were to be carried out for those that fell in the attack two days before, later in the morning. Many were trying to get back to their daily lives, but the atmosphere around the keep was one of mourning and concern. Many elves had lost someone they loved, or someone they knew in the attack. It felt like the blood of their kin was still wet on the soil of the courtyard.<br/><br/>Sentries were on alert, constantly on patrol and stationed throughout the Keep. To make matters worse, all communication with their sister settlement across the lake in New Alah’dorei had ceased, and their dispatch riders hadn’t made their last return trip. Many feared that the settlement was taken by Arathorian forces on their westerly conquest. The day before, Lord-Commander Silversworn made it clear he did not want to risk more elves to find out their fate, when their own fate was so uncertain. He knew that he would need every single person capable of fighting in the times ahead. Many of his scouts and sentries were battle-hardened after all of the fighting and struggles they endured. Many still longed for their home of Alah’dorei in Quel’thalas, the abundant land and ever greens, back before the scourge came. <br/><br/><em>That was a different time, in a much different place…</em><br/><br/>House Dawnbringer, its remaining military forces, and its citizens now found themselves in a ravaged, nearly inhospitable land, far from their home, possibly surrounded by an enemy far greater in number than they. What was once seen as an advantage, being surrounded by water on the island, seemed to turn into a natural prison. Even their farmland settlements to the East in the foothills were unsafe and likely overrun by the humans.<br/><br/>Scout-Captain Lamaenel Lightblade had been in talks with Lady Sephariel over whether to make plans for their escape. If they were to become overwhelmed, surely all would be lost. She was granted permission to begin construction on small vessels to assist their people with an exit from the Island on the northern side. Her thinking was that if some could make it to the forsaken capital now known as the Undercity, they may find some refuge through their mutual affiliation with the Horde. After all, Sephariel and her people were allowed to settle at the keep in the first place as a temporary solution, until she was able to clear up her business with the leadership in Quel’thalas. Sephariel secretly hoped that the forsaken may come to their aid, but she knew there was a good chance the forsaken would just as easily leave them to die. <br/><br/>Since her House’s self-exile from Quel’thalas, when she learned of Lor’themar Theron’s ascension to Lord-Regent, she found herself with few allies, and politically speaking, she knew that the forsaken may find themselves on shaky ground if Silvermoon found out they were aiding her. She missed the security and stability of her true King, Anasterian Sunstrider and viewed the Lord-Regent as a traitor for not advocating for a council to determine the rightful heir to the throne, after Prince Kael’thas’ betrayal. After all,<em> it was their way</em>, she thought. All of this led to where they are now. She knew her people deserved better. It was always in the back of her mind, and she would flirt with the idea of returning home often just to give them that opportunity, despite her own views on those in power. <br/><br/>Lady Sephariel was in attendance at the memorial service, though she did not speak herself. She noticed most able to make it, but did not see the Lord-Commander present. After inquiring with a few of her advisors, no one knew where he was. Most considered he may be grieving on his own. It would be his way to do that. The Lord-Commander was a loner by nature, and did not speak much. The memorial was a somber occasion, filled with tears, and small speeches of remembrance of the departed.<em> I’ve been involved in too many of these</em>, Sephariel thought to herself. She felt scared inside, but knew that no one could be allowed to see that. She had to do her duty, just as her father before her, and his father before him.

The bodies were arranged in two rows from the gateway of the keep, to the steps leading up to the keep itself. Each was adorned with symbolic items, placed there by family members, and other cherished things they loved. The bodies were laid across pyres. Citizens were gathered on each side of the bodies. One by one, as senior members of the Dawnguard walked past the bodies with torches, they lit each of the pyres aflame. Sentries and Rangers were still on high alert. From their posts atop the walls of the keep they could see the Arathorian forces in the distance at the base of the Alterac Mountains. Following their retreat from two nights before, they set up encampments on the mainland. Their forces didn’t seem to be growing in number, but remaining steady. With watchful eyes, they kept their distance. <br/><br/>After the memorial service concluded, Sephariel, her sisters, other high ranking members of their House, and their military forces convened in the Main Hall to discuss the situation. All were present at the meeting, with one exception, Lord-Commander Materon Silversworn. In his place, Scout-Captain Lamaenel Lightblade sat. This wasn’t the first time she had to do this. She once filled in for him when he was granted time away on leave for a fortnight, so she was familiar with the role of Acting-Commander. <br/><br/>Sephariel sat in her usual place with Lamaenel to her right where Materon would normally sit, and her sister, Sepheriah Dawnbringer to her left. Sepheriah, one half of a set of twins with her sister Sephariah, was poorly received by many because of rumors from her past that she was responsible for the deaths of their parents. Nevertheless, she still was cherished by Sephariel, because she knew that everything her sister had been through made her strong. Her mastery over certain magics was well-known as well. She had been given the name, <em>Crimson Phoenix</em>, by the citizenry because many believed she was killed in the scourge war, only to resurface amidst rumors of treachery. It was intended as a pejorative, always spoken of in a mocking fashion, but over time Sepheriah claimed it as her own, and made it something to be proud of. She wore it as a badge of honor. She understood that you only give people the power that you wish for them to have. With a prudish posture, she sat, her icy green hues sharply observing the others gathered before them.<br/><br/>“You all know why we are here.” Sephariel began, “Something must be done about the Arathorian threat. We would be fools to think they mean to do anything but attack again.”<br/><br/>Lamaenel spoke up quickly, “My Lady, we have enough wood to construct four small seaworthy vessels, if we begin deconstructing less vital structures within the walls of the keep, we can produce twice as many.”<br/><br/>Sephariel looked on thinking for a few moments, before turning back to Lamaenel curiously, “How many will fit in one of these vessels?”, to which Lamaenel replied without missing a beat, “Six, my Lady, and that is pushing it. I can’t guarantee they’ll stay afloat beyond that.”<br/><br/>Hearing her words, Sephariel began to nod slowly, “Very well. Do what you need to do. Even with these vessels, that will do nothing for most of the people on the keep grounds.” She began muttering, “Most will be trapped here.” A look of sadness came over her in that moment as she realized that if the keep were to fall, most would die by the sword.<br/><br/>Sephariel’s sister Amarth’anel interjected, “Sister, it will not come to that. They will fall before us like the spineless weaklings they are. None shall stand against us and live. If it comes to that, I request permission to remain behind and destroy them in the name of our House.” Saliea Dawnbringer, sitting next to Amarth’anel chimed in, “As will I.”<br/><br/>Sephariel remained quiet as she sat there in her chair. She drew her hand up to her chin and thought to herself as she looked out across the people gathered before her, studying them. She then gave a reluctant nod of approval to her sister and her sister’s wife, “Very well. I will allow this under the circumstances. You’ve made me proud, Amarth’anel. You always did. Saliea, always know that I have loved you as a sister.” Sephariel gave Amarth’anel a broken smile quickly as she turned to the rest, “Anyone else willing to do what is necessary to ensure some live?”<br/><br/>Sepheriah began to speak, “Sister, I have-“ Sephariel cut her off, “No! I don’t want to hear any more about my family sacrificing themselves. One sister is enough. I know that you want to, and I know that you are able, but I forbid it. At least one of us must survive.” She looked at Sepheriah with a determined, almost desperate expression upon her face, “Do you understand?!”

Sephariel kept thinking to herself about her brother Alenil that was executed, thinking about the death of Amarth’anel, only to be risen by the scourge as a death knight, and that her other sister, the other twin Sephariah was missing, likely dead for all she knew. They both knew that the only person left in the line of succession was Sepheriah. Amarth’anel would be unable to claim the seat of House Dawnbringer due to her state of undeath. Her brother is dead, her other sister missing, and one is risen in undeath. She is all that would remain should something happen to Sephariel.<br/><em><br/>Sepheriah had to survive.</em><br/><br/>The various commanders of the Dawnguard and Suntread Rangers, along with other officers, stood up and reaffirmed their allegiance to Sephariel, and that they would lay down their lives if necessary to protect her and ensure that as many as they could, would be sent to safety. Several of the most seasoned officers had been with her since she left Quel’thalas, and even served under her father, Lord Sepharian Dawnbringer, the House patriarch, and many of the Dawnbringer’s namesake. <br/><br/>One of the officers, Commander Nor’drain Windborne stepped forward and kneeled, “With respect, my Lady.” Sephariel nodded approvingly, “Yes, Commander?”<br/><br/>“I served under your father’s command, and it would do me no greater honor to command the remaining forces should something go wrong. I would see you make it to safety as well, my Lady. Let me bear this burden. I’ve served for a long time, more than anyone else here. I will give them hell.” He looked back at those gathered as they all gave a slow nod of acceptance.<br/><em><br/>Sephariel noted their responses as he finished speaking. </em><br/><br/>“Commander Windborne, I-“, humbled by his selfless gesture, Sephariel began to fumble for words before the Commander cut in, “Please, Sephariel. You need not say anything. If it looks like the keep will be lost. Get to the boats. Save yourself, and the soul of our people.”<br/><br/>Sephariel said nothing aloud, but the look on her face said more than words could ever say. She closed her eyes and nodded humbly at the Commander’s request. The battle-hardened Commander dressed in his scarred and plated armor rose up from his knee slowly, turned around, and returned to his seat. With no way off the island for everyone, and the Arathorian forces surrounding them, everyone in the room fell silent, knowing that many in the room may not survive should the humans attack again.<br/><br/>After the silence wore off, Commander Windborne began to speak, “We’ll need our best sentries at the front. I want our best rangers posted at all of the fault lines of the keep’s weakened defenses.” He stopped for a moment and looked down a map laid out across the table, “What is left to do as far as reinforcing the walls that were damaged?”<br/><br/>Lead Architect Da’thris Fireblade stepped up to the table from behind one of the Commanders, “We’ve done everything we can. For the most part, the walls are as good as they were before the last attack. We can’t fortify them any better with what we have here. They should hold,” he paused, “for a time. Beyond that, I can give no guarantees, Commander.”<br/><br/>The rugged Commander gave Da’thris a nod of acknowledgement, “Very well.” He then turned to the now acting Scout-Commander Lamaenel Lightblade, “Lamaenel, once you have the vessels ready, come find me. I will need for you to take care of something before anything happens. It’s important.” She could see the seriousness in his eyes and in the tone of his voice, and with a prompt reply, “Yes, Commander.” The Commander then looked to Lady Sephariel, “With your permission, my Lady, I’d like to begin having our soldiers comb through the residents and arm everyone. We’ll need every able body we can get.” With a stern follow-up, “Everyone.”<br/><br/>The Lady knew what he was implying. Flashbacks from the scourge wars in Quel’thalas kept running through her mind,<em> Is this really happening, again? </em>Her eyes met his, “Proceed, Commander. You may continue the rest of your planning for our defenses.” The Commander gave a sharp nod, “As you wish, my Lady.”

She then stood from her seat, and shortly after, the rest of the room rose up to their feet as well. Once everyone was standing, she began to address them, <br/><br/>“Thank you, each of you for your service, for your selfless sacrifices you have already made, and have yet to make. I can never begin to fully express the aching in my heart in this moment. It is with great hesitation, but with the resolve of my father, and every Dawnbringer before him, that I send you to war against an enemy such as this. This time we are not just fighting for our home, or our land. We are fighting for our very lives, our continued existence! May the light guide each of you. Never forget who you are, or where you came from.<br/><br/>If they mean to destroy us, take as many of them with you as possible, so that our children can survive. Your deaths will not be in vain! You will be legends and remembered for all of eternity for what you do here today. May your blades swing swift, and your arrows strike true!<br/><br/>Selama ashal'anore.”<br/><br/>The ranking officers rendered their salutes as Sephariel returned them with a bow. Afterwards, Sephariel, Lamaenel, and Sepheriah exited the room, followed by the rest of those gathered.<br/><br/>It was nearing dusk, as the Sun made its last appearance on the horizon. There was lots of shuffling about, as residents moved hurriedly in various directions carrying supplies, weapons, and tools. It was colder than usual as night fell across the island. Eventually though, all of the moving around slowed, and quietened as some began to rest while others stood watch. They had been on guard day and night in shifts at that point for three days.<br/><br/>Sephariel sat in her bedroom reading through old diaries trying to better understand the frame of mind her father had during the most difficult of times, when suddenly,<br/><em><br/>Knock, knock, knock.</em><br/><br/>She quickly put the diary away, and heard her sister Sepheriah ask, “Are you busy?”<br/><br/>“No. Come in.” She replied. Her sister came in and sat next to her on her bed, “How are you feeling?” Sephariel knew that it was unlike her to come in and ask such things, so she went straight to the point, “What’s wrong, Sepheriah?”<br/><br/>Sepheriah looked surprised by the quick, pointed response, “I’m worried about you.” Sephariel sat there for a moment staring at her sister, “I’m worried about all of us.” She quipped reaching over to the diary, “I’ve been reading our father’s writings, trying to understand the way he thought. How he managed to last through so many battles against the trolls, the orcs, and what exactly he did in his final days as the scourge began to bear down on him.” Sepheriah looked at the journal in Sephariel’s hands, “What were you able to learn?” Sephariel shrugged, “Nothing really. Most of his writings were about us. He didn’t seem to write much about his military engagements.” Sepheriah shook her head, “Maybe he’d rather not remember them. I can’t blame him, after what I’ve seen.”<br/><br/>Sephariel nodded, “Nor do I.” Sephariel let out a big sigh and fell back onto her bed, flat on her back, “I keep saying I’m not ready for this, but when is anyone ever ready for something like this?”<br/><br/>At that moment Sephariel began to feel her eyelids get heavy. She heard her sister saying something, but her voice faded and within a minute or two, Sephariel was fast asleep. Her sister walked over and grabbed the journal, “Get some sleep. You probably haven’t slept in weeks.” She then left with it to read on her own as Sephariel lay there, sleeping peacefully.

<em>Light was all around her. She felt light on her feet, as if she could jump and never land. She felt like she was floating, perhaps? After a short time had passed, the light faded. She found herself on her feet, standing in the middle of field. As the light faded, she felt a darkness growing around her. She felt trapped. She couldn’t breathe. She didn’t know what was going on, and suddenly, it released. She sighed heavily and stood there, her eyes shifting in various directions. She saw something in the distance, but what was it? Was it a person? Was it glowing? It’s so far away. She began to move towards it. She felt like she wanted to move towards it. She needed to go to it, but why? <br/><br/>She kept going for what seemed like forever, but she knew that not much time had passed. The figure began to look more clear to her. The armor was unmistakable. Only her father wore armor like that. That looked like her father. What was he looking at? He was facing away from her, looking down over a cliff. She began to shout out, “Father! Is that, could that be, you? Father! Wait! Please!” She kept running towards the figure. She was so close. She could see him. He was standing and then he started to kneel down as if trying to see whatever he was looking at more clearly.<br/><br/>She had made it. She was there. Panting, she approached him and as she did he stood up. He turned around, but, it wasn’t her father. He had a human face and a dagger in his hand. He quickly lunged it at Sephariel, striking her through her heart. As she collapsed to the ground, she looked on in horror as she realized what he was looking at. As she lay there dying on the ground, she watched the unimaginable.<br/><br/>It was Dawnbringer Keep burning to nothing as the Arathorians over ran it. Everything faded to nothing.</em>

<strong><span class="underline">The Red Dawn</span><br/></strong><br/><br/>Part II<br/><br/>It was in that moment she awoke, sweat pouring from her head, breathing heavily. She went into a fit crying, “No! No! No!” She knew by now that her dreams having meaning. She knew what had to be done. <em>My father’s trying to warn me. I know it.</em><br/><br/> She stormed out of bed and got her things together. She ran to the Main Hall and sent a scout to find Lamaenel to inform her that her presence was required, immediately. Within minutes Lamaenel came running through to the Main Hall, “Yes, my Lady? You needed me?”<br/><br/> Sephariel spoke quickly and to the point, “Lamaenel, I have to know right now, if we consumed everything possible to make boats what can we do?”<br/><br/> Lamaenel had a look of confusion on her face, but straightened out as she began thinking, “I-I, I’m not sure. I’d hav-“ Sephariel cut her off abruptly, “We have to get everyone off the island. Now! I want you to go down there and get started immediately. Start loading people onto boats and send them away. We have to begin the evacuation now.”<br/><br/> Lamaenel began to look very concerned. Luckily no others were within earshot at that moment, “At once, my Lady.” Sephariel stopped her as she began to take off, “Begin getting others to tear down everything that can be used to build vessels. We’re getting off this island by dawn.”<br/><br/> Lamaenel paused at her words, “Yes, my Lady.” And then shot off at a full run.<br/><br/> It was nearing midnight across the land. The moon was bright and high in the sky that night. In its light you could make out shadows as they crawled across the courtyard. Sephariel had made her way back to her chamber. Not long had passed since Sephariel sent Lamaenel away, when suddenly her sister Sepheriah stormed in, “I just heard what you ordered. What the hell is going on?”

Sephariel looked at her, “I had a dream again Sepheriah. Only this time, I think it was father.” Sepheriah’s eyes grew wide and with a sobering voice from the bottom of her throat she said, “What?”<br/><br/> Sephariel nodded at her words, “There was light, everywhere and then darkness. I thought I seen him but as I got close to him it was a human. He stabbed me through my chest. My heart, I think. I felt a piercing pain, and then, emptiness. It was a hollow void, and then I felt as if I was being crushed. I remember hitting the ground and I could see the keep on fire in the distance. I think I was in the mountains somewhere. Everything was burning and the humans were everywhere. I don’t really remember what happened next. I think I died.”<br/><br/> Sepheriah looked on, distraught. She knew more than most about certain magics, dreams, and things like that most would consider taboo, even in places that celebrate magic such as Dalaran. Sepheriah’s realm of expertise was of the Fel. Demonic energies, and all the twisted, vile things that come from it.<br/><br/> <em>Chaos.<br/><br/> Destruction.<br/><br/> Suffering.<br/></em><br/> She was turned to darkness long ago, when she was forced to do the unimaginable. She was never able to forgive herself, or forget about what she’d done. Nor would others let her make peace with it. She knew what really happened. She knew in her heart it was the right thing to do, but the act of doing it changed her forever. She bore a burden heavier than most will ever know. It’s this that compelled her to the darkness. In it she was free. She was liberated.<br/><br/> Sepheriah sat down next to her, reaching out an open hand around Sephariel in an attempt to comfort her. After a minute or two passed, Sephariel looked at her, “What do you think? It felt surreal. It was the most lucid dream I’ve had in a long time.” Sepheriah was quiet in thought. She knew what it meant, but she wanted to be sure first.

Sepheriah broke a grin, “Do you remember that time when we were young that I tried to go catch a baby dragonhawk?” She started a laugh, and then Sephariel joined her hesitantly.<br/><br/> “Yes! You were horrible. How could I forget? Mother was furious. All of the sentries wanted to go after you when you <em>actually</em> came home with it, but they were afraid.” Sephariel burst out laughing, “I still remember their faces! Mouths wide open, I thought their jaws would never get off the ground!”<br/><br/> Sepheriah fired back, “Yeah! I remember feeling so accomplished. I knew I would get in trouble, but I did it anyway!”<br/><br/><em>The two laughed together, for the first time in a long time and for a time, they forgot about the worldly troubles that loomed around them.</em><br/><br/> After a few moments of laughter, Sephariel straightened her face into a more serious expression, “Weren’t you at all afraid?” Sepheriah shook her head, “No, not really.” She stopped, attempting to correct herself, “OK, well, maybe just a little. The thing was, it was something that I’d never done, but I believed I could do it.”<br/><br/> Sephariel leaned over on the bed, propping herself up with her elbow, “It’s going to sound weird, but I was always jealous of you.” Sepheriah turned around fast and looked at her in disbelief, “You’ve clearly lost your mind.”<br/><br/> Sephariel sat back up with a small grunt, “No, I’m being serious. You were always so wild and free. I, on the other, was being groomed. They wanted to hold me to a different standard than everyone else. I would get so angry at times. You and Sephariah got to do all of the fun stuff, while I was busy training in the Clerical Order. Always had to do this, do that, be at official events. They’d never let me do anything, and if I messed up, I’d regret it in ways that you and our other sisters and brother didn’t.”

Sepheriah sat there as if Sephariel’s words had just registered in her head. She put it together and realized that her sister was right. She also thought that their brother Alenil had also been through something similar to Sephariel, “You’re right about some of that, but Alenil was thrown into the Dawnguard as soon as he was old enough, remember?” Sephariel shot back quickly, “Yes, I do remember but when he was promoted up in the ranks of the Dawnguard, things became a lot easier for him back home. Father made all kinds of concessions for him. He was so proud of Alenil for following in his footsteps.”<br/><br/> Sephariel went quiet after that and her sister pulled their father’s diary out from a pocket on her robe, “How did you get that?” Sephariel asked. Sepheriah knew she would hear it for taking it, “When you fell asleep. I wanted to know as well.” Her eyes grew small, “He’s my father too, ya know!” Sephariel just sat there and shook her head, “You’re right. Next time just ask me.” Sephariel caught the book when she tossed it to her, a placing it on a stand next to her bed.<br/><br/><em>By now, it was late into the night and in a few short hours the sun would be coming up. Sephariel almost wanted to not think about it, because she was afraid of what that could mean. At the same time, she knew what she needed to do.</em><br/><br/> Sephariel rose to her feet, “We need to go find out how things are going.” And with that, her sister got up as well and they both headed out to the entrance to the keep.<br/><br/> The courtyard was surprisingly busy. People were tearing down buildings for scrap wood and nails. Others were taking the wood and finding ways to assemble it together to make boats and rafts. Some of the citizens were starting to line up, children first, and then their mothers. Each boat would hold one mother and five children. The males and childless females would go last.<br/><br/> Lamaenel approached Sephariel suddenly. She looked worn down, sweating and tired, “my Lady, all is going well. We should have enough ways off the island for most. Some of our architects raised the idea of using rafts. Doing that, we would be able to use less materials and get more across. It will be riskier, but it provides for less people to be trapped on the island.”<br/><br/> Sephariel almost smiled at the news, “Thank you, Lamaenel. Please pass on my thanks to the architects. They may have just saved countless lives.” Lamaenel nodded sharply and started to take off, “Oh, and one more thing,” Sephariel said, “go rest. Get a few hours of sleep. You need it.” Lamaenel looked tired, but determined, “my Lady, I’m fine. This needs to be done.”

Sephariel shook her head at her words, “Unacceptable. You’ll get a few hours’ rest and then you can resume your duties. You’ve done enough for now.” She gave a curt smile and Lamaenel turned in for some rest.<br/><em><br/> A loud BOOM was heard that echoed through the courtyard, rattling everything. Screams were heard and people started running.</em><br/><br/> Sephariel looked at her sister, “What was that?” Sepheriah was standing ten feet away at that point near the edge of the keep. She ran over and looked, “The residential area is on fire! They’re attacking again from the air!” Sephariel’s heart sunk, “No…” She spoke lowly. The light from the flames was causing other buildings to cast shadows everywhere. She could hear the wings of the gryphons cutting through the air. Every so often she would get a glimpse of the moon and fire glistening across their polished plate.<br/><br/> “Sepheriah!” She shouted, “Go now to the boats and make sure people are away from the island. We need everyone to go now!” Sepheriah gave a look of disapproval and walked off. She could hear Commander Windborne shouting from the top of the keep, as she looked up to him from the ground.<br/><br/> He stood there, in full battle armaments, his blade in-hand pointing in various directions calling out commands. Sephariel thought, <em>These are the sons of my father. These are our last line of defense. Light save them</em>. She was in the courtyard at the time and could see her rangers along the walls of the keep, their bows drawn and releasing. She knew that the keep was surrounded all along the southern side. Judging from the way they were firing, their approach to the island was massive. The Dawnguard was positioned in lines within the keep itself, with some spread along the walls filling in as rangers where possible.<br/><em><br/> A loud CRACK was heard throughout the entire keep, coming from the main gate.</em>

Scout-Commander Lamaenel Lightblade approached in full battle-rattle, “my Lady, we must get you out of here! They’re attempting to take the main gate! We’re stretched thin and they’re everywhere! If we don’t go now, you will die here!” Sephariel realized that Lord-Commander Silversworn was nowhere to be found. It was then that she realized he’d abandoned her, in her darkest hour. She felt, despair. She looked back and seen that Suntread Rangers and the Dawnguard were defending the sides of the keep, preventing the humans from encircling it from the northern side. This was allowing small groups of elves to leave the island. <em>Some are going to make it</em>, she thought.<br/><br/> She heard Lamaenel and looked over at her, “I’m staying.” Lamaenel couldn’t believe what she’d heard, “No you can’t. You have to go! Any second that gate is going to come down! All of these elves, they are prepared to die for you! You’re not going to let that happen for nothing!”<br/><br/> In that moment, she knew that she couldn’t stay. Lamaenel was right. Gryphons were diving in and out of the courtyard, evading arrows from the Rangers along the walls. Their attacks were getting bolder by the minute.<br/><br/> Commander Na’drain Windborne was still atop the keep with others surveying the engagement. Slowly but surely they were whittling away at the remainder of the Suntread Rangers along the walls. The Arathorians were spearheading a massive invasion. Far greater than would normally be required. After their initial failure, they weren’t going to accept defeat again.<br/><br/> The gryphons were decimating them in their fly overs, dropping explosives and brute force attacks causing parts of the keep wall to break apart. As he watched from the top of the keep, surrounded by a small contingent of rangers and sentries, he couldn’t help but notice the sky turning blood red as the sun came up, and fires raged across buildings within the keep itself.<br/><br/> The seasoned veteran of many wars looked at all of the forces he had with him, “I want all of you to go down below and join the fight. You’ve done well. Go do what you can to save as many as possible. It was an honor fighting beside you.” They all popped sharp salutes and went on their way. He then took up his blade and went down as well. As he came out of the keep, he couldn’t believe his eyes.

“Lady Dawnbringer, why are you still here?! Go! This is not your fight anymore. Go! Lightblade, get her out of here right now!” She’d never seen him that way in all the seasons that she knew him, but she knew that there was nothing she could do. She turned away, feeling defeated with tears in her eyes as Lamaenel grabbed her by her arm. On the way out of the keep, with Lamaenel at her side, she noticed all of the bodies of her kin just littered across the ground. <em>People that died so that she and the children may live.</em><br/><br/> “Where is Sepheriah?” She asked, sounding desperate, “She’s already on her way to Tirisfal.” Upon hearing that, a part of her calmed down, “Good”, She said under her breath. Lamaenel looked over at Sephariel once more, “All of the children and most of their mothers made it. You’re going to be one of the last ones to go.” Sephariel by that time had gone quiet, in utter disbelief and shock of what she’d seen. From a break in the wall behind the keep, she could see the silhouette against the fires of Commander Windborne and his remaining forces in the keep, just as the gates fell.<br/><br/> The human forces had broken through, and met against four rows of the remaining members of Sephariel’s Dawnguard commanded by Windborne. They were now under siege from the front and from the air. The forces of Arathor, commanded by Highlord Abahm Dereth, clashed against the remaining elves in hand-to-hand combat, but were ultimately overwhelmed.<br/><br/>Amidst the fighting and chaos within the walls of the keep, the veteran Commander was unleashing a fury of attacks, taking down as many humans as he could.<br/><br/> “Slay them all!” Windborne cried out. More than half of his elves had fallen, along with many of the humans. Windborne looked back and seen that all the boats were away, he felt a knot in his stomach, as he knew this would be it. <br/><br/> Highlord Dereth of the Arathorian forces approached the line mounted atop his pristine steed. Adorned in armor that seemed to glow as the sun broke across the horizon. He yelled out, “Surrender, and you may yet be able to keep what’s left of your lives!” This drew the ire of Commander Windborne, “We’ll never surrender to the likes of you.” The old Commander then yelled out to his dwindling number of Dawnguard, “Fight on in the name Sepharian! Lay these dogs low!” As he raised his blade into the air, an archer atop a gryphon landed a shot through his lower left side.

He felt the air leave his lungs and dropped to one knee. Blood ran down his legs. He could feel it run cold as it reached his knee. The fighting was still waging on. He reached behind him and felt the arrow. It slipped between his plates and managed to penetrate through. He broke it off at the base and rose up to his feet.<br/><br/> The Highlord dismounted and unsheathed his blade. It was so well polished, it looked white against the light of day as he wielded it. He began making his way for the Highlord, <em>I can end it here and now</em>, thought the Commander.<br/><br/><em> Their blades met.</em><br/><br/> Highlord Dereth and Commander Windborne met in single combat, “You can still surrender! You don’t have to die here! Order your elves to lower their weapons and surrender. It can all end here! Now!” The battle-hardened commander belted out, “We’ll never surrender. You’ll never take her. This keep belongs to the Dawnbringers, and to the Horde!”<br/><br/> The Highlord wailed away at the elf, over and over again. Each time he found the commander’s blade there waiting. In a sudden bout of speed, the commander spun around with a dagger he kept on his side, after parrying the Highlord’s attack he managed to land a small blow on him, grazing his left cheek, “This land belongs to Arathor. It all belongs to Arathor. We are here to retake what has been stolen from us.” The Highlord said furiously.<br/><br/> The commander moved in for the kill. He was tired and ready for it to be over. He raised his blade and swung at the Highlord with all of his might, meeting his blade. The Highlord hit his blade and spun it around faster than the worn down elf could move and caught him just below his chest plate. Wounded and bleeding now on both sides, he pressed on. The Highlord spat out blood that had run down onto his mouth from where he was bleeding across his cheek, “You’ve no fight left in you elf. Drop your blade. I’ve given you more chances than you deserve.”<br/><br/> The elf said nothing, and moved in for one more attack. The Highlord threw his blade up quickly, disarming the Commander and sending his blade flying across the courtyard.

Commander Windborne stood there, stunned, blood running everywhere. He had grown pale by then from the loss of blood. Panting heavily, he stumbled trying to stand. The Highlord could tell he was a capable foe and realized the situation.<br/><br/> “Any final words?”, the Highlord said, spitting blood as he said it. Windborne collapsed to one knee under his own weight and shook his head, “Nothing,” he began to cough, “to say, to you.”<br/><br/> The Highlord walked around behind him, and raised his blade in the air, “Look among you, elves of House Dawnbringer.” He paused, only for a moment, and lowered his blade, decapitating him.<br/><br/> In his last command, the Highlord said, “Finish them off.” Then walked to the main gate of the keep, and mounted his steed.<br/><br/> From their rafts, Sephariel could see the banks of Tirisfal.<br/><br/> Looking back towards the keep, all she could see was fire and smoke plumes going high into the sky. The children on the raft looked to her, “Are we going to be OK?”<br/><br/> She pulled them close to her, “I think so. I think so.” She thought to herself,<em> I will never let them hurt you.</em>
