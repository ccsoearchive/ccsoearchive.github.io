Nicias Entered the sludge fields. The first thing he noticed was the smell of sulfur that crept into his nose. Yet he continued on. He walked over to the warden of the operation. Warden Stillwater at first claimed that nothing was wrong but eventually after Nicias surveyed the prison, finding that most of the humans have turned into undead monsters, and have even slain some of the guards! Stillwater then begged for help and Nicias agreed to go slay some of the zombies. <br/> Nicias went into the yard and began to fight the undead, easily slaying all in his path. As he continued on he heard screams, human screams. Nicias was confused as he did not see a single human, but then he looked down at the ground and what he saw horrified him. Humans were "planted" in the ground, helpless, and having their heads eaten by the undead. Nicias appalled, decided he could not sit idly by and let even humans suffer such horrific deaths. He grabbed a shovel and began digging them up. 1 by 1 he eventually managed to free the fifteen that were left alive. Nicias also finished up clearing the yard of the undead and returned with a few questions. <br/> When Nicias confronted Warden Stillwater, he acted clueless and blamed the undead. Nicias pondered this and was a little more curious about the problem, but Stillwater had another task, this time Nicias would need to find a fellow blood elf who needed help. Nicias went searching for this elf and eventually found him in an abandoned house next to a cage. As Nicias entered the house he saw that the elf was crying. Nicias then turned his attention to the person in the cage. He introduced him self as Apothecary Lydon. Lydon tells Nicias of the what truly is going on and Nicias understands what he must do. Together with Lydon and Johny, They Slay the undead abominations created by Stillwater and eventually confront him. As they do, Stillwater has all his guards attack, yet they are slaughtered mercilessly. Nicias levels his sword to Stillwater's throat, but he just laughs. Nicias swings his sword attempting to decapitate the insane criminal, but he transforms into a gigantic undead brute. Nicias Tightens his grip and charges. The fight lasts a few minutes. The swing of Nicias' sword penetrating and cleaving off raw flesh, as well as the thundering attacks of the giant. Nicias found that the help of the apothecary was great, All his wounds were healed instantly and he was able to eventually deal the finishing blow. Nicias then walked over to the corpse, removed the head and handed it to Lydon. "Present this to the Banshee Queen and let her know of what this monster has done." Lydon just smiled and replied " I will." and with that took the head and headed for the Under city.

The thunder of the giant Yeti shook the ground as Kara fought bravely to help some fawns escape the predatory lions. Kara turned at just the right moment to be sent flying through the air, the yeti had just punched her and the blow was so great she flew almost fifty yards away. Picking herself off the ground she prpared to slay the yeti, but did not see the lion come up behind her.<br/><br/>Wounded and stunned she could only feebly try and cast a heal on herself, but the yeti and the lion managed to bring her health to a dangerously low level. Before she could even recover a stag joined in the fight, and then another lion gripped her leg and tore a huge hole in her. Gasping in her struggle, Kara thought of the Fellowship...what would happen to them if she died? Would anyone take up the mantle of leadership and keep the Fellowship going?<br/><br/>The battle was too much for her and she regretted not taking a companion to the field. With her last breath she prayed to the Light for her death to not be in vain. The lions did not seem to care for Sindorei flesh, nor did the yeti. The deer sniffed at her corpse and bounded off. Eventually a guard from Tarren Mill found her body and carted it off to the Undercity. No doubt it would be reanimated. The identification papers on her gave them a name of a cousin in Silvermoon who would accept the notification of her demise.

The day had been a trying one for Karamia. Learning of her cousin's demise she went to SIlvermoon to deliver the last wishes of Kara Vaelia to the Fellowship. Her contemplations were interrupted by a handsome warrior who wore the tabard of the Rising Sun Fellowship. Knowing only that this was one of the groups followers, she approached him with heavy heart. <br/><br/>"Are you one of those from the Rising Sun Fellowship?" her voice was quiet and she had to wipe tears from her eyes. The elf paused and nodded to her, his manner seemed gruff and business like.<br/><br/>"I am Tyrael Firehawk, what is it you need?" he replied. As he stood there gazing at her Karamia could not help but remember her cousins words. {He is strong and driven to glory, a worthy warrior and a great asset to the Fellowship.} Karamia felt tears in her eyes and she had to calm herself.<br/><br/>"I bring you bad news, Kara Vaelia has fallen, she was battling a yeti in Hillsbrad. She had asked me in a letter to turn over the reins of the Fellowship to someone she trusted. She mentioned you, she had a great deal of respect for you as a warrior. Would you take her tabard and continue the cause she started?"<br/><br/>He seemed shocked and saddened by the news. Agreeing to take the Fellowship in hand he also asked her to keep the tabard and join them. "You want me to join you? I will need a lot of training...it has been a long time since I weilded a sword. I will think on it and let you know."<br/><br/>He then said he had to inform the Fellowship of Kara Vaelia's loss, and left to do so. She wondered how they would take the news and if any of them evenrealized how much they all meant to her..

How many more will fall? How many more must be lost before we accomplish something? We are so few... Too few I fear. We fall, and yet we still push onwards! How futile. The determination of the mortal races is not to be questioned, and while we, the Sin'dorei, may number less than some, we too, are strong.<br/><br/>(The next paragraph is written with a heavier hand, as if the writer was angered or grieved.)<br/><br/>Kara Vaelia has fallen. Kara... She held the Fellowship together, and now, so soon, too soon, she is gone. A leaf on the wind, she came, and was taken. Life is so fragile. Life is so delicate. The woman is gone before her time, and she should still be here!! Why must life be taken? Why must we fight for such hopeless, unattainable things? I wish I could say that I knew, but I can only guess. I fight because there is yet some small, uncrushable hope. I know not why Kara fought, but I hope only that she died with honor.<br/><br/>(A detailed sketch of Kara Vaelia fills the rest of the page, depicting the Blood Elf paladin, weapon in hand, standing tall and proud.)<br/><br/>We honor the acts, bravery, and the dedication Kara showed, let it be known that even in the darkest hours, there is yet some hope. Hope for the future.<br/><br/>For Kara, Light bless her.

<em>Tarren Mill</em><br/>The room was filled with an overwhelming smell of flesh and blood as the young huntress returned from the hills. She dropped the bundles of hides she was carrying to the floor before washing the blood off her skinning knife. <br/><br/>Taking a moment to look over the spoils she had gathered from the countless yetis, lions and stags she had encountered. She sat down pulled out some parchment from her backpack and started designing armor to be made from the leather. She set to work making gloves, belts and boots.<br/><br/>After finishing her work she sighed. She had forgotten that it was only her alone in this world since she had left home; there was no need to have made so many items. She packed the excessive amount of gear into her bags and caught a flight to Undercity in search of a bank.<br/><br/><em>Undercity</em><br/>In yet another unfamiliar place alone, well not quite alone she did have her cat. As she made her deposit into the bank she wished she had someone to share her skills with rather than having them gather dust in storage. Afterwards she walked the hollow halls of Undercity staring into the unknown faces of the undead merchants and guards that now surrounded her. <br/><br/>She longed for her home and the company of fellow Sin’dorei at which point the symbol of a sun caught her eye. Turning to the message board next to her, she read about a fellowship looking for more members. Without hesitation she quickly jotted down a request to join and signed it with her trademark squiggle.

After hearing of Kara's fall to the great yeti of hills brad, Nicias was shocked. She had been stronger than him yet she had fallen. He glanced down at his two axes and tightened his grip, "Will this be enough to protect me?" he asked. Anger and rage filled his heart then, the loss of such a great leader was painful and angering. With his axes he began to hew enemies left and right. As some of the humans ran for their lives, it did not matter as Nicias only chased after them and executed them with decapitation. His axes dripped red with blood by the time his rage was quelled.

I took a break from killing things left and right for a fashion show. I never thought that I would be the kinda of person for that, but I have to admit, it was fun. And I won the cutest little pet. Well, I suppose 'cute' is a relative term. An enchanted pumpkin. It, I think it is a he, looks kind of sinister, but what can I say?<br/><br/>(the rest of the page is filled with a sketch of Dalaran, filled with people. In the bottom corner is a sketch of a sinister squashling.)<br/><br/>Kara's funeral will be later.<br/><br/>LATER:<br/><br/>I have been thinking. We are so few... so very few... What better way to fail, then to lack the strength?

<strong>Tyrael</strong><br/><br/>Kara has fallen and in her death I have been honor bound to take over the Fellowship. A daunting task for one who simply wanted to wage war across the globe and to earn glory and fame. But I am not alone in this endeavor anymore, it seems Kara made many friends along her journey and I have aided by others of the fellowship in leading it to where I believe Kara would want it to go.<br/><br/>If we are to succeed we must be stronger and we must be more disciplined. As such I have taken the title of Battlemaster within the Fellowship and passed along several other master positions to others of the Fellowship. I just hope I pick the right people, I cannot afford to let someone weak lead the fellowship. We as a whole cannot afford weakness, that is what brought Kara to her untimely end, weakness. I will see it burned from all those within the Fellowship. We will rise higher and the higher we rise the stronger we will become.<br/><br/>Through strength we shall succeed.<br/><br/>Glory in death.

Following in the footsteps of her cousin, Karamia fought and trained, driving herself to excell. Tyrael said that Kara had been weak, that she was too sentimental and soft. Walking through the Ghostlands the fledgling paladin decided to adopt the familiar nickname she had when she and Kara had attended family gatherings long ago. <br/><br/>She picked up the strange device given to her by Tyrael and tapped it gently to attract attention. "Hello...this is Karamia...I have had people call me Kara and sometimes get it mixed up with my cousin...so I am asking all of you to refer to me as 'Mia"...it may be less confusing that way." she waited to hear acknowledgement and satisfied herself the device was working. <br/><br/>Perhaps she should just tell people in person...if they could ever get together and speak to each other. Mia felt alone in the Ghostlands, having met few in the area she thought about going to the other side of the world and investigating the Barrens. But perhaps someone from the Fellowship would join her soon and she would have a partner.<br/><br/>She struck the ghoul down as it crawled out of the ground in front of her. Somehow she would have to prove her strength to Tyrael, she was not a weakling...she would be strong!

<em>The fellowship</em><br/><br/>Stopping at a post box to mail a letter home the young huntress noticed that her request to join the Rising Sun Fellowship had been approved with which she had received an invitation to join the fellowship in a memorial service for their recently fallen leader Kara'Vaelia. Although she had never met the founding leader of the fellowship she felt that she should at least pay her respects and take this as an opportunity to introduce herself to the remaining members.<br/><br/>Following the directions given she approached the site at which the service was to be held. To her relief she was not alone, and she greeted the couple that were already there. Shortly after more Sin’dorei arrived. Not wishing to get in anyone's way the young huntress took a step back from the group as they began to discuss Kara'Vaelia and their memories.<br/><br/>Removing herself a little further from the group as the tension rose. There seemed to be different views on which direction the fellowship was to take under its new leadership of Tyrael. The overall goal was the same but the means of how this was to be achieved seemed to be up for debate. Not wishing to be caught up in the politics of it all she remained quite silent watching and listening to the events unfold before her.<br/><br/>Tyrael gave a speech and wishes for each of the members before him. Having never met or heard of the huntress himself he had only wished her great honour and glory in the future. <br/><br/>The meeting was coming to an end and everyone returned their thoughts to Kara'Vaelia. Before leaving the huntress lit a fire in Kara'Vaelia's honor and spoke into the flames " Anu belore dela'na" (the sun guides us.) As everyone parted in their own direction the huntress followed Kellatira and Niciäs back to Tarren Mill.<br/><br/><em>Kara'Vaelia's revenge</em><br/><br/>The huntress along with Kellatira and Niciäs tracked and hunted down the Yeti which had brought Kara'Vaelia to an end. A life for a life. Once the task was complete she returned to the inn pulled out some parchment and wrote...

Honour and glory. <br/>But what is honour and glory, really? <br/>I have heard it spoken in regards to battle many times before and I will hear it for many years to come. "For honour!" "For glory!" Many speak of it as something worth fighting for. But is it?<br/>What truly makes an act of killing another honourable or glorious? <br/><br/>Tyrael wishes this to be something that I seek for myself but until I can come to grasps with what honour and glory really are or mean to me, I don't know if this is something that I want for myself.<br/>I mean after I achieve this glory through bloodshed by my hands, will someone wish for my head in honour and glory for their people?<br/><br/>I still have much to learn in this world but for now all I know is I will return home with or without glory.<br/><br/> -Quill <br/>(not written as Quill but drawn as a feathered quill much like a squiggled signature.)

Nicias Stared at the badge Tyreal had given him. Nicias laughed to himself. "How appropriate that I be called the avenger of the guild, while I am already an avenger." Nicias re-attached the pin to his tabard and got back to his feet. Kel had arrived on her war horse and Quil had just arrived as well. They all dismounted and stared out at their opponent. The great king of the Yetis was straight ahead, a towering creature of fur. They all readied their weapons for the confrontation that was about to take place. "This one is for Kara." Nicias said. They all nodded their heads and repeated, "For Kara." They all shouted and charged.<br/> The Yeti's first massive blow was met by Kel's shield. The massive fist smashed against the metal shield, yet Kel didn't budge. Nicias and Quil unleashed all their furry as the Yeti's attacks were not directed at them. The Yeti roared as he was hit again and again by the attacks, and yet loose another attack on Kel. Although this blow hit the shield, it pushed the shield back and made contact with Kel's body, knocking her back. Nicias unleashed his full rage, and Quil herself began firing even faster. The effects of their attacks began to show as the Yeti King began to bleed more and more. The Yeti roared and let loose another massive blow. This time Kel was knocked to the ground. She braced herself with one knee and was able to completely deflect the second blow, but she did not know how long she could hold for. Quil Let loose two more arrows, both making direct contact with the Yeti King's right eye. The Yeti roared in pain and Smashed his fist into the ground next to Kel, making a small crater. Kel had managed to get to her feet, but then received a head but from the yeti. Its massive horns making contact with her shield as well as her mail armor. She was knocked back again but managed to still hold her shield, not wanting to let down her friends down. Nicias saw the desperation in Kel's actions and decided that it was his turn to be a little reckless. He jumped onto the yetis back and with his twin axes began hewing away at the Yeti's exposed back. His axes dug deep into flesh and bone, greatly weakening the monster. The monster managed to throw Nicias from his back and Nicias landed hard on his back. The monster gasped for breath and slowly moved towards Kel yet again. "Dam that thing is persistent!" Nicias Grunted as he stood to his feet and raised both axes as he began to charge the beast. Quil let loose another volley of arrows, this time two dug deep into the neck of the Yeti, causing blood to spew forth in a fountain of red. The monster stopped and gagged. It struggled to breath as it teetered back and forth. Nicias lept into the air and raised both axes. He brought them both screaming down into the already damaged neck of the Yeti King. The steal axes managed to completely sever the flesh, decapitating the monster. As Nicias stood there, blood sprayed onto his back from the headless corpes. The red mist covered his whole body, he truly was the Berserker of the Fellowship. <br/> Nicias and Quil walked over to Kel. They both helped her up and she immediatly grabbed to her side. Nicias looked and saw a large gash through the now destroyed chainmail. It went from her lower waist all the way to her lower back. It had completely destroyed her kidneys as well as sever alot of the muscles. She was losing blood fast. She cast a healing spell and healed it as well as she could, but since she couldn't see all of it and was not a specialized healer, she was only able to slow the bleeding and heal some of the damage. Nicias pulled out a few woolen bandages and patched up the gash to help slow the bleeding. Both Quil and Nicias helped Kel to her horse and together they rode into Tarren Mill.

Part 2<br/> At tarren mill Nicias and Kel dismounted and Quil continued onto the next town to look for a healer there. As kel got off her mount she fell to the ground, unable to hold herself up. Nicias jumped off his horse and quikly went to her side. "You really did it this time didn't you." He said with a faint smile. Kel laughed a little, "I guess I did." Nicias gently lifted her up and walked her over to one of the nearby buildings. He gently set her down leaning agianst the wall. " I will go look for a healer, dont move!." Nicias said, the urgency could be heard by the little bit of panic in his voice. Kel nodded and leaned against the pillar. Nicias ran from building to building but was unable to find a healer. He stoped at the herbalist and had managed to persuade her to let him buy one of her greater healing potions. He handed over the gold coin and quickly took the potion to Kel. When he got to her He quickly removed the stopper and handed it to her. "Drink this, it should help you walk and should also help stop the bleeding. Kel reached out her shaking hand and took the magic potion. As she drank it she felt its power. It began to re-knit muscle and skin. It also helped slow the bleeding from her side. With the help of Nicias Kel was able to stand up. "Thank you." She said with a weak smile. "We arn't through yet, you still need that healer." Nicias replied back. "Quickly we shall go to the bat handler and catch a ride to the Undercity, they have to have a healer in that wretched place somewhere!" Kel nodded and while leaning on Nicias for support they walked over to the Bat handler. "Sorry, but the bats are eating, you''ll have too..." The bat handler began to say in a raspy voice. "Dam you! My friend is bleeding out! Your gonna give us a bat NOW!" Nicias yelled, veins in his neck began to show as his anger swelled. He would not let anymore die. "How dare you talk to me..." She began back in that same raspy voice as before. "I don't care if you are the dammed Lich King! Give us two bats to Undercity NOW!" Nicias was shouting by now and the bat handler had taken a few steps back, beginning to be afraid of this warrior. "If you must, here are two bats, they shall take you there immediately." The handler whistled and two large bats landed in front of the duo. Kel smiled at Nicias, " I cant thank you enough.." she said to him. "Don't thank me yet, you are still not healed." <br/> Nicias helped her onto her bat and the got onto his own and they were soon on their way to Undercity. When they landed Nicias immediately rushed to one of the guards and asked for directions to the nearest healer. Father Lankester was the nearest priest and with a large thank you Nicias returned to help Kel off her mount. Nicias grabbed her arm and with his helped they finally reached Father Lankester. "How can I help you......" he began when he first saw them, but his attention was soon turned towards the blood puddle at Kels feet. "Come here immediately and let me heal your wound! By the Light you are a lucky one!" He said as he began to chant his healing spell.<br/> As Kel set up she felt perfectly fine. She stared up at Father Lankester and thanked him. She then turned to her companion. "Thank you Nicias, I don't know if I would have made it without you." She said with a smile. "well just be more careful next time." he said with a playful grin. "I will." she promised. "Never again will i let a friend die." Nicias said, "I will make sure no more fall." And with that they said their farewells, and headed on their separate ways, hoping to see each other again soon.

<em>Kel'Tira Sunblaze</em><br/><br/><em>A cliff overlooking Azurebreeze Coast<br/></em><br/>We met on a cliff overlooking Farstrider Retreat and the coast to memorialize Kara's death. I wish that the service had not started off with angry words. I wish that we could all understand one another, but in that hope, I see the futility of endless agreement. We must have conflict to remain strong.<br/><br/>At the same time, I am both hopeful and scared for the Fellowship in Tyrael's hands. While I think he is more than capable, it seems sometimes he only sees the side of the future in relation to war. Blood is not the answer to everything.<br/><br/>(A sketch of the Fellowship looking out from the cliff follows these words.)<br/><br/>Ikthael made an appearance at the funeral, bringing levity to the situation, as well as another train of thought. The newest huntress, Quill, also came. As did Karamia, Kara's cousin. The latter seemed the most distressed, though I think I saw the first trace of emotion I have ever seen in Tyrael. Nicias seems to stand as a pillar.<br/><br/>With much of his usual tact, Tyrael managed to sooth ruffled feathers and admit his own shortcomings while at the same time highlighting the whole group's strengths. I feel there is more direction coming to our group, and that while Kara's death was before her time, she has united us in a common cause. A martyr. <br/><br/>Perhaps remembering is more than simply "not forgetting." When one dies, we mourn, we vow to remember, and then we pick up the pieces and try to put them back together. We cry, we grieve, but life goes on. Perhaps remembering is less not forgetting, and more acknowledging the past, honoring the dead. Alone, we are weak. Together we stand stronger. Unity, honor, loyalty, and fellowship shape us. just as Kara helped shape our group. She was a leader, and made the Rising Sun Fellowship all of that and more. More importantly, she was OUR leader. She has molded and shaped us, and will not soon be forgotten. In her death, she showed her loyalty and dedication to our cause. To some degree, she is a martyr. A figurehead, a standard to fight for. <br/><br/>In death, Kara has become a symbol of the hope for the future, and the light in the darkness that is the world.<br/><br/>Yes! We grieve, it would do her memory a great dishonor not to! But we do not drown in our sorrows, for Kara would not want us to waste what she has set into motion. The Rising Sun Fellowship honors her actions and words, and we will carry her memory with us always.<br/>We honor Kara's courage, her dedication, she fought for us, and just as she fought, so will we. No one can question her bravery or strength. We remember her healing nature, and warm smile. We recall her role as a guide, and a leader. As a friend, and a compatriot.<br/><br/>We honor Kara Vaelia, may the Light shine on her.<br/><br/> <em>Later: Undercity</em><br/><br/>Nicias, Quill, and I left for Hillsbrad after the funeral, our hearts and minds set on avenging our late leader. Yetimus would fall.<br/><br/>When we arrived, we stood for a moment, speaking quietly on the plains, waiting for the Yeti Lord to make an appearance. He did.<br/><br/>With cries, we dedicated our fight to Kara, our ferocity and steadfastness would have made her proud. I led, shield held high, and took the beast's attention, standing strong even as gargantuan fists rained punishment on me. With a roar, the beast flung me high into the air, and, with a quick prayer to the light, I was protected from harm as I landed. Struggling to my feet, I only barely got my shield up in time to catch another flurry of blows. I staggered, but still kept my shield up. <br/><br/>Nicias and Quill were blurs to me, the blood pounding in my ears. I could see the Yeti weakening, but I feared it would not be fast enough. My arms ached, my whole body ached. As Nicias leaped upon the Yeti Lord, the great beast lowered his head and roared, twisted horns rushing towards me. Too late, I realized I had no hope of avoiding the blow. I twisted, and that saved my life.<br/><br/>Instead of impaling my chest, the horn crushed my side. I collapsed, the pain was unimaginable. Fire seared through my body, and dimly I heard and felt the thud of the Yeti's corpse on the ground. <br/><br/>Quill and Nic helped me stand, and I reached for my side, wincing as the pain overcame my senses. It had dulled to an ache, and that worried me vaguely. When I brought my hand away from my side, it was covered in blood. Without being able to truly see the wound, and with little training in healing as it were, I could do little for myself, and every moment I could feel my strength ebbing away.<br/><br/>((1/2))

Nic wrapped bandages around it carefully, but all too quickly they were drenched in crimson. I closed my eyes, only to force myself to open them. Nic would accompany me to Tarren Mill, an offer I was grateful for, for I feared I could make it on my own. I feared for my life.<br/><br/>Every step of my charger was agony, the pain blinding. When the interminably long trip was done, I slid off my charger, collapsing on the ground. Nic helped me up, eyes worried. I could not help being honored and touched by his care through the fog of pain. Even the small distance we walked, well, he walked and carried most of my weight, was too much. I collapsed, sinking to the ground and propping myself against a pillar.<br/><br/>Eyes closed, I managed to nod as he walked away to find a healer, whispering after him weakly, "Hurry."<br/><br/>He did, and while the Forsaken lacked a healer, he was able to find a potion, and the healing liquid dulled the pain long enough for he and Quill to load me onto a bat for Undercity, Nic flying behind me.<br/><br/>When we arrived, I gritted my teeth and forced myself to walk, slowly, limping, through the city to the priests. I almost gave up. I admit that. I almost laid down to die. I kept on. Slowly, painfully, hopelessly, I kept on. If not for myself, than for my Fellowship.<br/><br/>By the time we reached the priest, my remaining armor was stained red, and the amount of blood pouring out of my side was alarming. Only through sheer will had I not collapsed and died already. Sheer will, and the help of Nic. Father Lankester was kind, insomuch as I have ever found Forsaken kinda. He healed me, closing the wound, repairing the damage, telling me I would be weak for a day or so, because of blood loss.<br/><br/>I rose to me feet, skeptically testing my weight, and almost passed out from dizziness. I caught Nic's hand, masking my need for balance behind gratitude and care for the man, "I don't know if I would have made it without you," I said, smiling slightly.<br/><br/>"Well, just be careful next time," he grinned at me.<br/><br/>"I will," I swore.<br/><br/>"Never again will I let a friend die," Nic said, "I will make sure no more fall."<br/><br/>I was touched by both his determination and his care for me, I was sad to see him go.<br/><br/>((2/2)

The day had been breezy and warm, of course in Eversong it was always pleasant. Karamia walked to the hill overlooking the sea. All the members of the Fellowship were there and she met some she had not before.<br/><br/>The all seemed to be disagreeing on how the Fellowship would progress. Mia was confused, how was this honoring a fallen comrade? They argued and yelled at each other. The sudden realization hit her then as she watched the emotions flaring. <br/><br/>Each of them had been touched by her cousin's life. They had seen Kara'a dedication to the Sindorei and the need for the Fellowship. She had given each one a piece of her spirit, perhaps even touching the ones who did not know her personally. The Fellowship would go on, as strong and dedicated people would ensure it did. <br/><br/>Mia stepped up and tried to intervene, to calm them with words of wisdom. Emotions were raw and they were all hurting. She was touched to see even Tyrael seemed to realize Kara's intentions were noble. His taking over of the Fellowship was going to be a hard road, he was more of a military leader. As he gave some of them badges, he set the pattern for the days to come. <br/><br/>No one was more surprised than Mia when he handed her a badge as well. It was a heavy responsibility. Keeping track of Lore and making sure all of them were honored with their accomplishments. Mia accepted this and felt honored as she put the badge on her tabard. <br/><br/>The rogue was a surprise, he was charming and likeable, and also a flirt! It was all Mia could do to not lead him on. His wit and charm had her running in circles and finally convinced her to travel to Orgrimmar. They went to Azshara and helped some goblins. He was amazingly competent and she kept him alive with her healing. They soon had things settled with the goblins. He had to leave and Mia wandered the streets of Orgrimmar, then went to mine the copious amounts of copper everywhere in the valleys of Durotar.<br/><br/>Later when she heard of the slaying of Yetimus, she resolved to create some kind of honor for them. Three heroes who destroyed the beast that had slain her cousin. She decided to have a feast in their honor. Now she had plans to make.

<strong>Tyrael</strong><br/><br/><em>The Funeral</em><br/><br/>The funeral did not go as I intended; debating and bickering ensued and it was slightly annoying to deal with but not unexpected. They are idealist, believing that words of peace and love can change the world. While I disagree there must be a place and time for all of it. It is why I knew that I would need officers, or as they are called Masters, to aid me in bringing the Fellowship higher and higher. It is why I gave Kel'tira the position of Spiritmaster, she was the loudest voice of opposition against my goals.<br/><br/>But that is why it is important to have her as my advisor, she is a strong fighter when it is necessary but she brings a different mentality to the Fellowship that is just as necessary as is my war driven senses. Her idealism will help keep all our eyes on the true goals of the Fellowship, to save this world from the evils that are out there. As I stated to them, I would turn this Fellowship into a war machine that could be unbeaten. I smile now as I sit here and write this out, remembering my exact quote to them. "We must be strong individually, so that together we are invincible."<br/><br/>It was at this point that I moved on to the warrior, Nicias, a beserker by all accounts as I gathered from his training and his choice in weapons. I would rather have given him the position of Battlemaster, but that could not happen with his style of combat. Instead I gave him the title of Avenger, in this position his style of combat and his berserker rage will be beneficial to him. Nicias will be the person who brings upon our enemies the Fellowship's wrath. I asked him to be always in the heart of combat, sowing death and destruction and putting our name out there among our enemies and allies. He will not disappoint.<br/><br/>Then came Karamia... So much like her cousin that it was slightly painful to speak to her but I put my weakness behind me. Kara Vaelia did not ask me to join the Fellowship because of my weakness! I must be the strongest, so that I can keep us together through anything. I must be like the rocks against the tide, unmoving and unshakeable. But to Mia I gave the task of recording our journeys and our battles. As Loremaster Mia will be responsible for reminding us of where we come from and pointing us in the direction that we must go. She is fit for the task in that it was her cousin who founded this Fellowship and she is so much like her that I feel she is right for the task.<br/><br/>Next the rogue, Ikthael the jokester as I like to call him, for him I asked that he be our eyes and ears in the shadows. Always watching our backs and listening to the whispers of the underground. Ikthael the Shadowmaster is what I know must call him I suppose. He was surprised and continued to make jokes about it when i gave him the badge of his office. I feel he will do well in this position.<br/><br/>That concluded my business at the funeral and as we dispersed I found myself headed back to Ashenvale, the war on Kalimdor continues...<br/><br/><em>Astranaar</em><br/><br/>Explosions rang off in the distant as Hellscream's Horde continued to pummel the Kaldorei, it was glorious. I pressed the attack on the ground, joined by more Grunts as he pushed through their now destroyed defenses. They didn't know what hit them! Our Goblin engineers were masterminds when it came to explosions and now we were inside the town of Astranaar, laying waste to everything in sight.<br/><br/>Glory in death as they say.

The Stonetalon Mountains were filled with ore and Mia was delighted to find so much silver and tin. The work was disturbing to say the least. So much destruction...she wondered at the zeal of the orc in command. <br/><br/>But her mind was on other things most of the time. She had to speak to Tyrael...something was not right with the mystery she had uncovered. A young Sindorei girl was in grave danger, and Ikthael had been contracted to do something that Mia begged him to hold off on...she needed more information.<br/><br/>It was not something she could use the communication device to openly discuss. She needed to get Tyrael alone and speak to him. Mia was troubled by this turn of events. She had to go carefully or it would destroy the Fellowship. Something she was set and determined not to do. But how she could do this was something she had no experience in. She was not a noble and had no idea the politics and intrigue involved. <br/><br/>It was giving her a headache to say the least. She worked hard and mined the silver. Someone in the guild was going to be pleasantly surprised at the bank deposit she would be making soon. Her thoughts turned to Tyrael, he was still bent on glory...but was his honor intact? She prayed to the Light he would listen to her with an open mind...or dire things would happen...traitors were never easy to deal with.

Rest. Never have I had so many issues with that word! Too bad no one can do anything for the blood loss... I spent thee day wandering the streets of Silvermoon, restlessly pacing through the lingering pain. I did, however, run into Tyrael.<br/><br/>"It heals well yes?" he asked of my wound.<br/><br/>"Aye," I replied slowly, "it still pains me, and according to the healers likely will for the rest of my days."<br/><br/>He nodded, seeming to understand, "I would have you seek out Varus Dawnstalker," he said, as I rubbed the bandages gently before her continued, "Last I heard he was here in the city. A Blood Knight like yourself but far stronger and more skilled."<br/><br/>"Have you any idea where?"<br/><br/>"I do not but rest assured I shall tell him to find you," he said, "He may not be a skilled healer but since his training is far more advanced than most I would say he could be of more assistance."<br/><br/>"I thank you, let it not be said that you cannot take care of your own."<br/><br/>He laughed, and I smiled at him. I cannot help but think that maybe I have judged him too quickly.<br/><br/>He looked saddened, "This is how I honor Kara Vaelia's memory..." he trailed off.<br/><br/>With a sigh, I responded that, "We all must honor her as we see it best."<br/><br/>"And as I said yesterday, we much be individually strong that we may stand invincible together. Your ideals will only get us so far just as much as my training regimens will. Together however they will form an unbreakable weapon"<br/><br/>"Aye, and I feel I owe you an apology, for I spoke without thought," I said, not finishing my thoughts aloud.<br/><br/>He shook his head, denying that fact, "You spoke from the heart and that is a quality I would not see squashed. We all must be individuals and yet one group. At times we will agree, others we will disagree."<br/><br/>"Yes... We must be able to see past others' short comings, and understand why we have come together."<br/><br/>He nodded at me, saying that he must leave, for he was keeping a friend waiting, and telling me to seek out Varus.<br/><br/>I cautioned him, "It will not be simple, to keep us together."<br/><br/>"That fact I know all too well..." With a salute, he added, "Until we meet again Kel'tira"<br/><br/>"Light be with you!" I called after him, shrugging as he laughed and murmured under my breath, "You laugh, Tyrael, but some day it will be the very same Light that will save you..." Turning away, knowing he did not hear, I went back to my wanderings.
