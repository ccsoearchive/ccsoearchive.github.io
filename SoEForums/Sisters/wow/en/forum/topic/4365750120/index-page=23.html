<em>A new small leather bound journal. A small worn sheet of paper is folded and tucked within it's pages... </em><br/><br/><em>The script is not the same as the first journal, it is shaky and weak, very labored</em><br/><br/>Death and pain have an amazing way of putting life in proper perspective. Death, the final frontier, hurts like all get out, or should I say getting there hurts like all get out. I vaguely remember any of it, which is probably a good thing. I remember flying across the ground for a brief moment, and then darkness. And nothing. No pain, no thought, nothing. Kind of restful...maybe not.<br/><br/>There was a light. It grew brighter to the point I had to close my eyes from the brightness. And then I felt more than heard a voice, and something else, love?<br/><br/>...and I was suddenly racked with a pain that felt red hot. I could barely breathe, I could barely catch a breath. And a wetness...what? I tried to open my eyes, but one would not open...the other caught a glimpse of an...an angel...she was all aglow with light...she looked familiar.<br/><br/>I tried to take inventory...but the pain was so great. I tried to move but nothing would obey my wishes, and I only called forth more pain trying...then I heard her...her sweet voice, the sweet voice of my Karamia! I could barely hear her, but I screamed out to her...and it came out a weak mewl, "Mia?"<br/><br/>I heard her sobs clearly...selective hearing, or was everything getting more in focus? I could taste blood in my mouth, I could smell her - her sweat, and her breath, and I felt a strong arm beneath my shoulders holding me up. I felt all my senses were made extremely heightened. And I saw her kneeling there, holding me close, her tears fell upon my face, and I tried to tell her I was sorry.<br/><br/>Sorry for the pain I had inflicted on her, the Fellowship, and myself. I was so sorry. Sorry for it all, sorry for so much. The effort was too much for my weary body, and I slipped into blessed unconsciousness. The pain went away, and there was only darkness.<br/><br/>I regained some resemblance of consciousness, and didn't recognize where I was. I felt naked..hey, where was my armor, who took my weapons, where was my gear...<em>Ooooo, why is my head swimming, stop the place from spinning, I need to get off...Ooooo.</em><br/><br/>I got a brief inventory of the damage I had inflicted on myself throwing my life away at the Fel Reaver. Two broken legs, a broken arm, two punctured lungs, a black eye, and a possible concussion. <em>(Possible? Honey, my head don't normally buzz like this, let me tell you...)</em> and then I slipped away again.<br/><br/>I awoke later, much later I gathered, and had to urinate. I could not speak, and I felt all trussed up...and I wet myself. I felt so humiliated, and embarassed. I felt like an enormous baby, and when it was found out the "tsk, tsk" of the nurse did not make me feel any better. I don't think I want do this again any time soon... I can feel the heat on my face.<br/><br/>My field of vision is severely limited, with only one eye. And the one side feels like a ton of lead sitting on my face. I tried to see where I was...and it came to me, I was in the paladin hospital. The wall coverings are familiar, now that I look at it. And that clean smell...like alcohol, nothing like a tavern.<br/><br/>Kind of tired now...maybe some sleep... <em>(the pen looks to have scratched across the page here)</em>

<strong>Kreindis Blazestride</strong><br/><br/>Cyaer has returned, and not untouched. He is severly wounded... I hope he can recover.<br/>I was nevertheless happy to see him alive at all.<br/><br/>I found inside me the courage to pull through and tell Tislina how I love her. My heart stopped for a moment when she said she felt the same... All in all, I was happy to hear her say that. I- I cant stop flitting my mind back to that moment for some reason... I hope I'm not going to have that moment stuck in my mind for the rest of the time I live.<br/><br/>All in all, the Fellowship is recovering well. Kel'tira found the strength to even train a couple days ago. I'm happy to be amongst such kind people. I can see my future with them for a long time.

<em>Tislina Dawnrunner sat on a plush bed in the Silvermoon City inn, thinking. A blue tome sat open to a blank page on her lap. In her right hand she held a quill, in her left she fingered her crescent moon necklace. She continued to mull things over for a few more moments. Taking a deep breath, she began to write.</em><br/><br/>So much has happened since I last wrote down my thoughts. I scold myself for not staying on top of this. I will try to cover the highlights. We rescued Kel'Tira from the clutches of Velin. She is currently recovering nicely. In the battle I severly burned Keyadrion, Kreindis's brother. Yesterday I killed him. A met a man who found this slightly amusing. A 'Dark Paladin' as he calls himself. While the remains were still smoldering, Kreindis came in. I felt horrible. The first reason being I had taken the life of a defenseless man. I know it was necessary and that he deserved it, but I still took no pleasure in it. I felt so guilty when Kreindis came in even though he insisted it was fine. We ended up going to what I like to refer to as our spot. <br/><br/>He... he preceeded to tell me he loved me. I told him I felt the same. It was so wonderful. He gave me my Moon crescent necklace, I have yet to take it off. Oh, things seem to be going so well. I hope they stay that way.

<em>Tislina sat in her room in the inn packing her things. Her mind was made up.</em><br/><br/>Pain...<br/><br/>Suffering...<br/><br/>War...<br/><br/>Why? Why are these things necessary? Why does the Horde fight with the Alliance? Why do innocents die everyday? Why must I watch those i care about suffer? Why? I do not understand. I ask myself these questions so very often. Moments ago I visited Cyaer. He was in pain, I know he was. He joked about it and asked questions and I am glad for that. I have made my decision. If someone walks up to me right now and asks what my greatest wish is, I will tell them it is to end the war between the Alliance and the Horde. That is a silly notion I know, but it would resolve so many problems. It seems impossible I know, but if I work hard I am sure I can make it happen. That is why I have decided to become an Ambassador. If I can get the factions of the Horde to trust me then I can begin to work with the Alliance. <br/><br/>I swear I will do all in my power to bring the two factions together. I will become the most renowned Abassador in all the Horde. I will use my abilites to help those in need. I will become the strongest mage I can.<br/><br/>My journey begins, here and now. I will hit road blocks, but I swear by all that I have I will never give up!

<em>A new small leather bound journal. <br/><br/>The script is not the same as the first journal, it is shaky and weak, very labored</em><br/><br/>My body is bruised and broken. It heals slowly, and the pain has lessened. It will heal, and I shall gain control of it once again. I will work it to its peak, and be prepared for anything.<br/><br/>My mind is another matter entirely. It is shattered, broken into so many pieces, and I am afraid...of myself. The fear grows in me again, and it wants to consume me. If not for the pain I feel in my body, and the exhaustion it brings, I would get no rest. My fear stalks me like a hungry lion, waiting for weakness, then it will pounce and tear me apart. And I will be undone.<br/><br/>I had visitors last night. My beloved came and sat beside me. Her presence calms me and quells my fears, she is a strength for me I lean on. I think of her light and that holds me enthralled. I ponder on this love we share, and her forgiveness shown...after so much pain I have inflicted...she still loves me. I hold onto her love like a lifeline.<br/><br/>Solorin came also. I felt a tension between him and Karamia, and a jealous thought comes unbidden to my mind, and the fear roars within me. I know in my heart she is mine, and I am hers, and we shall be a we...someday. But the incident by the bell still rings in my mind...his arm around her, and him saying she was beautiful. <em>ROAR!</em><br/><br/>The mage, Tislina also came. With news of a love in her life, and I am happy for her. Everyone deserves a love in their life, it makes life so worth living. Good for you, Tis!<br/><br/>And Kel'tira also visited. She seems different, how I cannot place my finger on it, but she has changed. But then after what my father had done to her, how could she not be unchanged. She seems reserved, and she looks at me coolly. Does she see through my charade? Does she know of my fear? I thought I covered it well...perhaps not well enough from Kel'tira.<br/><br/>Karamia brought me an old friend when she arrived yesterday, my old journal. I had thought it lost out there in the hell of Hellfire. Many a night, I read and reread my old entries and it strengthened me; and many a night I found myself pouring my heart and soul out onto its pages, opening my heart to a love I had only dreamt of, and now am a part of. I removed the drawing that Kel'tira had given me from the new journal, and placed it where it belonged, amongst the pages it had resided for oh so long. I shall place it in my bank, a memoir of my life...of my old life.<br/><br/>I am determined to win over this fear that grows in me. I shall not allow it to comsume me, I cannot allow it to devour me, I have Karamia...and I need her to know about this fear. She can help me tame this beast within me. I will be victorious...we will be victorious!<br/><br/><em>The great cat slunk to a deep dark recess of the mind, growling and grumbling, it licked its wounds and waited...it could wait. It would wait.</em>

<em>A goblin watched as the woman with the brown hair sat near the front of the zeppelin, her precarious perch near the edge making him feel a little dizzy. She didn’t seem to mind being on the edge of the great airship. He preferred more secure footing and was happy to keep both of his feet firmly in the middle of the ship.<br/><br/>Leaning against some rope netting, she looked out over the oncoming landscape—trees lined the craggy ridges and sweeping ravines. It was breathtakingly beautiful; it was a sight that she would not forget. Or at least she hoped that it would not be stolen from her by another blow to the head.<br/><br/>The Howling Fjord spread out in front of her in all of its wild and rugged glory. The air was cold and she was thankful that she had put forth quite a bit of coin to follow the shopkeeper’s recommendation of warm clothing. Getting a firm grip on the ropes with one hand, she leaned out from the airship, eagerly taking in the view. All too soon, the calls in came to prepare for docking and she reluctantly went below decks to collect her things.<br/><br/>***<br/>(New entry in a plain brown leather journal)</em><br/><br/>The Howling Fjord is spectacular. Vast with towering trees and cliffs overlooking the ocean, I find it beautiful. I am looking forward to exploring this landscape as I hunt for Nicias and I pray that I find him alive and well. He has been missing for a long time and I have my doubts.<br/><br/>As beautiful as it is, I have been warned that it is equally as dangerous. I will need to keep my wits about me as I make my way through.<br/><br/>The good news is that there was word of Nicias at Vengeance Point. They were able to point me in the direction that he was last headed and perhaps I will catch up with him quickly. Part of me wants this to linger so that I can stay here a bit longer. I think once this matter is over I may return here for awhile. It occurs to me that this would be a good place to think. The Light knows that no one in the Fellowship will miss me.<br/><br/>Night has fallen and with it comes a calm quiet that is peaceful and soothing. I should retire, I have a long way to go tomorrow over unfamiliar land, but I think I will stay here a few minutes longer.<br/><br/>(This is unsigned.)

<em>A new small leather bound journal.</em> <br/><br/>They allowed me to go and take a casual walk outside in the fresh air and sunshine. And only a few short hours later, I found myself back, exhausted, and gasping for breath. Let me explain:<br/><br/>I met for a short chat with Kel'tira and Karamia in the Hall of Respite. I walked the entire way...it felt good to stretch my muscles, and breath outdoor air again. Though I did feel a wee bit weary when I arrived, I sat on a divan and lightly scratched my precious Mia's back and shoulders. The topic was Viragona, and I'm sure my blood pressure rose to a high level...I have come to despise the woman, for who she is, what she has done to the Fellowship, and what she did to Karamia.<br/><br/>Afterwards, I had a serious talk with Mia. What it finally came down to was whether I was strong enough, brave enough and willing to be the Sin'dorei that Karamia had fallen in love with.<br/><br/>The lion never had a chance...my heart pounded, and my mind said yes - Yes, I am strong enough to stand beside my lady love, to protect her, and be brave to fight alongside her. And I will always be the elf she fell in love with...ROAR!!! Fear me, doubts; fear me, hesitation; and fear me, fear...for I shall not lose my love, my heart, and soul, my dear sweet Karamia!<br/><br/>I left there, and as I made my way to the hospital, I ran into the young mage, Tislina. I had only spoken to her a moment or two, and Kel'tira found me. I begged Tis' forgiveness, as I walked away with Kel.<br/><br/>We sat at a bench, as the sun shone down on us, and the birds sang...but my heart jumped and I heard no more as I listened to what she had to say. I reassured her that I was there for her, and would stand by her through anything that might happen. As it was, she also spoke with Aseria and Auxilia who happened by as we were talking. I think I was emotionally drained from her news and would make my way to the hospital.<br/><br/>And then Aseria had something to tell us. Or rather she went crazy. I know not if she was possessed or had truly gone crazy but she spoke as two instead of one. And she sealed her fate with me when she spoke of killing Viragona, so she could hunt each one of us of the Fellowship one by one without competition, and kill us.<br/><br/>I pulled out my guildstone and spoke to all the guild. I told them that Aseria was no longer be trusted, and that she should be considered dangerous to all of us. She was hereby called a foe of the Fellowship, banned from our Fellowship and her membership revoked. She merely laughed, and left in a ball of fire.<br/><br/>I did not realize how weak I was, until she left, and I crumbled to the pavement. I whispered to Auxilia that I may have overdone myself, and needed to be returned to the hospital. I was fortunate that several other Fellowship members were also near to assist me.<br/><br/>I fell in a heap upon returning to my pallet in the hospital. I barely had the strength to thank those who had helped me, when I lost consciousness.

<em>A new small leather bound journal.</em><br/><br/>Vigorous health, unbounding energy, and mental alertness are taken for granted when one is in the glow of good health. When you are laid out on your back, breathing is a chore, and your body is slow to respond to simple commands, you begin to appreciate those good old days of being in the pink. I overdid yesterday.<br/><br/>The nurses clicked their tongues, and shook their heads as they doctored me up, and left me to rest...rest? I should say simply, the dark void that is unconsciousness overtook me, and held me for too many hours. <br/><br/>When I awoke it was late afternoon, and every muscle in my body screamed out its anger for what I did to it. My head was swimming, when she came to check on me. She helped me sit up, and brought me a cool drink. This nurse had been a godsend, I remember her just barely when I had arrived from Hellfire Peninsula. But she was there to help me now, and I was very appreciative. I never got her name, she disappeared after a few hours, but she was there when I needed her, thank the Light for her administrations.<br/><br/>Several thoughts go through my mind concerning yesterday. Aseria. The fire mage...what had happened to her. I held her in high respect, as a mage, as a member in the Fellowship, and as a friend. She had always had a "fiery" personality, and it had taken a few encounters to have her grow on me, but now...I find myself at odds with her. And I weep for the loss in the Fellowship. But I must think of the Fellowship first.<br/><br/>Had I overstepped my bounds in contacting the entire guild concerning Aseria? I look back on the moment, and would not have changed a thing. She/they had threatened the very members of the Fellowship, my family, and I could not have that. I know of her power, and I respect it, but I cannot let someone like Aseria, even Aseria, threaten the Fellowship. <br/><br/>I was not afraid. I did not falter. I stood up to Aseria, tho I wasn't stupid, I acted with caution. I had the resolve to protect the Fellowship, and its members. And I was confident in my decision as I pulled out my guildstone, and declaring her banned and an outcast. I took on the mantle of leadership, and did not find myself lacking. I have my confidence back.<br/><br/>I will not take this life for granted again. I have been given another chance, and I will not waste it. I owe the Fellowship a debt I will never be able to pay, but I will uphold it's goals, and cherish each member as a friend, and as a brother or sister of the Fellowship. I respect them as individuals, as well as the strong group of companions they are. I have been blessed being a member of this group of people...my only regret, that I let myself forget this simple but important fact. Never again.<br/><br/>And I need to hold Karamia in my arms again, to feel her close to me, to smell her hair, and her breath upon my face. And I want, no need, to feel her soft inviting lips upon mine again and again, to taste them, nibble them, and kiss them over and over again. I need her to know how much I need and want her - now and forever - in my life and near me. Next time I see her, I will tell her in my own way, and she will hear my love, and devotion for her.<br/><br/>And one more thing, Fenris Isle. Auxilia had mentioned it with our encounter with Aseria. Where is it? And worst of all, I sent Aseria there. The Fellowship will need to be on its guard now. And we will gather together, and we will vanquish these challengers to the Fellowship. The Rising Sun Fellowship will prevail!

<em>The woman with the brown hair crouched down on the rock that overlooked a long ravine that lead out to the sea. She was curious as to what was there, the other views of the Howling Fjord had been spectacular and she had been more than eager to take in what she could.</em><br/><br/>‘It was all your fault.’<br/><br/><em>She shook her head, not certain as to what she was hearing. A soft voice was whispering to her, calm and certain in its tone. What was all her fault? She wasn’t certain if she were imaging things or not. She stayed a moment longer before moving on. She had to track Nicias down and get back to Silvermoon. She would have time enough later to return to the Fjord and explore it to her heart’s content—provided that Orgrimmar did not decide that she would be needed elsewhere.<br/><br/>Several days later, she lay sleeping in a bed at an out of the way inn in the Howling Fjord. A banked fire smoldered in the small hearth and she was buried deep under several layers of blankets trying to stave off the chill.<br/><br/>The sleeping woman frowned, then struggled against the blankets that covered her. She jerked upwards with a start, her eyes wide and fearful, her breathing labored and her heart racing.<br/><br/>“A nightmare…” she gasped out, trying to get a handle on the panic that had set in during that awful dream. “It was just a nightmare.”<br/><br/>***<br/>(New entry in a plain brown leather journal)</em><br/><br/>I am hearing things. Small whispers drift to me tunneling into my mind and reminding me of my failures. At first, I dismissed it as nothing more than my imagination but now… now it creeps around me and I find myself unnerved. I had a nightmare last night—I clearly remember the fear in which I awoke and it took quite some time to calm myself down. I did not go back to sleep that night.<br/><br/>I was there at the troll village, arriving too late to stop the executions of seven people. I saw the beheading of the final victim and her head rolled to a stop at my feet. Her dead eyes stared at me and her mouth moved, speaking in Kel’Tira’s voice—<em>"it was all your fault."</em><br/><br/>Suddenly, the head at my feet was Kel’Tira’s her face twisted and angry as she hissed, <em>"you did not stop them from taking me!"</em> The ground crumbled beneath my feet and I felt myself falling backwards. I woke up then. Covered in sweat, gasping for air and completely terrified.<br/><br/><em>The woman with the brown hair paused in her writings to close her eyes and take several deep breaths. She was on a cliff face near a path leading down to the waters of the Daggercap Bay. After a moment, she turned back to her writing.</em><br/><br/>On another note, I did find Nicias but he is not coming home. It had been a simple matter to find him—even if the travel had been a little tedious. Getting an opportunity to speak with him was another matter altogether. The orc commander had been quite clear in his tone: It did not matter that his wife had been injured; if she wasn’t dead, he wasn’t coming home.<br/><br/>I left not long after to make my way back home to tell the others. Nicias is safe for the moment, but heading into something the following morning. They would not tell me what. I asked that message about Kel’Tira be relayed to him, but I am not certain if they will give it to him. At least I am not returning with the news that her husband is dead.<br/><br/><em>She blew softly on the page to dry the ink before she closed the book. Tucking it into her pack she walked down to the waters edge and knelt down. Pulling one glove off, she touched her fingers to the cold waters, then dipped her hand in to splash her face.<br/><br/>Motion caught her attention—someone jumped from the cliff edge into the icy water. Abandoning her pack and glove, she slid into the water, ignoring the bracing wave of cold that blanketed her and pulled the man out of the water. After a few moments, he came around. Whatever madness had possessed him to jump seemed to be gone.</em><br/><br/>I had the strangest encounter today. I pulled a death knight from the water where he had tried to drown himself. He thanked me for pulling him out but he remains troubled. I suppose that they are all probably troubled in some form or fashion—I do not have any experience with death knights. I do not think my words helped at all; he seemed resigned when he left.<br/><br/>I need a new cloak…<br/><br/> (This is unsigned.)

The pages smell like lilac, salt, and a delicate rose scent.</em><br/><br/><strong><em>Kel'tira Sunblaze<br/></em></strong><br/>I rose early this morning, gathering my things slowly, carefully packing them away and returning the House's halls. I slipped into the routine easily, no one questioned my absence, nor did I think anything of my hiatus. It was to my surprise when one of my family, a distant cousin, slipping into my study. He was quiet, calm, and spoke with authority when he told me Talla had been lurking outside with a knife for the better part of the morning. <br/><br/>Waking nightmares plagued me for the rest of the morning, until I had finished what needed to be dealt with and stepped outside my study. Talla was growling. She looked like a feral dog, and Michael, the cousin who had warned me this morning, held her back.<br/><br/>Between the two of us, we hauled Talla to the Hall of Blood and the prison there, but I have not made up my mind what to do with her. Does she know? Is that why she was lurking?<br/><br/>Let me go back to yesterday, or, no, the day before last. That night.<br/><br/>Cyaer challenged a Fel Reaver. As far as I can gather, he was nearly dead when Mia found him and revived him with a combination of her love and the Light. The idiot. I had almost convinced myself that he simply made a mistake, was in the wrong place at the wrong time, but now I fear it was his own design. Suicide is nothing to play around with, Cy. I know this well.<br/><br/>Two days ago, I ran into Mia and Solorin in the Hall of Blood, Kreindis showed up as our conversation turned to death knights. Something inside of me broke, and I ran. <br/><br/>I made it to the falls near Farstrider Retreat before I collapsed, tired, in pain, and crying. Kreindis found me there, and I must have looked a mess, I did not want anyone from the Fellowship to find me like that, but he did. I almost poured my heart out to him, but not quite.<br/><br/>Mia showed up next, and she seemed to understand at least a little bit. I did tell her what was bothering me, I trust her enough to give her at least that much. I told her I feared I am carrying Velin's child. I told her I am torn inside, because whether I am pregnant with his child or not, I wish my husband were here. And that I am not sure I can bring myself to lose the child, but that I am not sure I can live with my uncle's bastard child after what I have suffered at his hands.<br/><br/>She allayed some of my fears, but not enough, and only raised more when she told me she could determine if I was pregnant. I said I thought it was too early to tell for certain, but told her she had my permission to check what she could.<br/><br/>I am pregnant.<br/><br/>If Nic were here, he would know what to do. If he were here, he would understand, would he not? If he were here, we could possibly tell everyone the child is his, and they would believe us, but would I? Could I love my uncle's child? Could I condemn a life simply because of the father?<br/><br/>Mia gave me a satchel of herbs, telling me to put them in my tea if I decide I cannot carry the child to term. The herbs will not suffice forever, though. After so long, the spells and processes to remove the baby will be horrible and painful and not something I am sure I can put myself through. <br/><br/>Yesterday morning, after a night of nightmares and little sleep, I ran into Mia and Cyaer in the Hall of Blood when I returned at the healers' behest. I slipped away to see the healers, and they only confirmed what Mia had told me the day before. I am pregnant.<br/><br/>So now, the question is what I will do?<br/><br/>Do I kill the child? Or carry it to term?<br/><br/>Light... Guide me, please. Bring Nic back to me.

<em>The once new journal is starting to wear.</em><br/><br/> <strong>Kreindis Blazestride</strong><br/><br/>Not much has happened since I last wrote.<br/><br/>I've told Kel'Tira I kept my promise to her. She also is now officially pregnant... she doesnt think she can handle it. The best I could to help her was tell her that the Fellowship would be there to support her.<br/><br/>I also helped Jahana, Cyaer, Auxilia, a scout named Kianesh, and Tislina with infiltrating Fenris Keep, where Viragona has decided to hide. When a death knight discovered where me and Tis were instructed to stay... my instinct took over. I ran right infront of her, creating a wall of plate between the death knight and her. The man transformed into a dragon and flew into the skies. Tislina took us back to Silvermoon with a portal, and we discussed what we would do next. Kianesh also joined the Fellowship that night. Cyaer had me protect Tislina for a while as she searched for Blackmold. <br/><br/>I'm with her right now, at the Silvermoon City Inn... she sleeps peacefully though I am awake. I havn't been able to help glancing at her from time to time, looking over her beautiful face. <br/><br/>I should get a little more rest myself, if she plans to go anywhere today.

<em>A new small leather bound journal. The script is strong and flows across the page, nothing like the first few entries...</em><br/><br/>My mind is in a whirl as to where to begin...I shall begin at Fenris Isle. It was a small team, just to go in, recon the area and the keep, verify the book was there and get out. It didn't quite happen like that. Auxilia lead the party going into the keep, and we split up to scout the entry floor. We found several light traps, and then on the stairs to the basement we found a higher grade of traps. Makes me wonder what she had down there.<br/><br/>Auxilia and I went upstairs to the next floor when we all heard someone speaking up there. We found Solorin, and the book. Something told me to take the book, but it may have been heavily trapped or ensorcelled. Then Solorin received word that an intruder was found on the grounds...my heart began pounding as I knew they had found Tislina.<br/><br/>I rushed as quickly as I could while staying in the shadows, and found her resting against the outside wall of Fenris Keep. I uncloaked and told she needed to run, and as I told her, I saw him moving towards us. Solorin. I stood between Tis and Solo, and told her to run, and I could hear her feet moving quickly away from us. Solorin wanted to know what we were doing there. And I told him. For a brief moment I thought I may have needed to pull out my weapons, but instead he brought out an amazing dragon mount, and flew off. I breathed a sigh of relief.<br/><br/>The team met outside of the grounds, and discussed what we had found, then Tislina conjured a portal for us to return to Silvermoon City. We figured time was of the essence, and Tis was enlisted to find Blackmold. I spoke briefly with Auxilia, and her news from Northend was good and bad. Nicias was alive, but he was not coming back. You got to love military forces, and their commanders. I fear Kel'tira will not take this news well. I didn't.<br/><br/>And I had a meeting with Solorin and Blackmold. Solorin mentioned Shadowfang Keep as their next location to move to. As Viragona will be cautious when she learns of us being at Fenris Keep. I learned a secret and promised to keep it. I trust Mia's intuition, and I am begininng to wonder if I can trust Solorin.<br/><br/>And I spoke with Blackmold about Sela. I could not tell him much, but I did tell him that her and I had met in Tanaris. I am torn, on the one hand, I hope he finds her and on the other, I hope he does not. She knew what she was doing, and entered into the deal with Mother with eyes wide open. Love makes you do heroic things. I hope Blackmold realizes this.<br/><br/>My final thoughts as I lay down to rest will be about Karamia and I on the beach, my arms around her, her head on my shoulder, listening to the waves lapping at the shore. And my heart beats faster, as I think of the arrangements we need to make, and the time we will spend in planning the wedding.<br/><br/> Our "some day" nears sooner than later. She will be my bride, I shall be her groom, and we will begin a new life together as wife and husband. I cannot express the joy I have in my heart right now. My soulmate and I together joined forever in our love.

<em>The woman with the brown hair sat under a tree outside of the inn on the Royal Exchange in Silvermoon. She considered it her tree, it was a nice shaded spot not far from the Fellowship’s Hall and the area was never crowded with people.<br/><br/>She was pulling things out of her bag, a journal, a pear (this went on her lap), a leather pack holding several small sharp blades, quill and ink (these went on top of the journal), and an aged bone pendant—this last item she appeared to not notice. The blades and pendant went back into the bag before she pushed it to one side and took a bite out of the pear.<br/><br/>A cold draft of air slipped past her cheek as the smell of fresh snow tainted the air. It was gone as quickly as it came and she raised a hand to her cheek, her lips curving in a wry smile. Déjà vu was normal for her. Hints of memories would slip in now and again and she was left to puzzle through it, knowing full well that it would never come back to her.<br/><br/>Leaning up against the tree, she held the pear in her teeth while she laid the journal on her lap and opened it. There were several folded pages in the journal and she carefully unfolded the first page and read over it. These were some of her first post-injury memories and part of what was written on the page she did not remember at all, but took the word of the medic who explained what happened to her.<br/><br/>She took the pear from her mouth, ate a bite and continued to read. Soon, she finished the pear and turned to the last page in the journal. Here, she picked up the quill and ink and began to write.<br/><br/>***<br/>(New entry in a plain brown leather journal)</em><br/><br/>I have thankfully been sleeping well since my return from Northrend. I think the stress of everything that was happening—with Kel’Tira, Cyaer, and now Vira—combined with being in an unfamiliar place got to me. The voices that I thought I was hearing are gone, the nightmares subsided and I am feeling close to normal again. The good thing is that I am used to functioning on very little sleep.<br/><br/>I do plan on returning to Northrend once this matter is over—the compulsion to go is calling me and I find myself looking forward to the return trip. There were a few items of clothing that I opted to skip over on my last trip that I will order at my earliest convenience—the shop keeper did not lie when he told me how cold it was going to be!<br/><br/>We have found Vira and more importantly, we have someone who is with her and relaying information to us. While there is some question as to where his loyalties really lie, there is little we can do about it. I have chosen to trust him in this matter but when the time comes to end Vira and her madness, I hope he does not decide to stop us. She has a way of enthralling people and while he isn’t behaving with the same despondent air that Aranthil was while she had him enslaved, it is quite possible that she has warped—or will warp—his mind somehow.<br/><br/> (This is unsigned.)

<strong>Kreindis Blazestride</strong><br/><br/>I talked to Kel'tira for a while a few minutes ago. She discussed with me about what she were to do about Velin's child, and I believe I've helped her come to a conclusion on what she will do. <br/><br/>Kel also wanted to talk about Tislina and I. I told her things were going well, and I hoped they would stay so. I was a little taken back when she said that, between Cyaer, Karamia, Tislina, her, and I, we may be having to plan another wedding soon. Its good to know that other people think that we are good together...<br/><br/>It seems like just yesterday I was being handed that guildstone and being welcomed into the Fellowship, being somewhat shy and not knowing barely anyone in its ranks, though it has been a long time.<br/><br/>Oh, memories....

<strong>Kreindis Blazestride</strong><br/><br/>Last night was a second Hardwrench Hideaway party. I had a few drinks of weaker wine, wasnt too bad. There was some people from something called "The Laughing Skull Clan". Kel got them to help in the hunt for Viragona. I met a member of the Fellowship called An'giel, she doesnt seem to be one to hold back on the language. The party was nice, I only wish Tislina could have made it.<br/><br/> Soon after I left the party along with the rest of the Fellowship that came I spoke with Solorin back in Silvermoon City. We ended up saying that we should fight alongside eachother sometime. I've always fought against most Death Knights I meet, not alongside. It would be interesting to see it. He also wanted to fight alongside a Paladin, instead of against one. He told me he died a Paladin by a Paladin. Traitors are some of the worst ways to be killed. <br/><br/>Solorin also told me why he wanted to be the one to personally kill Vira. He told me she had manipulated him using his feelings, and when it all came down to it she never loved him.<br/>I guess then that Vira is another cruel no-hearted bastard...<br/><br/>(( A quick sketch of a heart with a dagger through the center of it. ))

It has been some time since I last wrote in these pages to record my latest movements and goings in the land; then again, when we've become instilled with the drive to seek out that which is lost, we don't often have the mind to sit down and think things through, or to mull over the events that have occurred in our lives. However, that does not mean that I have not given thought to this miserable life of mine over the past weeks.<br/><br/>It's interesting really that I thought my life over when I found my wife's corpse lying on the ground of my home all those years ago, and that I became a creature of habit waiting for death. Oh, and while I wasn't entirely pleased with the circumstances of my execution, at least I no longer had to care about the things going on, let alone the pathetic squabbling which surrounded me on a day-to-day basis. Yet, even the sanctuary of death wasn't meant to be, for that blissful slumber was taken from me as I was reborn and thrust into this world anew to serve the !@#$% of the damned. Truly, what a joke; that life should persist still in the face of such misery and suffering...<br/><br/>This should have been fine; I should have continued to live out my existence uncaring and apathetic. However, I have Kel'Thul to thank for leading to my awakening. While the Elf didn't pull me from the slumber I was lost in, but my benefactor did open the door and ignite the curiosity that should burn within any with a waking mind. Kel'Thul gave me the option of seeing the truth, and that is exactly what I have done, but it didn't dawn on me until I came to the realization that Sela was taken from me, and just how funny <em>life</em> is!<br/><br/>People live for themselves; even when they seek the admiration of others, and their love, it is all for themselves, it's to make them feel good about themselves! People are willing to tell themselves anything, create any lie and repeat it like a mantra, just for the sake of being at peace. Yet, with so many kingdoms, societies, and creatures at odds...who are we to believe has the right philosophy?<br/><br/>Nobody...<br/><br/>The only philosophy that holds any truth in this world is death; that you can't outrun it, you can't escape it, death and destruction are the final end in this world, and it is the place where we all truly become equals. The Titans were wrong in forging this world from the ashes they found it in; they were wrong to bequeath the order of life unto Azeroth, when the natural state of the world should be chaos and destruction. The Titans tried to organize chaos, and their goal was meant to fail from the moment they set out to accomplish their ends! Chaos isn't what's unnatural, it's utterly natural - everybody in Azeroth is now living a lie; a false lie of hope that happiness can be obtained and held onto! I can't begin to elaborate on how...wrong we all have been.<br/><br/>It's time that Wrath took charge and led this world where it belongs. I was granted the immortality of Undeath for one purpose - to be a weapon. To be the weapon that sees this world devoured by the flames inherent in this universe until there is nothing but scorched rock in every direction. Only then will I be ready to die and take my rightful place among the lost souls who were never meant to exist!<br/><br/><em>- The pen seems to have been pressed down in great rage, and the paper torn where a signature should be left.</em>

<em>(Several days ago…)<br/><br/>“Are you certain?”<br/><br/>The blood elf nodded, his long blond hair sliding over his shoulder.<br/><br/>“Then we need to move on this while we have the chance.” The bald orc looked at the blood elf, “Do we have an invitation?”<br/><br/>The blood elf pulled out an invitation written on fine parchment. “I just need the name.”<br/><br/>“Who are we sending in?” a second orc standing with them scowled at the invitation. He hated traitors and as far as he was concerned, the blood elf they had been watching for the past three months was nothing but a traitor.<br/><br/>“The information will be kept in his private rooms, off limits and guarded.” The blood elf operative gave the second orc a knowing look, “Send in someone who can get easily get into those rooms.”<br/><br/>The second orc’s mouth twisted into a leer, “We send in the Rose.”<br/><br/>The first scratched his chin as he considered the implications. The Rose had all the qualities that they needed for the job except two: she wasn’t always discreet and she wasn’t patient. She had had to scuttle more and more jobs lately and this one he wanted to see through. They needed someone who could finish the job. “No, send in Scarlet.”<br/><br/>“Scarlet?” the other orc snorted. “I don’t think she can pull this off.”<br/><br/>“Don’t underestimate her,” the second orc gave the first one a level look. “Just because she hasn’t worked in this capacity before doesn’t mean she can’t pull it off.”<br/><br/>“Fine, fine,” the second orc waved a hand in the air and turned away. “Call them both in—two females are better than one.”<br/><br/>(One day later)<br/><br/>The woman with the brown hair stood in the Royal Exchange speaking with several members of the Fellowship. The matter in question was the warlock they had been tracking for quite some time now. The conversation wound itself down and as it did, she glanced around the Exchange. Her gaze fell on a familiar figure and she turned back to the Fellowship to make her excuses.<br/><br/>Her other life called and she hoped that it would not take her away from helping the Fellowship take out the warlock once and for all.<br/><br/>***<br/>(New entry in a plain brown leather journal)</em><br/><br/>I had another nightmare. This one not was as bad as the ones in Northrend—I was simply walking a path alongside a steep ravine. I could not see into it—it was dark and bottomless, but my feet were on firm ground and I am not scared of heights so I thought nothing of it. I walked until the ground beneath me started to crumble and I tried to jump away but couldn’t. The ground crumbled under my feet and I felt myself falling into the ravine.<br/><br/>That is when I woke up. I was safe but again, it took some time for me to calm down.<br/><br/>I need to put it out of my mind, I have work that I need to do and while I am questioning exactly what they are putting me into and why my precise measurements are so important, I will nevertheless see this thing through. Like before, I do not have the option of saying, ‘no’.<br/><br/>(This is unsigned.)
