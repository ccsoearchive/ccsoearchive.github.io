<em>A small leather bound journal, the cover scratched and worn, some of the edging browned from dried blood. Some of the pages appear torn and muddy, some appear to be water stained. A small worn sheet of paper is folded and tucked within it's pages... </em><br/><br/>I'm sitting in an old familiar place, the Royal Exchange parkway. The morning sun is warm, not too hot, and there can be heard the faint song of birds from overhead. I'm sitting on a bench that seems like a good friend. I've had several chats with my close friend, Kel'tira here, some very recently. I try to think back on those chats, the words used, the thoughts expressed, and the feelings shared. We'll have more of those here in the future.<br/><br/>I walked by the practice area, they're replacing the ones I destroyed already. I remember sparring a beautiful young elf here. Her eyes flashing, and dancing...she had won my heart that day, well actually well before that day. I stopped by the Silvermoon City Inn, and wandered about there a few moments. I thought of our times together, the tenderness and passion Karamia and I have shared here, and will in the future. I think of a house or cottage that will one day be ours...and the children that will play outside.<br/><br/>And lastly, I meander over to the Hall. The walls reverberate with the voices of those who have gone on ahead, and those that remain. I find a divan to rest myself on. I close my eyes and can see the fiery Aseria, and the always interesting Wynddsong sitting over by the pillows. The strong gaze of Varus, and Nicias watch over me as I look about the vast room. And I breathe a heavy sigh. <br/><br/>These walls hold a lot of history, have seen many a loud discussions, and probably a few tears and embraces too. The Rising Sun Fellowship will go on stronger because of the adversity, and teamwork of its members. It will go on, it must go on. I wiped the mist that had come to my eyes, as I walked out the doors.<br/><br/>Silvermoon City, my home...and the home of many Sin'dorei. I love this city, the people in it, and the friends, and family I have met and enjoy here. The Sin'dorei will rise again. We will not fade away as some think. We are a strong and proud people, and we will rebuild, and grow again. <br/><br/>I stopped to have my weapons sharpened, the wood had dulled them quite a bit. And I had my armor cleaned and polished. Appearance is everything. Some say we are too self centered, and vain. However, I beg to differ, the style and way a person carries themself says much about who they are and what they are. I laugh...<br/><br/>I know we stand in a hard place right now. Darkness has befallen us. But the sun will come out, tomorrow. And that darkness will fade away. We will laugh again, and enjoy each others company once more. We have hope and we have each other.<br/><br/>I need to step up and lead our Fellowship, in Kel's absence. It's necessary, and Kel would want it that way. Leadership is not my strong suit. But I will do my best, for Kel'tria, for Karamia. And I have a great group of people to help me. The Rising Sun Fellowship. What else do I need?

<strong>Kreindis Blazestride</strong><br/><br/>We know where she's being held. I risked myself today to heal her, just so she can live longer and give us more time to make a plan. I could only talk to her briefly, but.. She wanted me to tell everyone she was sorry. That its all her fault. I refused to let her think that she was the cause of all of this, but she wasnt letting up. I healed Karamia as well, which Cyaer may... or may not like. (( Because it only gives her more time to be tortured. )) I lurked for a few moments afterward, to get a good silent laugh out of his reaction, until he again ripped his blade down her flesh, before entirely turning it over and caressing her face and viciously kissing her. <br/><br/>That man... that monster of a man..... he makes no sense to me. I feel as if, as if he thinks its all one big game, and we're all his toys to manipulate.<br/><br/>I'm going to enjoy watching him die.

Journal of Karamia Dawnstrike<br/><br/>I sit here and dream, the hospital ward is antiseptic and clean. The staff is kind and lets Cyaer rest here with me. Gazing at his face, so innocent and so handsome. He has been through much. I must put my thoughts down now before I forget to note every detail.<br/><br/>Velin is dead, killed by his son. With a fury and determination I thought never to see. I am so proud of Cyaer. Not only did he focus and destroy the monster who tortured Kel'Tira and I...he did it with style. Like a dancer he moved swiftly and precisely. He has come a long ways since the handsome youngster who looked at me with the eyes of adoration. I do not think I could beat him in a sparring match today.<br/><br/>But at what cost? His eyes are full of sadness, a maturity and wisdom that has been shaped by the events that have transpired. I can feel his emotion and the guilt that scores his soul. I was stunned when he handed me a ring. We had talked of perhaps one day becoming wed. But the reality of it has made my heart swell in joy. He wants the peace and contentment of marriage. He wants children, bless his heart. My joy will be complete then. For now I wear a ring stating his intention.<br/><br/>My shoulder aches where the death knight Baelic drove his sword into my shoulder, his cruel and emotionless eyes stared into mine as he did Velin's bidding. I fear his sword was tainted and the wound is infected, the muscles are torn and disconnected. I pray for healing and the wound oozes. Where is Aranthil when we need him? This is not good, if I cannot get it healed I will be crippled. My left arm is my sheild arm...if I cannot take blows from an opponent I will be weakened and easily defeated. Perhaps the warrior Blackmold will help me to relearn my techniques. Once we get the infection out of it...and the muscles repaired. The staff sends healing energy into me every hour, hoping for the right combination of spells to knit things together.<br/><br/>Kel'Tira is in worse shape. Velin kept on her for hours. The vile monster deserved to lose his head! SHe is in dire straits and hopefully they will find a surgeon to repair the damage to both of us. I worry about her mind most of all. She was prepared to die to get him to leave the Fellowship alone. But I knew he would not let that happen. He relished her pain too much to let her die.<br/><br/>We will survive, the Fellowship is intact and stronger than ever. Praise be to the Light.

The plain black leather tome is locked in a chest. The locks are sealed and trapped. Only Jahana Falconblade has the keys and the means of opening it.<br/><br/>I cannot believe the events of the last days have left us with no deaths, other than that vile monster Velin. Death Knights, I have a fear and dread of them all. I do not trust them. Their endless hunger is all that keeps them going. Those who can control it are rare. They still need to feed that hunger like a thistle head needs to have their fix....but much worse...because the cure is death.<br/><br/>And yet I trust the Forsaken named Blackmold. I should call him by his name Elron, but it seems that Blackmold fits him better and he does not seem to mind. He thinks he can save that death knight who hurt Karamia and Kel'Tira. I had to confess to him...about my brother Jolandor. Though I did not get to tell the whole story, we were interrrupted by some new recruits. Some day I will have to confess to someone.<br/><br/>Jolandor was my twin...I watched him when he came back. He was not the same. He was cruel and heartless. He fed on killing and causing suffering, he seemed to relish it and enjoy the misery he caused. My dear brother, the one I grew up with, shared toys and learning...was gone. He had been brave and fearless, fighting for the righteous causes and protecting me. The Lich King took his memories away. He did not know me or care. His death will haunt me forever.

<em>(New entry in a plain brown leather journal)</em><br/><br/>It is over. We won; Cyaer killed his father and rescued Kel’Tira and Karamia. They are both safely back in Silvermoon in the care of the paladins. Kel’Tira is free from her uncle’s brutality, but not free from the memory.<br/><br/>The physical wounds are healing, but the memories… the memories are still fresh and causing a great deal of pain. It was difficult to see her like this. She is the closest thing I have to a sister.<br/><br/>Kel’Tira asked for me this morning. The woman I saw was just a shade of who she had been. She would not speak, she only wrote upon a notebook. I have to wonder if she did not trust her voice. She told me some of what happened—things that made me sick to my stomach. Things that I know twist like a blade in her heart and mind.<br/><br/>She wanted me to forgive her. She believes that everything that had happened was her fault, a chain that was set in motion because of a folly of hers. I told her that none of this was her fault, but those were dead words upon deaf ears. When she asked again, I told her that forgiveness was unconditional—she always had it and did not need to ask for it.<br/><br/>Now I need to find her husband, who has been out of communication for quite some time. Before I set off to do that, I must sleep. The few hours of slumber that I had last night will not make up for the two days of sleep that I lost. I only hope that if I find him, it won’t be another tragedy.<br/><br/>(This is unsigned.)

<em>A small leather bound journal, the cover scratched and worn, some of the edging browned from dried blood. Some of the pages appear torn and muddy, some appear to be water stained. A small worn sheet of paper is folded and tucked within it's pages...</em> <br/><br/>A warrior, a Forsaken, and a friend and member of the Fellowship - Blackmold. He was the general of our tactics in rescuing Kel'tira and Karamia. I trusted his judgement. He did not fail us. <br/><br/>Bogash put himself out in front of the enemy. He was a new recruit to the Fellowship, and he put his life on the line to save them also. He played his role well, and was not discovered by the Death Knight. <br/><br/>Auxilia, Jahana, and I followed the Death Knight along the road, and then he turned onto the grass of the woods. I had reconnoitered the area a head of time...where was he going? I followed closely, perhaps too closely, he stopped for a moment, then he spurred his mount to a gallop. I watched as he jumped into the Void. And he disappeared beneath the foaming waters and swirling mists below. We returned our findings to Blackmold, I could only think some form of dark magic was in play. I didn't put it past Velin to use such things.<br/><br/>It was decided that I would enter the Void to seek out Velin, and hopefully rescue our friends. The others would distract and kill any defenders Velin might have watching over his lair. The spider's web was found, and he would be stepped on and destroyed.<br/><br/>My heart was in my throat, as I looked over the edge of the cliff that came to the maelstrom of water below. I said a quick prayer to the Light, and thought of Kel and Mia, as I jumped into the storm below. I spun around and around, and the vortex pulled me below the surface, and as I began to panic, I found myself in a glooming cave, and rocky pool. I breathed a sigh of relief, and snuck over to a pillar of stone in the cave.<br/><br/>I was no sooner hidden in the shadows when two Death Knights passed me to the edge of the pool, and disappeared. I crept along the wall, and then I saw him...father, standing alone on some type of ruin. I stepped from the shadows, and walked towards him. I watched for Kel and Mia, but I didn't see them. My blades came to my hands without a thought.<br/><br/>I heard his silky smooth voice ask if I came to rescue the women, my only reply was that I had come to kill him. Then he jumped off of the roof of the ruin. I followed him carefully, and stood in the pool I had arrived in. I called out, searching them out. Some movement in the shadows, and a weak call, told me where Kel and Mia were. I tried to encourage them as I moved towards my father. <br/><br/>We danced, him and I, a dance of death. Our weapons clashed, each of us seeking out the other's weakness. And I would be the victor, there would be no escaping or running this time. My mind was focused on him, and him alone. I would slay this spider here, and now. For Kel'tira and Karamia.<br/><br/>He moved about, circling towards where his prisoners lay in the shadows. I told him that this was between him and I, as I pressed closer, trying to keep his attention on me, and off Kel and Mia. A slash to his chest brought his attention to me alright. Then he caught my leg with a lucky strike, and I limped in to slay him where he stood. My weapons were up and ready, when I heard Kel cry out a warning. I tensed, the blades held in the ready, when father came lurching out of the shadows, off balance, and he fell onto my blades.<br/><br/>I have watched men die on the ends of my blades before, and I watched the surprised expression on his face fade as his life left him. He fell to his knees, and I kicked him off my blades. And as one final security, I took my dagger and slashed his throat. He would not come back to haunt them ever again, if I had any say in the matter. I wiped the blade on his cherished red robe.

<em>A small leather bound journal, the cover scratched and worn, some of the edging browned from dried blood. Some of the pages appear torn and muddy, some appear to be water stained. A small worn sheet of paper is folded and tucked within it's pages...</em> <br/><br/>I arose, after defeating him. My thoughts only of Kel'tira and Karamia. I knelt beside Kel, I choked as I saw what he had done to her. She was barely conscious. As she opened her eyes, the one thing I dreaded, happened. <em>(They had said he and I looked similar, would they see his face and not my own?)</em> I tried to reassure her, then I called her the only name I knew was my own for her, "sis". She seemed to relax some. And I withdrew some bandages, and tried my best to bind some of the more serious wounds. I reached into one of my shoulder pouches to withdraw a vial of healing. Kel reached for it weakly. Then, Auxilia was there, and she helped administer the healing draught.<br/><br/>I glanced about quickly, and saw my Karamia. I came and knelt beside her, she was dirty and I could see several deep wounds upon her also. I bandaged her as best I could, and offered her a healing draft too. She smiled up at me and I could barely contain my relief. She suggested that she be untied, and I pulled a knife from out of my sleeve, and began cutting her bonds.<br/><br/>The next thing I knew she held me close to her, and kissed me. I could not hold it back any longer, as I wept in joy and relief of having Karamia once more in my arms. She felt so good. She said she needed to help heal herself and Kel. I nodded, as I looked around. <br/><br/>It looked like controlled chaos all about me. Auxilia and Tislina were aiding Kel'tira. A Death Knight stood like a statue in the pool, over my father's body. Blackmold was watching him carefully. Bogash was taking in some of the chaos, until Auxi called him over. Then I saw her wade across the pool.<br/><br/>I had never spoken to her about my plan. <em>(And our first time meeting was not on the best of terms - she stills call me "Nutter".)</em> I excused myself from Karamia for a moment and made my towards Aseria. She seemed distracted...I tried to speak to her, and asked her to burn the body to ash <em>(there will not be a return of Velin, as with Viragona)</em>. Whether she heard me ot not, I cannot say. I returned to the Fellowship members clustered around Kel and Mia.<br/><br/>And I saw the Death Knight holding the head of my father like it was some kind of grim prize or trophy. I told him to drop it, and now. Their eyes are lifeless, to me it was like looking into the shadows of a grave. He merely looked at me. I don't know what possessed me, but I asked for Velin's head, so that he could be properly buried...it was the Sin'dorei way. I implored him, and whether I reached some part of him that was buried deep within him, or what, he gave me father's head.<br/><br/>I rested Velin's head beside his body. And I whispered that he rest in peace. Why did I do that? This creature of evil, so vile, and yet...I walked away from the corpse. No longer concerned.<br/><br/>Aseria cast a portal to Silvermoon City, and we gathered up the injured, and walked into the portal. I rushed ahead to the hospital, and alerted them to the incoming wounded. And Kel and Mia were taken to be cared for and healed.<br/><br/>We rescued them. They're safe now. There is a long road ahead of us, of healing and coming back to some sort of normalcy. Light be praised!

<em>A small leather bound journal, the cover scratched and worn, some of the edging browned from dried blood. Some of the pages appear torn and muddy, some appear to be water stained. A small worn sheet of paper is folded and tucked within it's pages... </em><br/><br/>The room was all a bustle as the nurses, and healers tried to heal and bandage our two injured members. I slipped in between Kel and Mia, I watched as wounds were cleaned and dressed, as healing spells began to reduce swellings, remove bruises, and relieve some of the pain.<br/><br/>I closed my eyes for a moment as I thought there was no spell to relieve the mental pain and torment brought on by a sick demented mind. Torture can be excruciating in both the physical and mental aspects of its anquish. And these two had been in Velin's hands for too many days.<br/><br/>I remember the wounds, contusions, and cuts that my father had inflicted upon Kel'tira. I had bound her bleeding wounds, and tried to alleviate the bruising with a healing potion. But none of these touched the truly worst wounds done to her psyche. Had he pushed her to the darkest reaches of her mind? Had Velin broken her spirit, would she return as someone we would recognize?<br/><br/>I tried to reach out to her, I tried to smile and show a brave front to my Kel'tira. But only the Light knows where she is right now. There will be nightmares, and so much more. I am here for you Kel...give us time, give yourself time.<br/><br/>Karamia was awake and coherent when I moved over beside her. And we kissed each other, like there was no tomorrow, only today. I tried to restrain myself and her, as I remembered what had happened with Kel and Nic when he had been here. I was determined to be ban free and still see her. I watched the nurses as they glanced our way, and clicked their tongues.<br/><br/>Mia had dozed for a moment, and I slipped away to change and pick up something. When I returned one of the nurses was waiting for me...Mia was frantic looking for me! I hurried to her side, and I saw her tensions melt away. I held her close and kissed her, tenderly at first, but passionately as we continued to embrace each other. I pulled away from her for a moment, and said I had something to say to her.<br/><br/>These past few days and weeks had brought to me the conclusion that life is too short, even for a Sin'dorei. We had talked of eventually getting married...someday. And I was willing to uphold that promise, however there was something more. I told her that there was no one else I wanted to be with other than her. My love was strong, and I wanted her to have something to hold, to see that we are intended for each other...someday.<br/><br/>I was going to give this to her awhile ago...but it didn't feel right. Tonight, after coming so close to losing her, I felt now was appropriate. I reached into my shirt and pulled out the single diamond solitaire ring. And I asked her to marry me...someday. <br/><br/>Someday. To some people that may seem vague, a no time promise. But to Karamia and I it meant that it was only a manner of time. Our love was forever, and someday would be soon enough.<br/><br/>I must have been more tired than I thought as I climbed into bed beside her. She laid her head on my arm, and the other encircled her waist and held her close. I smelled her hair, and kissed her head. I whispered sweet nothings of my love for her...and fell asleep.<br/><br/>My future bride. My future wife. The future mother of our children. My future is there on her hand, a promise for someday...until we wear a gold band that tells us "promise fulfilled".

I feel as though I have come quite far since my rebirth into this world. It wasn't too long ago when I was nothing more than a shell of a being, an unliving creature with only one desire - servitude. However, things have changed, I am different - no longer do I feel suppressed by a terrible silence and require the command of a superior to order me about. As I sit here penning the events of these last few days, I can't help but finger the enchanted amulet given to me from the Fellowship and recall the terrible actions I committed at the command of that serpent, Kel'Thul. Still, in the end, it would seem that his foul magics served a greater purpose in reawakening my memories and emotions, for now I am free; I am free to make my own decisions and remember the drive which pushes us to take on greater challenges in our lives. Something that was greatly needed in recent events.<br/><br/>Thanks to the research Tislina performed, working off the tip that Cyaer gave her after being informed that his father was awaiting him somewhere in Darkshore, I journeyed to the Mor'Shan Ramparts, just at the border of Ashenvale and what is now referred to as the "Northern" Barrens. The ride was going to be long, so I spent time preparing for the journey, but, what I believed to be too time-consuming turned out to be most beneficial, for my allies managed to track down one of Velin's allies in Orgrimmar. As I prepared to scout the broken lands of Darkshore, my companions interrogated this green fiend and even succeeded in getting the location of their friends from the little creature. From what I've been told, he was quickly disposed of shortly after - based on how Tislina spoke of the creature, I'm sure it was the proper course-of-action.<br/><br/>We were in luck. This Giltrik was meant to have supplies taken to the Bashal'Aran collapse where our friends were located, and, in his place, we managed to send one of our own to meet with the supplies. The Orc Bogash proved himself as a steadfast ally to our cause, and pulled off his role flawlessly as he met with one of Velin's dogs. As the death knight parted with the supplies, our young shaman returned to camp, where we awaited word from the scouts I assigned to watch the food drop. What they brought back was most disturbing.<br/><br/>Cyaer, Auxilia, and Jahana followed after the death knight to discern the location of Velin's hideout, but what we were expecting to be a cavern of sorts, turned out to be the very whirlpool that the land's waters ran into. If not for the three of them reporting the same thing, I doubt that I would have believed a word they said. Apparently, the death knight simply rode to the cliff-side, and leaped into the heart of the spinning waters to be sucked into their depths. Unfortunately, we didn't have long to debate how we should handle the matter, for Velin took to torturing our leader, as well as Cyaer's lover, with renewed fury.<br/><br/>With time running short for their friends, I took charge of the situation and ordered the Fellowship to begin moving toward the waters edge. Whatever trepidation we had about entering into the spinning waters no longer mattered - if the death knight was willing to jump in, then we would have to follow suit. Even if it led to our deaths, at least then the others would not be forced to hear their friends screams of torment.

The small light black journal, hardly written in, not much had happened causing her to write, until now. She in the last few days had found more of a purpose then to just walk around waiting for reality to sink back into her head. <br/><br/>We met when he was in prison, for a crime he commited when not in his own frame of mind. I understand this, and wish that he could have been free'd sooner. I felt badly for him, being locked away like that. It seems everyones suprised at my compasion. As equally confused by my compassion. <br/><br/>As I spoke with him, his story thrilled me and entriged me. Causing me to be more and more interested. As I look at him, I see a strong, capable man who I yurn for. I realize that I'm not supposed to feel this way. I can't help myself. My feelings gravitate strongly to one side or the other. I have to visit the Apothecary more and more for my treatments. <br/><br/>The Doctor last night, told me I needed more of the treatment, that hopefully it may last longer. But these new feelings are rising to the surface and bringing more and more humanity back into my own mind. As I lay there on the table, my own body smoking from the electricution. My skin burning where the electrodes were placed. Thank GOD my hair covers the implants, my pauldrons, and my belt protecting the rods implanted with in my body. I layed there, screaming as they upped the voltage, feeling my mind, my fingertips, and my toes surging with Electrical current. My nails have turned black but to keep me humane, and keep my urges in check I must endure this torture.<br/><br/>After the treatment I was able to rise, slowly and carefully. But the higher voltage created an almost wall to keep the anger at bay. The Apothecary has been brilliant with my treatments and keeping me under control. <br/><br/>I sought out treatment last night because I felt something I've never felt before that I can remember. I went with BlackMold to UnderCity, to meet with someone they call the "Mother". She is like me, a Death Knight, Undead not a Blood Elf. But our training is both in Blood, and he struck a deal with her. I almost cried watching him strike this barter, I could have screamed and he would not have understood. A furture claim on someone means death and destruction. I had to do it. I had seem him controlled and punished for that controll before. I could not let him do it again. I tried to explain to him, like a lake, if you touch the water in the middle, the ripples go on and on and on until they crash upon the shore, stopping their brief life. He touched the water when he spoke to her, and bargained with her. The ripple effected me, I was the oh lets say lily pad in the water, that stopped one wave. <br/><br/>After wards, I went to speak with another recruit with him, and we ran into a new recruit. Blackmold walked off with this Jahanna, I dismissed it. But when I walked up the bridge, if my heart still beat I would have wished the Apothecary to tear it out to save me the pain. He sat so close to her, comforting her. I felt almost as if I was intruding. I even said as much, and found what I needed to quickly and left. <br/><br/>I almost ran to the Apothecary for my treatment, to have that vision BURNED from my mind. Torn from my eyes, as flames fueled my thoughts. I only agree'd to the new treatment to force the jealousy from my mind. What is wrong with me? Why am I jealous? He's undead, I'm reborn. We certainly can not have any relationship. Yet why do I enjoy him so much. I even touched his hand. I feel like I want to walk along the beach and see the sun around his frame. Watch the water swallow our feet and return to the sea. I don't know whats possesed me.<br/><br/>I must write about what I've done, I spoke with the "Mother" this morning. In hopes I could save BlackMold from any furture promise from her. I offered myself to her, a quick explanation as to why I would benefit her more. She thought for a moment, she laughed, and she agree'd. Whatever happens to me, I know Blackmold will be safe from her. That for now is what drives me. I must get ready for our meeting tonight now. I'm going to help him with a Death Knight who they fear is lost.

Alas, it seemed that we were found out! As our Fellowship drew close to the foreboding pool of water, I called for us to halt while Cyaer, Auxilia, and myself went toward the water's edge, but we were attacked. Velin's death knights leaped down from the cliffs overlooking the pathway down to the whirlpools edge, splitting our group in two and forcing us to fend off the fiends as Cyaer slipped past them to rescue his loved ones.<br/><br/>Not once did I doubt Cyaer's ability to stop his uncle - he was a man filled with rage as the love of his life was taken and brutalized by Velin, all for the sole sake of wounding his son's pride. In the final hours of Velin's life, his son reminded me of myself all those years ago in Westfall, his rage took me back to the moment of overwhelming anguish I felt upon finding my wife murdered by the very people I worked to protect. Looking upon Cyaer, I knew in my no-longer beating heart that Velin would die that day; no other end was possible for the man, save death.<br/><br/>In a moment that what was surely planned by fate, it turned out that Baelic and I were pitted against one-another. Initially I could not recognize him, but something told me that the figure before me was Velin's first servant, and once I convinced him to remove his helmet, I knew I was right. I stared upon the man I saw as my rival-in-action, for our only cause to battle was the conflicting aims of our masters. Unfortunately, I must admit that the man I had craved to do battle with for so long was a much greater threat than anticipated. As I prepared to tackle him into Auxilia's blades, for she had slipped behind him while his attention was turned to me, he lashed out at my ally in a surprise manuever with the hilt of his blade, catching Auxilia in her gut.<br/><br/>I worried for my companion, and, without thinking, rushed his position with my shield at the forefront, hoping to bash him into the wall and safeguard my ally. Unfortunately, he used his great blade as a bulwark, and repelled my assault. Gods, he was strong for that same maneuver somehow led to me crashing to the ground past him. Auxilia attempted to stab at him from the side, but her blades only grazed the metal plating he wore. He feigned a retaliation against my lithe partner, which succeeded in catching us both off-guard, and I am ashamed to admit that he was able to grab me by the hair; he then used my own body as a weapon, throwing me into an Auxilia who was just as surprised as I. However, I used the attack to my advantage, for I landed against the wall still upright, and used the new location to launch myself at Baelic - if not for my undeath, my collision with the wall would have likely knocked me unconscious. Luckily, such was not the case, and my shield slammed into him with all the fury I could muster, causing the death knight to be lifted from his feet and thrown into the pool of water.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what went through Auxilia's mind in those moments, but she jumped in after him, likely worried that he would survive to attack our companions on the other side. Trusting her to handle the death knight, and hoping he will be unprepared for either of us to follow him in, I ran back up the slope to help my allies handle Kreindis' brother. Fortunately, it seemed that my presence wasn't needed, for with three members of the Fellowship attacking him at once, he was subdued shortly after my own battle had ended, frozen in place by the Elven mage Tislina, a move I recall her using on me during my furious rage in the Undercity.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>Needless to say, our companions are now safe in Silvermoon City, their wounds being tended by the healers of that fine city. I am thankful that none of our order were killed during the events that have transpired.

However, as we escaped from the Bashal'Aran collapse, and Baelic stood over the corpse of his master, something compelled me to request that the death knight return with us through the portal created by Aseria. Baelic seemed broken without a master to compel him, and stood and talked as if there were nothing left for him to do with the eternity of life that he now has. I remember the same feeling, and it is a state I would not wish upon any. He and I share a certain kinship, or, at least, we once did, and I greatly wish to see him free of the enslavement his mind seems locked in. Unfortunately, I do not know if granting him freedom is even possible, for my own was forcibly returned through magic so dark that even I would not suggest its use on another.<br/><br/>During my imprisonment in Silvermoon City for attacking the Fellowship on Kel'Thul's command, the death knight Sela'Lindori approached me and expressed great kindness for me, despite my actions...and despite her own state. I was shocked to discover an Undead such as herself filled with so much compassion, so much respect for life - as a death knight, I cannot fully comprehend how she manages to refrain from taking pleasure in pain and death; she must be filled with great regret over her current form, for it's difficult to fathom how she must endure the pain that must follow from resisting her bloodthirsty urges. Yet, it is her passion for life that I feel may be the key to saving Baelic from eternal slavery.<br/><br/>Baelic's whereabouts had since become unknown after his master fell to the Fellowship, but I knew of at least one way to find him. With Sela'Linori at my side, I sought out the one they call the Dark Mother in the bowels of the Undercity's sewer. There are a great deal of rumors abound in the shadows of the Horde capitols of such a figure, tales that speak of the many eyes and ears this Dark Mother has throughout Azeroth - if anybody would know where Baelic had gone, it would be her; naturally though it came with a cost. Though Sela urged me to reconsider what this Dark Mother requested of me, I tried to reassure her that I would not allow myself to be used in the same manner which Kel'Thul commanded me, but she remained uneasy, and, to her chagrin, I accepted the Mother's terms. In return for Baelic's location, I have been forced to swear that I will assist the Dark Mother with whatever task she requires of me when the time comes for my services - a small price to pay, considering I would have never guessed to find my quarry at Uther's Tomb.<br/><br/>Sela'Lindori seemed hurt that I went ahead with my promise to the Dark Mother, and, oddly enough, I felt a certain shame for disappointing her so, but this is something I must do. I can't allow Baelic to continue on the road of abandonment he is lost upon; even if it means he awaken to become the killing machine he was raised to be, so long as he awakens to satisfy his own wishes, I will have freed another from the grip of mindlessness that he seems to barely fall into. Though, I do not do this without sanction of the Fellowship.<br/><br/>I discovered Jahana in the rogues section of the Undercity, assuming that it would be the most likely place she would be. I told her of my intentions, and, though she seemed wary, even beginning to recount tale of her brother becoming one of the monsters in front of her, she expressed faith in my judgement, for which I was thankful.<br/><br/>It seems that I'm now due to set out for the Plaguelands, and Sela'Lindori has promised to travel with me. It will be good to have her by my side. Though the amulet staves off much of my desire to kill, it is in her presence that I feel most in control, and aim to try and spare those who work against me.

<em>The journal sits on a stack of objects by a bed occupied by a restlessly sleeping red-haired Elf. Three books, blue, green, and black, and a wooden box are topped with a silenced guildstone.<br/></em><br/><strong>Kel'tira Sunblaze</strong><br/><br/>My life had devolved into pain, pain and darkness. Faces, time, names, words, none of it mattered to me any more. It was simply pain. Pain and screams, my own and Mia's.<br/><br/>I see now, back in Silvermoon, how the healers look at me. Pityingly. They ask me questions, and I do nothing but nod or shake my head. I do not trust myself to speak without breaking down into tears, or worse. I find I have no sense of myself, any more. I am not sure who I am, or who I was, or who I should be. A priest came by, with my journal and another and, upon my request, a blank one.<br/><br/>I do not trust myself to speak to my friends and family just yet, because I have no idea who I am. I am scared, and afraid, but it helps, to write. To draw. So I fill page after page with the images I do not want to remember, and while I cannot forget, and likely never well, it does seem to help.<br/><br/>The healers look at me and scratch their heads, wondering why I would choose to remain silent. The reasons are mine and mine alone, though, so I shake my head and shrug, writing non-answers and leading them in circles.<br/><br/>I do not want their pity. I want my life back.<br/><br/>No one understands. No one sees what I see when I close my eyes. No one.<br/><br/>(The next words are scrawled in large letters across the bottom of the page) <br/><br/>NO ONE<br/><br/>(The entry continues on the next page)<br/><br/>I cannot live like this... I need... I want... <br/><br/>What?<br/><br/>What do I need?<br/><br/>What do I want?<br/><br/>Nic? Yes.<br/><br/>Faith in myself? Yes.<br/><br/>The Light is still here, in my heart, I can feel it, and I have faith in the Light, but in myself?<br/><br/>And now... We face the pain we hid from for so long...<br/><br/>(The next entry is dated the same day)<br/><br/>Auxilia and Gear...<br/><br/>Baro'thul...<br/><br/>Cyaer and Black...<br/><br/>They all helped in ways, some more than they can imagine... I had to force myself to talk. Guild business cannot be dealt with on a piece of paper... so speak I did, and then returned to my silence. Auxi is going to try and track down Nic, thank the Light... Cyaer is like my brother, but he is not my lover, or my husband.<br/><br/>Gear is... amusing, in a way. He brought me flowers and fireworks, and promptly got himself thrown out.<br/><br/>Baro'thul has volunteered to act as a liason between our Houses, he managed to get me out of here for a bit.<br/><br/>Cyaer... Cyaer is... Cy. There is no way I can put on paper what I think, I do not have the words for it. He helped me face what I had hidden from. He cares, he is like a rock in a storm.<br/><br/>(Tears splatter the page)<br/><br/>Tyrael.<br/><br/>Tyrael was a rock. A bulwark. Holding us all down. Why now does Cyaer remind me of Tyrael?<br/><br/>Light... Light save me, help me, heal me.<br/><br/>I am done. Done writing for now.<br/><br/>Tomorrow is another day. Tomorrow...<br/><br/>Maybe...

<strong>Kreindis Blazestride</strong><br/><br/>Cyaer has done it...<br/><br/>He has killed Velin.<br/><br/>Now I can take a day or two of relaxation... My brother was severely burned by Tislina, which I'm happy to hear. I returned to Silvermoon with nothing but a couple cuts, nothing too severe.<br/><br/>I spoke with Tislina before we had even divised a plan of attack for the Fellowship's last chance.<br/>We first talked about the plan, but it began to wander around. Then, she said from unexpected to me, that she enjoyed speaking to me and felt like she could tell me everything. We both couldnt help but blush... <br/><br/>Jahana, Bogash, Blackmold, Cyaer, Tislina, and I divised a plan. We exchanged food to Baelic, one of Velin's former death knights. Our rogues tailed him out to a whirlpool which dropped into the collapse. I already knew of this, but I didnt tell anybody how I discovered it. I'd prefer not to seem clumsy like my death knight brother who should be about dead by now. <br/><br/>I wonder where the two death knights are now, anyway...<br/><br/>Thats all I have to write for now.. Im too tired to continue.

<em>A small leather bound journal, the cover scratched and worn, some of the edging browned from dried blood. Some of the pages appear torn and muddy, some appear to be water stained. A small worn sheet of paper is folded and tucked within it's pages...</em><br/><br/>My afternoon weapon practice is intense, though I destroyed no manikins. Several of the recruits felt it necessary to come over and talk to me. Some asked me questions about battle...I tried to answer them truthfully, and with graphic detail, give them a real feel for combat. Some turned green, some laughed walking away, and two stayed to listen to more.<br/><br/>I do not regal them with the glories of battle, I tell them of the blood, the gore, the fear swallowed to continue, and the tasteless food and the lumpy bed, if there are beds. They're only children, babies...I shake my head as I walk away.<br/><br/>My armor stinks, my clothes stink, I stink. As I enter the Wayfarer's Rest, "mom" is waiting. She begins her tirade of my not eating enough, I'm too skinny, and I need a bath. She sends me into a room where a hot bath awaits. This is why I stay here. I know she cares, and the rolls melt in your mouth. The hot water relaxed me and I fell asleep in the water.<br/><br/><em>Son, I killed your mother...I'm so sorry. I have your lover. Perhaps I can find men willing to use her. His voice is smooth, and silky...telling me I am his son..."my son"...</em><br/><br/>She's pulling my head out of the cool water, as I sputtered and spit. "Cyaer, what are you doing?" I can see the fear in her eyes, I have scared her. I calm her as best as I can. What the hell? What was that? He's dead...he's not alive, I killed him. <em>..."You are, my son..."</em><br/><br/>I dressed and went to talk with Kel'tira and Karamia. My mind is still wounded by the dream, as I walked in. Mia is sleeping soundly, so I decide not to disturb her. She seems so calm and restful...the same cannot be said for Kel'tira.<br/><br/>Even in death, he torments her. She moans, and seems in pain the short amount of time I watch her sleep, if it can be called sleep. I tried to calm her, instead I woke her. I talked to her and confessed my failure to her in protecting her and Mia. We certainly are a pair.<br/><br/>We talked for quite a bit, private thoughts, and concerns. She allowed me to look at her sketch book, and my heart went out to her more. Nightmares, each page a nightmare. Kel, we will get through this together, hold on, sis, hold on.<br/><br/>I wandered the streets of Silvermoon City, after leaving Kel sleeping restlessly. I'm not in a good frame of mind. I find myself not acting like myself, and running down the streets. What is going on? I am scared, and fearful. And find myself sitting beside Kel again. Did it really happen? Was I sleepwalking? The smell of liquor on my breath tells me the truth.<br/><br/>Kel and I chatted for a few minutes, but her strength was waning, and she finally fell asleep due to exhaustion, I think. I spent a few minutes looking at her. Even exhausted, she is tormented by the nightmares. Her eyes and lips move to unseen images, and I curse the bastard who was my father.<br/><br/>I moved to a place that placed me between the both of them. And I fell asleep.<br/><br/><em>"Cyaer, I am your father...and you, are my son. Then insidious laughter....you are, my son...</em>

A dark tome of leather, bound in nine bands of metal with dark runes skittering across its surface sits on Vira's desk in her Keep. Glancing at it she sighs, so many secrets inside. Her hand goes to the tome and she traces some of the runes that dance across the cover. What do they mean? It is a cryptic message that she has not been able to decipher. <br/><br/>The guildstone crackles yet again with the recent happenings of the Fellowship. Irritated she moves it aside, then the voice of Cyaer comes across and she listens to him. He has become stronger and more like a leader. Something in his tone of voice makes her realise how tortured and hurt he is by the turn of events.<br/><br/>Conspicuously absent is the voice of Kel'Tira. According to what she has heard, only in bits and pieces, the Fellowship is holding up quite well in the face of adversity. She hears the voices of Forsaken and wonders at the addition of other races into what was supposed to be a Sindorei Fellowship.<br/><br/>Tapping her fingers once again on the dark runes, she is irritated by a lack of a key. The tome has sat on her desk for months and she has yet to figure out how to open it. Every attempt has met with her being knocked to the floor or across the room from the protective magics.<br/><br/>Her thoughts are interrupted by an imp dancing in the corner. He sings a strange tune and his words in demonic seem to strike a cord in the runes on the surface of the tome. One rune glows briefly when the imp sings a certain verse. She straightens up and glances at the imp. "What is that verse you sing my little pet?"<br/><br/>The imp dances around and giggles, spouting nonsense and doing flips in the air. Frowning Vira sends a bolt of shadow at the imp sending him tumbling into the corner. "Tell me now or I will feed you to the Moat Monster in Undercity!" she yells at him in irritation.<br/><br/>The imp cowers in the corner and whimpers in pain. "Nine runes a chorus makes, the key is in your hand. Dark Light shines on a jealous heart. The bell no longer rings, but it holds a secret dark. Find the heart that holds compassion, fill it with despair. Unlock the rune of jealousy to break the seal of Woe."<br/><br/>Vira stares at the imp and nearly flies into a rage, standing up from her chair and marching across the room. "You knew this all and did not tell me? I should fry your innards as you watch still alive and screaming!"<br/><br/>"NOOO!!! You only see the first rune!! There are Nine!! You must find them all to open the Tome!" he scrambles into a hidden nook and cries as she stalks him.<br/><br/>"Nine? Tell me then how I can make the runes glow? Is that the secret? I must find their counterparts here in the land? How ingenious and insidious! Of course I shall use the Fellowship...they are so easy to manipulate. New members will not know about me unless they have been warned." she contemplates this new information as she walks back to her desk.<br/><br/>Fingering the Faded Wizards Hat, she forms a plan in her head. The Keep is in a remote area and she must make her way back to Undercity to find some one to manipulate. The Forsaken are often easy to use, they are often confused and need direction.

Blood dripped from my sword, as it did from his. The fight between us lasted for hours,<br/>the blood seeping from my wound I could no longer hold it. <br/><br/>The pain was unbearable, no amount of Holy light or lay on hands could help me.<br/><br/> I fell he bested me Blood Knight Solorin Sunsorrow. I am now a monster, living with this bloody curse!

<strong>Kreindis Blazestride</strong><br/><br/>I visited Kel today. She seems much better. I met a newer recruit to the Fellowship named Baro'thul, who seems like just my presence annoys him.<br/><br/>After I left, I heard Kel scream, and came running to find that my brother has been thrown in the prison there, but not after he was thrown into the room that Kel was in. I confronted him about something I've been meaning to this whole affair. I come back thoroughly stunned, and Kel eases me into finally speaking. <br/><br/>When my brother spoke, he said that a blind man could see I loved Tislina, one of our Fellowship's mages, who I am already good friends with. At first, I shut out this idea entirely, but as I begin to think back about it, the pieces all fall together. I truly do love her. Kel was happy to hear this, she looked much happier than she has in a week. We talked about it for a good 10 minutes before I left her to rest.<br/><br/>Gah, it feels like a jumbled mess of thoughts, sometimes....<br/><br/>I'll write more later, it is still early, and I have yet to do my routines.

The Death Knight sits in the Apothecare in UnderCity, waiting to be released. They gave her another fiece treatment leving her unconsious. But said it should hold for two days this time. Her skin tingles with electricity remnants, her mind numb at this moment. She thinks of Baelic. How she could bring this treatment to him, clear his mind, and zap him out of it! But he would not submit. <br/><br/>Her thoughts turn to Blackmold. How she adores spending time with him. He truly is a champion in her book. She laughs at herself, her school girl crush is truly got to be just that. He can not feel the same way about her. He is so distant at times, it could be his own afflictions that keep him at bay, or perhaps he still thinks of himself as Human, and doens't find her attractive. She sighs deeply.<br/><br/>Starting to pick up the quill, she chews on the end a bit. What will I do with myself? I must help Baelic. maybe then he will think I am useful. God know's, if he were to find out about the Mothers deal, speaking of that, what is she doing asking him for his necklace? Is she going back on her agreement? I must seek her out.
