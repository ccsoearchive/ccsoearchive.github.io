Zakia Sunblade awoke with a pleasant feeling on his arm, looking over he smiled as he looked at the sleeping face of Kye. He was happy beyond words, strange that just yesterday, he had felt like throwing himself off the nearest cliff. All of the emotions, the sadness, the rage, the self loathing, all of it had been taken away. Last night had been one of the most incredible experiences of his life, and what made it better was he got to share it with the woman he loved. He felt renewed, and reinvigorated, his desire to see the Fellowship restored, was back stronger than ever. They still had to find Fyn, but he was sure Shade would contact him if she heard anything.<br/><br/>This time thought he would not leave Kye behind, to go on some possibly dangerous adventure, no never again. She would either come with him, or he would stay with her, he would not abandon her anymore. He smiled lovingly at her sleeping face, as he remembered her words, "Love is a gift freely given, and I should accept that gift," he whispered. Yes, Kye loved him, and he loved her with all of his heart. There was only one final thing standing in the way of him being truly happy, and that was the darkness that dwelled inside of him. The time was nearing when he would have to travel to Pandaria to seek out this Du'long Firebrew, and hope that he could help him.<br/><br/>He looked at Kye again, brushing a stray hair from her face, and gently kissing her cheek. Would she go with him, on that journey, or would she allow him to go alone, but he didn't want to go alone, not anymore. He wanted Kye by his side in everything he did, whether it be battling his darkness, or simply running the guest house. He gently, and quietly extracted himself from the bed, and got dressed, it was high time he started pulling his weight around here. He checked the mail, and brought it inside, rifling through them, it was mostly bills, and the occasional junk mail. He would sort through the bills later, running the guest house wasn't cheap, they had to buy food, and drink, and various other supplies to keep it running smoothly. He sighed, and sat a table pulling out his journal, and began writing.<br/><br/><em> How am I so lucky, to have someone like Kye, she found the torn page, and had wanted to talk to me about it. I am not ashamed to admit I broke down into tears, as I told her everything, fully expecting her to leave. She did not leave however, she offered me the free gift of love, her love, and my heart soared through my sadness. She truly did love me, even after all I had put her through she still loved me, perhaps fate doesn't hate me after all. <br/><br/>No longer will I charge off on some adventure, at least not without her at my side, I don't know how well I can do the "normal" life, but I will do my best. I didn't think I would have the desire to settle down at such a young age, but if it is with Kye, I know I will be happy.</em><br/><br/>He closed the journal, and went outside, finding a blooming rose, he plucked it from the ground, and snuck back into their room. He lay the rose on the pillow next to her, and returned to the dining area, picking up the mail. "Well let's see what we have here," when Kye awoke, and came upstairs, she would see the rogue sitting at the table sorting through the mail, and jotting down their expenses.

<em>"I'm not sure what to think about what just happened," a voice spoke in a quiet location. Alone. Gems gleamed in various shades all around the cavern, various colors, illuminating what would have otherwise been a very dark place. These colors were reflects in a pool found within the cave, as was the woman who sat there. Her hair chocolate brown in color and her eyes as brilliant a fel green as the day she had joined the Sin'dorei, Zarina Dawnstalker sat and stared at herself, knowing she couldn't write about this.<br/><br/>Varus would find and read her diary and be concerned.<br/><br/>"I met someone today. A very powerful being, far more powerful than I could have thought possible. I do not think he's like any warlock I've ever seen. No. I wonder if he's a warlock at all. He wears a heavy chain mail in addition to robes. Power oozes so thickly off of him, it's hard to not choke on it."<br/><br/>A drop fell from the ceiling of the damp cave into the pool and her reflection shattered into ripples. The warlock smiled faintly as her image was distorted, continuing on, "I find myself shaking when I think about him. There's something there. If I can harness the powers that he has, who knows what I could accomplish. What I can do. What I can prevent…" <br/><br/>Her hand went to her flat stomach. The hints of her pregnancy long gone, leaving her just as slender and even more hollow inside than before. As if Astinos had taken part of her soul with him.<br/><br/>"I met him while searching for this gem cave. It proved a fruitful search, but I hadn't thought to sense a demonic essence throughout the caves. I found him because he didn't ward the mountain where it was shallow. I don't know what he expected, the cave itself was obviously shallow and a demon of that size gives off a pretty obvious signature. But, had I not been there, I wouldn't have known. I wouldn't have taken down his wards and found him. I want his power, but I'm… terrified…"<br/><br/>Her hands clasped before herself as she forced the word from her lips. Licking them after having said that, she could almost taste the fear on her own breath.<br/><br/>"I've finally… changed. I think. Not many would notice. I don't want them to notice. I want for them to believe that I am who I say I am. There is nothing else. And if anyone had looked, they would have found nothing else. But I think I've changed, at least a bit. There's a small room in me, just a small amount of space. I don't know if it will grow. But I do know it is Varus who holds that small space. He's more than earned it. I've been more than a selfish !@#$% to him. I don't know why he's still with me…" her gaze focused on her own face as the ripples faded, leaving her to face herself again.<br/><br/>"Not that anyone else has the right to say such a thing," she sneered suddenly before trailing off into a fit of angry curses and vows. Still, her hands shook as she clasped them tighter together. "No one else has clean hands. What was that odd saying Shade said? Let he who has not sinned cast the first stone?" she laughed harshly, only to grow silent again.<br/><br/>"That one. She's nothing special. But she's one of the few who's actually taken steps to making this 'Fellowship' work. It's more than obvious, when she spoke to me. She would speak to others. She would try to work something out. I've listened to her doing such. Trying to make everything right. I wonder why. Why is it so important for her when no one else can be asked to do it. I think they do need a leader, they just don't know what to do with one… Maybe she does. I feel bad for Ratheron. I wonder if anyone's even asked for him to reconsider?" she snarled slightly. "If they haven't, it only confirms what made him step down…"<br/><br/>Zarina lifted her eyes to the various gems scattered throughout the cave. One of them suddenly overloaded and cracked, its light darkening. She grew silent for a few seconds, then remembered her original train of thought.<br/><br/>"I see two options before me. The first is to follow this man and try to gain information from him, trusting that nothing will happen. The second is to leave Varus now before anything happens, in case I need to save my skin. There is one path behind me. I do not look back very well, and I retreat even worse. I want to move forward. I want to be stronger."<br/><br/>She relaxed her hands before herself and bowed her head to rest against her hands, burning her face into them as she closed her eyes.<br/><br/>"I am convinced that no matter what I do, I will be causing Varus great pain in the future… I think that's why I believe I've changed. It's hard to breathe, to think about it. I never had trouble before. I would attack him. If he didn't counter in time, then he was too weak to look at… Now… Now? Can I even attack him?" she trembled silently.<br/><br/>"Can I hurt Varus?"</em>

Jana sat near the gravestone that was the final resting place of one of her dearest friends. She wanted to cry, she wanted to scream, but her mind was numb. Seeing the strife in the Fellowship hurt her more than she wanted to admit. Not for her sake, but for the sake of one who was gone.<br/><br/>Faeira leaned against the wall in the shadows and watched Jana. The images that floated around the Farstrider scout were confusing to Fae. One stood out though, a tall and graceful paladin, a female with red hair, surrounded by Light and standing there with her hand on Jana's shoulder. As Fae watched the Light faded from the paladin and then returned, as if the Light was being manipulated.<br/><br/>The scene made no sense to Fae. She did not know either Jana or the image of the paladin. In her concentration to puzzle it out she uttered a simple phrase, not even aware she did so out loud. "The Light does not abandon it's Champions."<br/><br/>As quickly as she said it she clapped a hand over her mouth and got up to run. Scared out of her wits that she had been overheard. She ran as fast as she could into the safety of Silvermoon City, blending into the shadows and hiding once more.<br/><br/>Jana blinked in confusion and merely watched the frail priestess run. She had no clue what it was all about.<br/><br/>------------------------------<br/><br/>In the shadowed recess of the Hall of respite she watched them. Each had a shadowy presence or aura about them. One talked more than the others. Someone called her Shade. Fae watched in fascination as Shade talked to each one, telling them of the Fellowship and how it meant so much to the future of the Sindorei. She spoke of many things, but wanted to hear their stories. Fae did not pay a lot of attention to what was said, it was kind of blurry seeing things through the sheer curtain. But she thought she could see shackles on the wrists and ankles of Shade, and some kind of collar around her neck, but as Fae stared at them they faded away. <br/><br/>There was a darkness covering Shade, as if something was locked inside of her and struggling to get out, but held by something. It reminded Fae of a bird trapped in a cage.<br/><br/>Another woman sat near Shade, and Fae heard the blonde elf beside her call her Kye. Even from here Fae could see the bond of affection and love that bound those two together. Kye called him Zack, and Fae could see the darkness inside of him, he struggled to contain it. Kye had a rather strange wisp of a ghost floating beside her. It looked to be a child, a baby girl. As Fae watched the child opened its mouth in what would have been a pitiful wail. Holding its arms out to Kye and sobbing as the woman ignored the baby and focused on Zack.<br/><br/>The most frightening thing Fae saw as she sat in the relative safety of the curtained alcove, was the tall elf someone called Varus. He literally commanded the attention of those around him, even when he did not speak. The wraith behind him was shrouded in darkness, a hooded cloak covered it to the floor. On it's back was a Scythe that gleamed red. Fae would have thought it was the spectre of Death itself, but it did not seem about to take the life of the elf, merely floating behind him. As she gazed at it the spectre turned to her and she saw red eyes stare back at her. Fae felt a chill run down her spine. <br/><br/>She tore her gaze from the spectre to gaze at the next speaker, an Undead woman who had a strange dream to tell of seeing her mother alive and well and herself as well. The woman was called Daenith, and she seemed unaware of the spirit of the elf that floated beside her and patted her shoulder with a comforting hand. <br/><br/>Fae did not understand any of this and felt out of place. She was not part of this Fellowship, but something told her she would see more of them soon.

Kelden Starstrider sat at the bar, at the Fellowship's guest house in New Dawn, his best friend Zakia Sunblade, behind the counter cleaning glasses. The hunter had come here, partly to see Zak, and partly because he wanted a bed to sleep in tonight, he had told Zak of his meeting with Amythria, and their meeting of Fae. Zak just smiled as he listened to his friend, once Kelden was done speaking, Zak put the glass he had been cleaning behind the counter. He smiled at his friend, "Sounds like the two of you really hit it of, I have not had much opportunity to speak with Amythria, but if she is Shadow's sister she must be a good person."<br/><br/>The hunter smiled, "She is, but she seems to be a little... down on herself I guess, it hurts my heart when she speaks of her never finding love." Zak nodded, he knew his friend well, which included his belief that there was love out there for everyone, it was just not always as easy for some to find. Kelden sighed, as he finished his glass of whiskey, "Still despite that I think she she took a liking to me. I could just be assumin', but when someone asks if they can talk to ya again, I take that as a sign of likin' someone."<br/><br/>Zak chuckled, "I agree, but it doesn't surprise me you were always good at making friends, and when you still lived in the city you had hundreds of girls pining for you. I was never able to determine if they were stupid, or blind," the rogue laughed as his friend punched his shoulder. Zak's words were only in jest, and they both knew it.<br/><br/>Kelden smirked, "I seem to remember my cousin havin' a crush on ya, when we were youngins'. Don't think she ever worked up the courage to tell ya though, pity, I would have loved havin' ya in the family."<br/><br/>Zak smiled fondly, "Had Bryah worked up the courage, I have no doubt we would be together to this day. Still I love Kye, and I am not going to dwell on what ifs anymore, I have no doubts that Kye was that one woman for me to find. Still I love Bryah like a sister, Light knows she is ten times better than Jaella."<br/><br/>Kelden laughed, "Jae is just different, I know she cares about you a great deal, though she doesn't show it, you two are twins after all. Well I guess I had better turn in for the night, thanks fer the drink Zak."<br/><br/>Zak stopped the hunter with a hand on the shoulder, "What are you going to do about Amythria?"<br/><br/>Kelden smiled, "I am going to try to break down these barriers she has regarding love. Not saying I am going to try, and make her fall fer me, but I want her to see that love is possible fer everyone."<br/><br/>Zak frowned, :And if by some twist of fate she does fall for you?"<br/><br/>The hunter smiled, "Well then, in that case both of us comin' to the Fellowship will have been worth it, night Zak." Climbing the stairs the hunter wondered, about Zak's question, what if by some twist of fate Amythria fell for him. It was too early to say what would happen, for now he was content with having her as a friend, he would let fate sort out the rest.

"What do you think?" Shadow looked at Amy with a concerned frown. Her fingers lightly brushed through Ratheron's hair, which fell messily about his face and shoulders. With his ponytail undone, the dark hair could flow freely in every direction. Amythria herself sat on the edge of the bed with her hand on the man's chest. The monk had never fully grasped the powers her sister held, but now was one of the times when she regretted not pursuing a career as a wielder of magic. Not to say that she had lost that knowledge, she could still work basic spells, but she refused to do so. It wasn't monk-like.<br/><br/>"I'm not certain," the response startled Shadow. She was so used to her older sister having all of the answers. Whenever the younger woman had a question, it was always Amy who had the answer. The fact that she didn't lord this knowledge over people, but simply lived as someone who could find these things out, or already knew them, made Shadow comfortable to ask the woman anything. To have her actually not be able to figure out what was going on was something that rarely happened. "This will take some time… He was badly damaged."<br/><br/>"He's going to live, though…" Shadow's tone wasn't certain, but she had to state it, not ask it. Everything would be alright. That was what Ratheron always told her. The young monk's gaze dropped to her mentor's relaxed face. Usually it held hard lines or softened in laughter. To see him sleep wasn't something that she got to see often, but she wished he would wake up and yell at someone, that he would speak mysteriously or pretend that he wasn't smiling in amusement at her. <br/><br/>"Probably," Amy replied, her tone lacking for any hint of caring one way or another. Her attention was focused completely on Ratheron, and though Shadow should have felt upset that someone would take that kind of a tone over her husband's wellbeing, it was also something she was used to. Amythria often spoke of people as if they were things. Ratheron wouldn't be any different, but it still made her hands clench. <br/><br/>"Keep looking, please," Shadow whispered and the mage nodded. Well into the night, the two examined the man's body for hints, Amy being particularly quiet and Shadow looking exhausted from lack of decent sleep. Too afraid to falling asleep and missing him waking up. The stress of not having her lover there to comfort and guide her was something that Amy, too, noted in her sibling. Though she didn't say anything or try to reassure Shadow. <br/><br/>There was no point in saying hollow words when Amy knew she could be disproven if Ratheron did slip away. Her jaw clenched silently as she looked in irritation at Ratheron, as if annoyed with the man for putting Shadow through this. Though her thoughts drifted to other things on occasion. <br/><br/>Things could get messy.

The grave was decorated with a fresh bunch of flowers, Jana stopped to wonder who had put them there. Was someone else thinking of the one who had passed? She scratched her head in puzzlement. But she had no clue and shrugged it off. <br/><br/>Making her way to the settlement she found the notice on the board. "So she wanted some help making things work? I had better check the Inn and see if anyone is around to get things going. I wonder if anyone will help me with it?"<br/><br/>Jana made her way to the Inn and sat at the bar. Smiling at Zak she could not help but notice the worry lines on his face. "What has you so worried, Zak? Things will work out, they always do. Have Faith, the Fellowship will survive. All things change over time. We must keep trying for the sake of the future generations. Have you seen Shadow or Ratheron the last few days? I know they were planning on a honeymoon. I thought it would be nice if we threw them a reception. But I wanted to get everyone on board with it. Maybe we could surprise them?"<br/><br/>(The Farstrider had no idea what had happened to Ratheron. It might be a good idea to tell her about it, if he knew. Also where he is currently would be a good thing to post in the thread. If we cannot rp in game at least post something in here. This will be deleted when I get more info.))

Zakia Sunblade lay in his bed, one arm around Kye, while the other was behind his head, being used as an extra pillow. He had finally stepped foot on Pandaria for the first time, while looking for Fyn, thankfully they had found her alive. He state of mind however had not been good, he felt totally useless, as Dalen, Shade, and Carinoth calmed her down with words. He had said little preety much echoing whatever Dalen said, he was a man of action not words, he supposed Fyn was lucky she had Carinoth, had he been in Carinoth's shoes he would have just ran to her and embraced her tightly. He knew though that, that would have more than likely made her bolt, but besides his feeling useless, it was her words of, "feeling nothing," that had shaken him.<br/><br/>It brought memories of the Siege unbidden to his mind, memories that had been fairly vague until that point, he remembered the emptiness when he had let the darkness loose. Even now it made him shudder, not feeling, being cold, and calculating, and unmerciful it horrified him. To make things worse something about Pandaria had made the darkness stronger, he had heard tales of the beings called Sha, could it have been one of theer influence that made the darkness stronger? He didn't know, but when he returned to the guest house he was mentally exhausted, he didn't know just how much until he collapsed, and was helped into the house by Shade, and Kye.<br/><br/>They had insisted he get some sleep, he should have known better, than to try without Kye next to him in his arms. The nightmare had been brutal, he had seen burning buildings, rivers of blood, and corpses, corpses everywhere. Hanging from rooftops impaled on spikes, or just hacked to pieces, the entire dream had been red, from flame, and blood. In the middle of it all he saw himself, cackling like a madman, as he chopped another innocent to pieces, none were shown mercy, even women, and children were just fodder for his blades. Just before Kye woke him up, he had seen himself stalking towards the guest house, with murder in his eyes, thankfully he did not have to see what would have happened.<br/><br/>That dream had been the last straw, he couldn't put it off any longer, he had to return to Pandaria, he had to find this monk who could apparently help him, this Du'long Firebrew. He had said as much to Kye, Light how he loved that woman, she immediately offered to go with him, and he knew he needed her to. Not only because he promised not to leave her behind anymore, but because she was his heart, and soul, she gave him strength when he had none left to give. He looked over at his love, and smiled, kissing her lightly on the cheek, whispering, "After this is over Kye, I have a very important question to ask you. Until then just know I love you," he laid his head back on the pillow, and wrapped his other arm around her, drifting off into a peaceful slumber.

Mists of black and green swirled in Fynnariel’s mind. With them memories were carried…memories of people and places and smells. They contorted themselves into a brutal nightmare, most times nonsensical and others the memory its self was nightmare enough. She thrashed in the bed as the dream intensified, until she woke herself up. <br/><br/>Fyn’s eyes flashed open; they took time to adjust to the darkened room. Her body remained still and she struggled to catch her breath. Fynnariel couldn’t remember where she was. Something was clutched tightly in her hand; it was the hand of someone else. The dim light that filtered through the room was enough for her to make out the form of Carinoth beside her. She released Car’s hand and sat up.<br/><br/>The events of the day before crashed through her skull in blurry images and a headache came along with it. Head in her hands, Fyn tried to focus. It was as though she was seeing what happened through a filter. The worried face if Zakia, Carinoth’s tears. The words of Shade and Dalen echoed through her mind. Something tugged inside of her, but she didn’t have time to dwell on it. Another need surfaced sending pains through her body. <br/><br/>Fynnariel slipped out of bed. She was wearing only a nightshirt. Dimly she wondered if Carinoth had got her out of her muddy clothes while she was passed out. Fynnariel moved silently to the door, she glanced once more at the still form of Carinoth and disappeared into the darkness of the house. <br/><br/>The guest house was quiet. Fyn was on edge as she snuck down the stairs. She found where Kyetah kept the liquor easy enough. The concern in Kye’s eyes danced through Fyn’s head. She gasped as her head spun and reached for a bottle. Suddenly, something cold and metallic tapped her hand and the bottle dropped to the floor with a crash. <br/><br/>Fynnariel was more concerned about the liquor than what made her drop it so as she reached for the broken bottle she did not have time to dodge the foot that planted its self in her chest. The huntress sprawled back across the floor, slicing her hand on glass. Fyn’s head spun, face morphed into a look of rage.<br/><br/>A woman stood before Fyn and made a ‘tsking’ sound. The dim light touching her hair and making it glitter like rays moonlight. Her expression was grim and she held both blades in her hand at the ready. “Your friends go through all this trouble to help you and this is how you return the favour?”<br/><br/>“Vanwë…” Fyn growled the name and the tiny woman tilted her head to the side with a smirk in response. “They would never have known if you hadn’t-”<br/><br/>((1/2))

“You forget love.” Vanwë whispered, her voices pirate nature adding a growl of its own. “I was there, I know what happened to you the last time…and I know who you are from before the last time.” Fyn looks ready to hurl an insult but Vanwë interrupts her. “Here’s what’s going to happen tonight. You are going to fix up that gash on your hand and go back upstairs to your brooding hero or I am going to wake up this entire house.” She looks around thoughtfully. “If we haven’t already.” She seems to think of something else. “Oh yes…and please do not call me by <em>that </em>name.”<br/><br/>Fynnariels eyes drift to the stairs and she flinches slightly. Her body is shaking once more and she is having problems concentrating. “Why do you even care…?” She gasps from the floor.<br/><br/>“You know why.” Vanwë whispers quietly. She watches Fyn’s every move. “When you flinched just now…that emotion you’re repressing? It’s called guilt.” Fyn glowers up at the woman. Whisper tosses her a bandage but doesn’t move to help, her weapons still drawn at the ready. “And regret.”<br/><br/>Wrapping the bandage around her hand was a difficult task. The shakes had set in and Fyn felt cold. <br/><br/>“Aye, regret.” Whisper continued. “If you take one of these bottles, and drown your misery you will run off again. Probably try to kill yourself like the last time and I will be left to pick up the damn pieces.” Whispers eyes drift up to the suite if only for moment. “Do you want your last regret to be wounding the best thing that ever happened to you? To be wounding the family you have made here?”<br/><br/>Fynnariel says nothing, she looks at the floor. She is a wretched sight to be sure.<br/><br/> “I’m going to be here all night love. You come down those stairs again, I’ll take a foot.” Whisper advances slowly and points one blade at Fyn and the other at the stairs. “Now, get going…” As Fyn climbs the steps, each movement uncoordinated and shaky, Whisper adds quietly. “Speak with that pretty boy Dalen, he seems to know what’s what and is a superior of sorts for Farstriders right? And drink some damn water will you!!”<br/><br/>Fynnariel cringes and looks back. The tiny blood elf is gone. If it wasn’t for the fact the broken bottle was cleaned up off the floor, the huntress would have wondered if Whisper was ever there to begin with. Staggering with each step Fyn made her way back to the suite. She climbed shakily back into bed beside Carinoth and again took his hand in hers in a near death grip. It would be long before the Farstrider fell back into a fit full sleep.<br/>((2/2))

What is trust?<br/><br/>It is something I scarcely have myself. It's a wonder anyone else puts any faith in me.<br/><br/>But I accept it. I have to move as I believe to be right. My mind is guided. I know of these things. I know of that hollow, empty feeling. More than I care to let on. Just like how Silver saved me, maybe I can help as well. <br/><br/>I push them too quickly. I relaxed a bit and let Carinoth savor holding his lover, even as the cold rain washed over us. Even as I watched her serpent, eyeing the lot of us. And I knew that she would want to bolt. The longer we sat out there, the more likely it was that she would change her mind. I guided them along gently and let them ride my Fire Hawk home, for his phoenix was too small to be ridden by two people.<br/><br/>It's a fine balance I'm trying to find. Between herding cold and shocked people. Zakia, I sent him to get some water. It will be needed to stave off the effects of a hangover. Water's the best solution, as well as vitamins and minerals. Alas, we don't have much of the latter in any form that can be easily taken. So water will do for the dehydration.<br/><br/>Though Kyetah never answered the various times I asked, Zakia remained there. And he answered for her. We would put them in the open suite. There, she would have to get by a group of people and not one overly worn priest to escape. If she were to escape again. I announced over the guildstone that she had been found. Where we were taking her. Everyone should know. Not because I wanted to crowd her, but because I want for them to be able and ready to help. Just in case.<br/><br/>Crowding her. I tried to avoid it. I picked only a select few because of that. One personal friend, myself, and another of good intentions who didn't know her personally. I wouldn't have let Carinoth come, but he made that decision. To not allow us to hunt for her, to look for himself. I wouldn't have let him be there at all, because I wasn't certain what condition she would be in. But when he was woken, I knew I had to take him. Because of the condition she could have been in, it would have been easier to have him come to her than to allow herself to realize she would be brought to him. She would have fought.<br/><br/>That made a team of four. I only wanted three. Fyn is such a shy person. She hates crowds. She would hate being smothered in any state of mind and I felt sorry that I had to increase the team size to four. But Carinoth is no tracker. I had the information and I needed to set the hunt up quickly. Once word had been spread, she might have heard. She might have bolted. I had to move them quickly, which tore time away from Zak and Kye.<br/><br/>Kyetah. She wanted to come. And I felt bad, but I had already set my team up. I had already told her about it. She should know, if she cared for Fyn, how the woman would have reacted to five people crowding up on her when I wanted to secure her and move her as quickly as possible. Into a nice quiet room, into warmth and comfort. Farstriders might hate the indoors, but given the condition we found her in, I had assumed right. She's as messed up as the rest of us.<br/><br/>I was surprised that Kye shot the words in such a challenge, though. That she would not be left behind. She would not let Zak go out alone. What did that make us? Was there any point in her words besides wanting to cling to her lover? Though I knew full well how she felt, I hate being apart from my own lover desperately, she ought to know. At least Zak would return. It would only be for an hour or two if luck was on our side. There was no need for her fierceness. And I returned it, because I saw it as being hollow. Truly. It is hollow. <br/><br/>But perhaps, in part, because of something I myself had created. A gap between us. Though I have never spoken ill of her, only complimenting and defending her, she felt nothing of the sort for me. I don't know what I should have done better. Should I have crawled into Zak's room, spoken to her alone? How would I react to her? What if I got angry. Upset. I didn't want to be anywhere near Zak for the longest time. And for the longest time, I only had Silver to keep me company. It hurts. <br/><br/>I kept one friend. I lost one friend. I wanted to keep them both so I gave them both space. For a very long time. I rekindled a friendship with Zak because he was the one I had opened up to first. The one who I told my secrets to. Who knew. I cannot dream. When I sleep, I see another's life. When I needed to talk to him about these things. About this strange feeling of emptiness in my chest at times, as if something in me died a long time ago. As if I had lost something important… I don't know.<br/><br/>We reconnected. I hope. I screwed up too, I can't pretend I'm innocent. We're a lot alike, I don't want to lose her again. I've asked something important of her. It was suggested I ask the entire Fellowship. But I asked her first. I can't ask it of you. It's too strange. I'm sorry. <br/><br/>But maybe you'll like it.

The guildstone went silent and Jana did not know what to think. They were all headed to Pandaria. Something serious was happening yet again. Why were they being targeted this time? What madman was now looking at the Fellowship with malice? Jana knew the Fellowship was strong. She also knew there were a lot of problems. Some of them were hard to overcome. But the basics were still strong.<br/><br/>--------------<br/><br/>Loyalty, to defend the Fellowship and its members to your dying breath no matter what. To stand by each other in our times of struggle and sadness even as our own pile upon us. You do not ask. You simply give.<br/><br/>Honor, to honor your oaths, bonds and promises. Hold true to who you are and never lose sight of the ultimate goal of life. Yet do not blindly chase it, for in all things blindness is the hallmark of a fool.<br/><br/>Valor, to stand upon any field of battle. Whether it be with the sword or with the pen. It matters little how one fights, but one must fight and fight well. Yet it is prudent to remember that sometimes it is best to simply not fight, for patience is the hallmark of wisdom and experience.<br/><br/>Love, for your family, the Fellowship, for your friends, blood relations, and yourself. For your work, for you goals. Love for the ideals that we stand for. For compassion where it is fitting, and mercy when it is called for. For the passion, trust, and life that we all know, and want.<br/><br/>----------------------<br/><br/>Once again they would be tested. Strength lay in staying together. But there was merit in keeping some of them apart for their own safety. As long as the ones after them did not take advantage of the weaker ones by chipping away at them. Jana shivered as she turned to see the silent watcher behind her. The young Sindorei was strange, so thin and frail looking. <br/><br/>Jana went to her and knelt down. "You do not need to fear me, I am Jana Shadowstar. Why do you follow me?" her words soft and gentle, not accusing but curious.<br/><br/>Faeira gazed at Jana with a faraway lost look. "I am Faeira...I am here because I had a vision. I am meant to be here with this Fellowship. They scare me...yet I feel hope and something else. They have needs, each of them...some to come to grips with what life has given them. Some to learn still more of what Fate has in store. But they stay together in spite of problems. It leads the Darkness to them, puts them all at risk. It will test all of them to their limits. Some may not make it out of this alive.." the last bit whispered in fear.

Vanwë took a swig of rum and looked out over the ocean with a grim expression. This new enemy was powerful. Almost too powerful…Whisper had greatly researched everyone of Fynnariel’s associates and from what she discovered of the Fellowship Ratheron was no push over.<br/><br/>The rogue’s duty was done. She got Fyn out of the gutter and back with those who loved her. So why was she still here? Whisper was a criminal. A swashbuckling, rum drinking, information gathering thief. Put something shiny in her face and Whisper would find away to make it hers and fence it to the highest bidder.<br/><br/>The Fellowship was a place of heroes and do gooders. War vets and nobles with high morals and higher expectations. Vanwë was none of these things and if there was ever time she was it was now long gone. So why did she volunteer to help find the man who put Ratheron down? To gather as much information as she could?<br/><br/>Information was easy for Whisper; she had enough contacts in the seedy underworld to get the job done. But there was no pay off for this mission. If she helped out Shade and the others, put her life at risk for them…what was in it for her?<br/><br/>The woman sighed and took another swig of her drink. A tearful blond huntress flashed through her mind, Shade expected more from her and Whisper was tempted to give it. She was a sucker for people more wounded then herself…maybe that’s what was keeping her here? Or maybe the lure of doing something right for once was making its way into what was left of Whispers shattered soul.<br/><br/>Standing Whisper tossed her empty bottle out into the surf and looked back towards Silvermoon City. Was it in her to protect Fyn’s family?

<em>Tislina Dawnrunner sat with her back straight and her eyes distant as she stared into the leaping flames of the fire in the hearth. In her mind, images jumped in the blaze; places, things, people. Images skated before her eyes and memories danced across her mind. It was slightly unnerving to the young mage, and when she could bear it no more, she stood up and left the inn, her thick, fur-lined cloak swirling in her wake.<br/><br/>The mage exhaled deeply when she was outside, watching in something like fascination as her breath fogged in the air before her. Temperatures in Winterspring dropped well into freezing, especially during the night, but Tislina wasn't bothered. Her long, silky robes were more for show than to keep the chill out, but the invisible layer of a frost ward on her skin kept out the bite of the cold. Still, he rubbed her arms as more of a comfort to herself as she looked up at the starry night sky, picking out the constellations she knew.<br/><br/>Turning on her heel, something she was well known for, Tislina began making her way across the small town of Everlook. It was mostly a goblin town, but despite that the air smelled fresh and clean. And she could see the stars particularly well here. The blonde came to a stop once she'd reached what appeared to be a stable. She entereed and immediatley made her way to the small desk where a young blood elf man was napping with his head pillowed on his arms.<br/><br/>Harmon, the young man, was technically the knave of Ayla. He traveled around with Tislina and her mentor everywhere they went and his basic purpose was to take care of any messages they needed delivering. Which was why Tislina poked him now, startling him awake. He yawned, looking up at her blearily. "Oh, hello Tislina," he mumbled groggily, rubbing his eyes.<br/><br/>Under normal circumstances she would have replied and made small talk. She just got right down to business this time. "Did anything come for me?" she asked anxiously, praying inh er head to anyone that would that she had, indeed, recieved some sort of message, even a short one.<br/><br/>Harmon sighed. This routine had been going on for weeks. "No Tislina."<br/><br/>Tislina nodded, staring at a fixed stone to hold her tears back. She had expected this of course. She'd been away from Silvermoon for nearly three months now. She hadn't had contact with anyone she knew, but she'd tried. She couldn't count the number of letters she had sent to Xal, her fiancee. But her hopes sunk lower and lower when he never replied. Had he forgotten about her? Was he hurt? Or worse...? "I understand," she mumbled in reply. "Just let me know if something comes in." Tislina turned to exit, but in her haste her elbow knocked into a massive stack of papers, spilling them onto the floor. "Oh, I'm so sorry," Tislina said, though her usual heart wasn't in it as she stooped to gather the papers back together.<br/><br/>"Wait, Tislina," Harmon said, his voice anxious and almost fearful. Right as he said it, Tis uncovered a bound stack of letters beneath several papers. Frowning, her brows came together as she examined them. Every single letter had the name Xalandir written across the front in her flowing script, the seal on the letters still unbroken. Beneathed those, she found a much smaller stack, some with Solorin's name, some with Alex's, and even two with Kavriel. Every single letter she'd written to the members of the Sunsorrow family since she'd left seemed to be right there in her hands. "Please, Tislina, I can explain," Harmon said feverishly, watching as she stood up, the stack of letters held loosely inh er hand and her face like a stone.<br/><br/>"You didn't send them," she said, her voice devoid of any emotion what so ever. "My letters. You didn't send any of them. My fiancee... he's probably worried about me. He might even be looking for me, thinking I'm in trouble or have left him. All because you didn't send any of my letters."<br/><br/>Tislina would never know what Harmon would have said in reply, for she didn't give him the chance. She left the building, heading back tot he inn. She shoved the letters in her bag as she walked. Upon reaching the inn, she packed up the small amount of belongings she had with her. exiting the inn, she went to seek a mode of transportation. She was leaving, right that moment. She could write to Ayla later, but she needed to go and find Xal before all else.<br/><br/>She was going home.</em>
