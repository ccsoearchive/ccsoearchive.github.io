Windrunner spire was a very rundown place. There were not many ghosts there now, as the workers organized the supplies and got ready to move out. The wagon loads of goods were well wrapped and had been secured for the long trip.<br/><br/>"Neryth we need to keep to the roads, or it will be too slow. The animals are rested now and we can move at night, we can get quite a ways into the plagued lands before dawn. We can rest during the day. The faster we move the sooner we will be safe. I am glad Ratheron trusted us to do this. I know he does not have a very high opinion of me. My fault I guess. I have a mouth that does not know when to stay shut." she was worried she had made a bad first impression and was determined to succeed in this.<br/><br/>Neryth brought up the rear and Pfaedra rode in front of the caravan as they made their way down the darkened road. The rest of the crew were riding on either side of the wagons or on top. Fae kept a sharp eye out and sent a witchlight down the road to frighten off the animals who might interfere with the smooth travel.<br/><br/>They neared the gateway to the plagued lands close to midnight and stopped to give the animals a breather and to drink before moving forward again. The land ahead held some dangers and Fae was worried. She had heard rumors of bandits, and did not relish the thought of fighting.<br/><br/>Neryth assured her he would not let anything happen to her. Fae smiled at him, "I certainly hope your word is good, paladin." with a saucy wink. She did feel safe with him. He was strong and capable, she had worked with him now for several weeks and they got along very well.<br/><br/>The wagons began to move again and Neryth took point this time. Fae bringing up the tail as they moved into the newly renovated lands. It was good to see trees growing and green grass. The druids had made it a point to clean things up and bring the land back from the dry wasteland it once was.<br/><br/>The rolling of the wagon wheels made a noise like thunder as they moved along. Fae could see ahead to where Neryth rode his fine thallassian charger. She wished she could have a horse like that, it was so pretty. Suddenly she heard a shout and saw a flash of Light. Her heart went to her throat and she gasped in surprise. The men in the wagon next to her got ready and the riders looked around for ambush from this end.<br/><br/>A rope snaked out and caught Fae by surprise. It wrapped around her middle and pulled her off the saddle of her mount. She screamed in surprise and anger. "Hey!! Let me go you brute!!" rough hands grabbed her and she looked up into the face of a human rogue. He was not prepared for her reaction. With a burst of fury Fae sent out a blast of arcane in all directions. It knocked the man off his feet and several yards away. She did not waste time and sent a blast of ice in his direction, freezing him to the tree he had fallen against. <br/><br/>The bandits were trying to steal the wagons and Fae was not about to let them get far. The scream of horses and the Light flashing in the front of the caravan had her worried for Neryth. But she knew her duty and let loose with blasts of arcane that sent bandits flying off the wagons. She climbed up on the wagon nearest her and surveyed the fighting. Using icebolts to cut down fleeing bandits and helping her own men to survive. She was no healer but she knew how to deal some damage.<br/><br/>The bandits had not succeeded, but...what a mess! Some of the goods had been spilled onto the road. The draft animals were frightened and needed to be calmed down. Fae looked to Neryth who was riding towards her. "They have left...but we have a mess to clean up and some of the men are hurt."<br/><br/>He rushed to her, "Fae! Are you all right? That was a close call." he looked around at the mess on the road. "Guess we pick it up and rest for a bit. The animals will calm if we let them rest." he went to work healing the minor injuries and got the men to repack what had fallen. Fae sat down and nearly cried. She had not seen them before they had attacked. She had never had to deal with humans either. <br/><br/>She looked up as Neryth came to sit beside her and wrapped his arms around her. "You did great, they are gone and we are all alive. Let's get going. There is a place ahead we can camp and rest for the next few hours. You can make us some tea." he smiled at her and she felt better.

<em>Tislina woke late in the night, or perhaps it was in the wee hours of the morning. Only the stars knew. She sat up, blinking rapidly and looked around at her surroundings. It was dark outside, but the fire was still bright even though it had burned away to only the hot coals and ember coated wood. Fat, soft white snow flakes were slowly and gently making their way to the ground to add to the blanket already on the ground.<br/><br/>Although it was nearly freezing outside, it was warm inside the little tent. Tislina smiled down at Xal still laying asleep beside her as her heart swelled with love and joy. Her cheek was warm where it had laid pillowed against his shoulder. Tislina was reluctant to leave so she lay back down and stayed still for a while, listening to Xal's even breathing.<br/><br/>When it finally became apparent to her that sleep would not be returning to her just yet, she slowly sat up again and exited the tent quietly, taking her journal and quill from her bag on the way out. She sat down beside the last of the fire and opened her journal, slowly, with even scratches and curling script, she began to write.</em><br/><br/>Life is funny in the ways it works.<br/><br/>For such a long time, I was afraid to get too close to any one person because I didn't want to be hurt. When my brother died, it was as if that little part of me that could love unconditionally didn't want to work anymore. I also realized that something seemed to be missing. And so I went about my days, being myself as best I could.<br/><br/>And then I met my first love, Kreindis. I was at last happy to find someone I thought understood me as I am. When you find your first love, it really is as if the world turns for you. And so it made it all the more painful when I discovered that I had not found that missing piece. Krei tried to love me, and I know he did. But I am not certain it was me he loved, more perhaps a shadow of me. I do not know when it was first I realized that he could never fully understand me, as we are too different.<br/><br/>Then came the day I met Xalandir. I stepped into his office because of a determined little fox. I looked at him and it was like that missing piece of me just clicked into place. It's hard for me to think of him as I met him, because he isn't how he once was anymore. With me, at least. When I met him, he seemed so withdrawn and antisocial, not at all a people person. And it was this first aspect that drew me to him. I don't know if I took it as a personal challenge to see if I could get through to the real him or what, but I kept visiting him. <br/><br/>As time went on, I learned more and more about him. It felt a bit like I was getting little bits and pieces of his life each time we spoke. And he kept me safe too. He saved my life from an Orc, from Keyadrion, and he treated the wounds I received. We talked all the time and I actually did manage to get through to him, until the day came when I considered him my best friend. And this is when I realized I wanted things to be different.<br/><br/>While Krei was my lover, if ever I had a problem Xal was always the first to hear of it. I wanted to be near him every chance I got, and when I was elsewhere I often found myself thinking of him. I went out of my way to visit him when I had free time. At first, the feelings were always subtle. But whenever I thought of the future, the thought that someday, some other girl would get to hold him close and kiss him softly, it made my heart ache.<br/><br/>When Kreindis died, it did hurt me deeply, as he had been my lover. I knew that he loved me and I do think loved him, but it was not on the same level. I didn't love Krei as he loved me, unconditionally and devotedly. But how are you supposed to love someone if you've left your heart with another?<br/><br/>My world changed completely, and I know it was for the better. Xal told me he loved me. And I thought I could never be happier. I have heard it said, that only a handful of people mange to find their perfect match. Their soul mate. Their true love. I feel very lucky to count myself among those handful. Xal is perfect because he is like me. Different. And because I am different too, we're the same. Xal understands me, the real me, in a way no one else ever could. I love him so, and I never want to lose him. <br/><br/>People say you can't have the whole world, but I don't want it. All I want is Xalandir. And now, really and truly, I can have him.<br/><br/>Mrs. Tislina Sunsorrow. It has a nice ring to it, wouldn't you agree?<br/><br/><em>Satisfied deeply with her writing, Tislina smiled softly and shut the book and carefully replaced it and her quill in her bag. As quietly as she could, she shuffled back into the tent and laid back down beside Xalandir, snuggling close to him. Sleep came again for her, and when it did she smiled when she slept.</em>

Raina lay on her bed, staring at the ceiling to her small room. It was not hers, but a friends. Her house had been lost.Not just her house, but the dwelling of every Sunreaver in Dalaran. She tightened her fists as she thought about it. She had constant nightmares about that day and the events that took place, and she knew that she would never forgive herself or the ones who caused this to occur. Yet most of all she hated Jaina. She had ordered the purge and had caused the death of many friends. She would get stronger, and would one day exact her revenge on ALL who had wronged the Sunreavers that day.

<strong>Tyrael</strong><br/><br/><em>The black leather of the book seemed familiar, as if it was a copy of a previous journal that was now lost to the man who held it. He had picked it up recently while in Silvermoon and was now sitting, Eve in his lap drawing while he decided to write.</em><br/><br/>Things change. All things must to survive in this world, yet what causes the change? Will it be a near death experience? A person? A simple thought? Always we wonder what will be the defining moments in our lives yet we come to realize that such things aren't for us to try and decipher but to simply live our lives as they come to us.<br/><br/>Never regret. Something I have taken to heart quite literally in my new unlife, ironic that it required me dying once to realize I had any regrets in my life. Ironic that I was once able to get it up easily and to put it where I pleased yet now I can do none of those things. The latter simply is something I don't' want to do, but that is another matter entirely. I sit here and look side-long at Eve and realize if not for her I would be long gone again from this world.<br/><br/>Why did it make me smile? The simple thought of her being here in my arms? Questions upon questions and I seek to unravel them yet they only create more questions. Ah, it is a pain yet for some odd reason I like it. For some reason I don't mind the questions when they revolve around her. The mystery she is, the wall she has built around herself to protect what lies beneath. I understand the wall, I've seen one much like it around my own heart. But mine was destroyed when I died.<br/><br/>Crushed quite literally when i died. Here I sit, promising her a forever when almost a year ago I would have laughed at ever telling one that. Yet here I am giving her everything, she thinks she doesn't deserve it. Neither of us do in all honesty but I won't give it up now. I will fight for it, for every breath and argument.<br/><br/>For every simple touch and kiss. Is this what it means to be in love? Or am I fooling myself? Ah how my doubts and fears gnaw at me, how they defeat my body where enemies have failed to. How everything else pales in comparison to the things I am trying to understand when they involve Eve.<br/><br/>How I wish I could give her everything right at this moment...<br/><br/><em>He closes the journal now, content with what he has written and goes back to watching her draw, preferring it to writing.</em>

&lt;A familiar masked assassin lay upon the ground. Blood streaked the ground behind himself, it was obvious that he had dragged his body across the ground to where he had fallen. A discarded dagger lay next to his outstretched hand, a pool of blood that was not his own rested there, and yet there was nothing to have caused it. No other corpse, nothing. The body was alone, next to a building in Goldenmist Village. The wounds seemed old, the blood dried and crusted. For all the world, he was a corpse. The image a depiction of the horrible reality of dying alone, far from those who knew him, to be found by happenstance. Though the artist knew his form well, and did his image great justice, forgetting not a single scar upon his body, nor detail of his armor, as if she had drawn him a hundred times before and knew every strand of hair which fell across his sightless mask.><br/><br/>&lt;Lying across a bed, on his back, he seemed still. Too still. For so many images which captured a lifelike essence, it was the ones in which death seemed involved in some manner, which were the most eerie. The man's mask removed, he looked as if he was asleep, yet there was a weakness, an almost fragile touch which added to that sense. Yet his entire left shoulder was carefully wrapped, as was an old gash across his chest. His legs were similarly bound, and another wrap around his chest hinted at an unseen wound, or perhaps he had simply been cut diagonally across his chest. Really, it looked like someone had decided to wrap him up and try to form a lopsided star out of bandages. The last two images are the only ones in the artist's personal collection in which Shadowless ever seems to be at peace.><br/><br/>&lt;Two lovers lie on the grass, close to a cliff's edge. Neither have a stitch of clothing to their bodies, but something seems almost serene about this image, a far cry from most passionate images which might suggest something more. Not a detail of their more personal aspects are displayed, and yet there is something far more vulnerable about the two who lay there. Even Tyrael's chest wound is hidden as he has his arms wrapped about the woman's body, lying atop of her with his head resting against her chest, and she, in return holds him close. True tranquility seems to be between them, not as a moment of the lovers in an aspect of the sense that most Sin'dorei are known for, but in a more innocent fashion, as if neither of them knows quite what to do beyond letting their skin touch. Words are written in a delicate, artistic fashion, seeming to be the dialog between the pair. <br/><br/>"I don't deserve this..." the words are topmost on the page, on the corner closest to where the woman's head lay, a subtle indication that they are hers.<br/><br/>"I certainly don't. But now that I have you, I won't ever let you go. Sorry in advance.">

<em>Xal awoke in the wee hours of the morning, watching tis sleep a smile came across his face, once....

It made him extreamly happy, and well what could he do?

The cold wind blew past him without making any effect on the death knight as he strolled the battlements of his keep. Far below in the little valley his grain fields were harvested and the cattle and sheep he had bought were grazing off the leavings. They would make a good start for a small community of settlers. <br/><br/>The forests surrounding the little valley had plenty of lumber and the mines were still relevant. It was too bad that Pfaedra was so enamored of that young paladin. He could see the couple would make a fine family. Getting them away from the likes of the Firehawks was not going to be easy.<br/><br/>But the Fellowship was determined to settle in the plagued lands. Sure it was wide open and had the Argents and the druids looking after the valley. But it was too close to Eversong. Too close to the influence of those who would harm them.<br/><br/>Vivieka had come back from her meeting with Ratheron laughing. "That old fool thinks he cannot trust anyone. He is so absorbed in his own trouble he sees shadows and threats where none exist. I could not convince him I had no ulterior motives to help the Fellowship or House Sunblaze. So I will back off and let him blunder about. The leader of the Fellowship must be very hard up for assistance. And yet they trust a Firehawk. How ironic." she sat in her parlor and briefed Sydric on the meeting.<br/><br/>He chuckled as she told him of how Ratheron tried to be very hard and cold, as if he did not care. "He is getting senile, Sydric. The ghosts of his past haunt him. His very upbringing makes it impossible to trust anyone not in his immediate control. I had thought time with the Pandaren would season him to keep an open mind. Apparantly I was wrong about him. Perhaps I should pull Pfaedra out of there and find her another place to train."<br/><br/>Sydric shrugged as he gazed out the window. "I know where she is, just give the word and I will fetch her. Though I surmise she will not come willingly. I may have to coerce her cooperation."<br/><br/>Vivi sighed, "Sydric, Fae has found more warmth and friendship there than she has ever had. Her last letter proved that. She is enamored of this paladin Neryth. I will not force her to leave. In spite of my misgivings, she will make her own decisions. I do hope she can convince this Ratheron I mean them no harm. Or Lady Keltira perhaps. I used to see her in the City. She is a strong paladin. They have survived much over the years. She cares for them as if they were her own flesh and blood. It is why I sent Fae there. I want her to grow strong and have strong ties of friendship, not political machinations that change with the wind."<br/><br/>Sydric turned to her and smiled. "Why not make a peace offering to the Fellowship? A gift of sorts. You have all these connections. Use your instincts, Vivi. Convince him you are not the monster he sees you as. Bloodmages are not widely accepted, you know that." he smoothed his chin and turned to the window in thought.<br/><br/>Vivi stopped her pacing a moment and turned to him. "How can I prove myself trustworthy of an elf who trusts no one? What would convince him? Sell out a secret of someone who trusts me? Sacrifice my first born?" her full of sarcasm.<br/><br/>Sydric pulled a packet out of his bags and handed it to her. "Perhaps this will help. Send it to him. Let him know you have ears and eyes in more places than he even knows about. Show yourself to be an asset. These are the ones you asked me to look into. There are three of them plotting, as you surmised. They plan on approaching the Firehawks within the next week. See if he has any idea who they are. Let him know these are 'former' associates who lost your trust."<br/><br/>Vivi took the packet and opened it, her eyes grew cold. "I knew it...they were simply using my position of influence. If they go to the Firehawks they will not only cause trouble for the Fellowship, but for me personally. They should not survive another day...I want their blood, Sydric. It will make me very happy." she smiled. <br/><br/>Calling for a private courier she took the contents of the packet and sealed it in a magically encrypted wax. "Take this to Pfaedra. Tell her it is to be opened by Ratheron and it is keyed to him. Anyone else trying to open it will be cursed. Tell her to present it as a gift from me. Understood?"<br/><br/>The courier bowed low and nodded, "Yes, Milady, directly to Pfaedra. And she is to give it to Ratheron personally and he is the only one who can open it safely." he saluted and ran out the door.

<em>from the pages of my journal:</em><br/><br/>My heart and my mind are at odds against each other, and it is tearing me a part. I have caused another paladin to doubt herself, and the pain of the memories of Karamia's leaving me was just as fresh today as they were those many years ago.<br/><br/>"<em><strong>I'm losing my focus, Cyaer, I need to return to my first love, the Light, and find out if we are meant to be together</strong></em>". Then Karamia was gone. Those weeks and months were the most miserable time I could have ever lived through. Had I, a rogue, stolen her Light? I only knew that I loved her, and that she was my soulmate, the one who would be the mother of my children...my wife.<br/><br/>Now here I was again, I had lead Kel'tira, my wife, down the wrong path. I knew it had been wrong, and yet I convinced her to come with me. She was married, and I was in love with Karamia Dawnstrike. And yet, I almost...Light, what was I thinking? Why did I do such a thing?<br/><br/>I remember the pain and anguish that Mia had felt and expressed to me. I didn't deserve her. Now...do I deserve Kel'tira? I see it on her face, and I see it in her eyes...that same pain and anguish...<br/><br/>They say you hurt the ones you love, I didn't...I don't want to hurt her anymore. Thus my mind carries this terrible thing I wrought, oh so long ago.<br/><br/>My heart, well, my heart tells me otherwise. <span class="underline">We</span> need each other, especially now. This is a moment in <span class="underline">our</span> relationship that will define <span class="underline">us</span> as a couple, as husband and wife, and as individuals. And I will stand by her side throughout <span class="underline">our</span> lives together, for I know, I KNOW, that <span class="underline">our</span> love is strong, and <span class="underline">we</span> can withstand this storm, and <span class="underline">we</span> will survive this.<br/><br/>For it isn't just about me, or just about Kel'tira, but it is about <span class="underline">us</span>. And I have faith in <span class="underline">our</span> love...I have faith in <span class="underline">our</span> love because it is a strong and honest love. And it is a true love. It isn't about me, it's about <strong><span class="underline">we</span></strong>. And I'm finding "<strong><span class="underline">us</span></strong>" to be the way I want to be with that woman.<br/><br/>Light! I love and need Kel'tira...every day, in every way...I love and need her.

I inspected the wagons before we began our trek to the Plaguelands. Everything was in order and allowed Phaedra to take the lead on their way to the gateway that would take them to their destination. I smiled as I watched her on her steed, lighting the way and taking care of trail creatures that may have found us tempting.<br/><br/>As we rested at the gate, Fae voiced her concerns of bandits on the road in the Plaguelands. I vowed I would protect her, and I took the lead as we entered the Plaguelands. I was watchful, and was not surprised by the threat of the bandits as they attacked our caravan of wagons. I jumped from my charger and prepared to protect all our supplies, when I heard Fae's scream. <br/><br/>My shield was flung at two of the bandits as they tried to pull off one of the teamsters leading our wagons. Several of the guards alongside the wagon took care of them, as I made my way to the back of the wagons where I knew Fae was. Again, my shield would spring from my arm, stunning the bandits, and I started to realize that the mage had things well in hand towards the back of the line. I shield slammed one of the escaping bandits that tried to get away from her spells. <br/><br/>I returned to the front, and aided the guards in fending off the bandits to the sides and front of the teams of horses. Many of the teams of horses were spooked, and the teamsters were having a hard time calming them. But we were victorious in holding off and defeating the bandits.<br/><br/>I slipped onto my charger and rode back to see how Fae had fared. I listened to her as I rode up to her, and began using the Light to heal the minor wounds of the guards and teamsters. We gathered the spilled supplies and moved to a place up the road where we could calm the horses, and make sure that all was well. <br/><br/>As we made our way along the road to the new home of the Fellowship, I rode back and forth along the line of wagons, speaking here and there with the men on top the wagons, and those that worked the teams pulling the wagons, giving them morale support and joking with some of the others. When I heard a sudden crash and a scream of a team of horses.<br/><br/>A wheel had broken and the wagon leaned to the side. I jumped off the charger, and got several of the teamsters to help me lift the wagon's side, so we could replace the wheel. I felt my muscles bulge and stretch as we lifted the heavy load to accomadate the wheel replacement. When we set the wagon back upon new wheel and I wiped my hands off, I happened to notice Fae, watching me and a small smile come to her lips. I smiled back at her, with a sudden blush on my face.<br/><br/>The rest of the long journey to our final destination was uneventful, and I enjoyed speaking with Fae as we rested and shared a cup of tea on occassion. When we arrived, I helped unload several of the wagons, into a large barn that would make a good distribution center for the supplies. We set up camps and waited for the others to join us.<br/><br/>We had done what was expected of us, and fended off bandits and gotten the supplies to the new Rising Sun Fellowship's home. I was so proud of Pfaedra, and I told her so.

<em>Loyalty’s strength is sorely tested,<br/><br/>Valor’s bonds broken and bested,<br/><br/>Yet strong they stand and face the end,<br/><br/>The rising tides of horror on friend<br/><br/>Bound together by fellowship’s ties,<br/><br/>With strength of old, heroes shall rise.<br/><br/>Salvation found in the unlikeliest places,<br/><br/>And love’s touch is put through its paces.<br/><br/>Yet Darkness is all that can be seen...</em><br/><br/>Tychus looked around the area, it was obvious they had cleared it out only recently. It was also obvious that they had needed every second they had bought with their nipping attacks. “Whoever is in charge knows what they are doing. I rather like how this is turning out...” Tychus drawled happily, he didn’t mind the chase. In fact he enjoyed it, it was the part of the game that excited him the most. “Where are they headed?” Tychus asked, turning to look at his “officers” wondering if any of them knew, “Eastern Plaguelands my lord, the ruins of the Scarlet Enclave. Scouts report seeing the caravan assaulted by bandits. Yuri here interrogated them and found out where it was headed.” Targus was the first to speak and it was obvious that he was dying to destroy this group.<br/><br/>“Interested, so they seek to build upon the ashes of the old. Symbolic of them yet foolish. They are now cornered, hemmed in. We shall destroy them.” Tychus said the last words as he turned to regard the form of Aserius, the head of House Firehawk was weak and it looked like he would keel over at any moment. “As for you, it is with regret that I inform you that you are no longer needed.” Tychus laughed as Aserius tried to rise, tried to defend himself yet he fell to his knees. “Oh oh! The little man wishes to fight! Splendid!” Tychus hopped around Aserius and clapped, acting like a child who had just woken up on Christmas morning.<br/><br/>“You... promise...” Aserius whispered, the words so soft that it might have been a mistake what they heard but Tychus didn’t care simply laughing. “Promised? No I never promise, they are as worthless as the Light is. You see Aserius I was always going to kill you yet the Fellowship did it for me. Amazing how that works, someone else doing my work for me!” Tychus grinned as he motioned for two of his Shadow Knights to pick Aserius up so that the Sin’dorei was on his knees looking at Tychus. “You see Aserius there is only Darkness. This Fellowship is a blight upon the world, much like the Horde and much like the Alliance. They all are blind, scampering around trying to stop what they believe is evil in this world.” Tychus shakes his head and pouts, “All I am trying to do is show you and them, how pathetic all your attempts are at controlling your lives are.”<br/><br/>Tychus laughed, it was obvious the man was mad yet he looked as sane as Aserius! “This world needs to be cleansed, my masters will cleanse it! They will bring about a new world order that will make all of this,” Tychus waves his hand around, as if referring to the fighting the destruction as nothing more than an annoyance, “Go away! For for the world to be brought to its true potential. Its true -glory- we must burn it to the ground... For from the fire will rise the new world!” Tychus all but cries as those around him grin and chuckle, it was their dream.<br/><br/>“You are mad...” Aserius mutters, coughing up some blood as he says it and Tychus laughs, “Yes yes! I am mad! Insane!” Tychus cries as he then grabs Aserius’ head and pushes his entire consciousness into the Sin’dorei. “Let me show you just how insane!” He cries with mad glee, his thoughts pouring past the mage’s defenses as if they were nothing more than a piece of paper, cut into ribbons, and Aserius cried out in pain. He cried out in fear and wondered how it was this man stayed together! Tychus showed him everything, his humble beginnings, his training the world he grew up in and as they progressed it shifted, the landscapes running together until Aserius and Tychus were alone in a black environment...<br/><br/>“Do you feel them?” Tychus roared at Aserius and at first the mage felt nothing but pain and fear. But as he realized where they were he felt them. At first it was just gibberish but soon Tychus translated it for him and what he heard forced cries of anguish and pure terror from his throat.<br/><br/>“Do not fear little mage... Your sacrifice, your inability to understand. You will come to know what we are...” The said in unison, their voices both melodic and chaotic. It was chaos all around Aserius, flashes of color; battles waged, wars fought lives taken. He watched history unravel around him, he watched as everything he knew spun into nothingness and then was put back together the way it was and then the process repeated itself. “Make it stop...” Aserius cried and as he said it the laughter started.<br/><br/>((1/2))

It was low at first, quiet yet it grew in volume and Aserius realized he would go mad just listening to it. “Ahhhh! Make it stop!” He cried his hands moving to his ears yet he couldn’t move he couldn’t even breath he realized as everything physical ceased to exist. Ceased to make sense and suddenly Aserius realized he was alone in this black place, alone on his own as he stared into the dark hollow eyes in front of him. “You will learn...” The voice said again and the last thing Aserius heard was the laughter of Tychus....<br/><br/>Tychus sighed as he signaled for the men to drop Aserius’ body, the corpse dissolving slowly and Tychus grinning, “Well he will serve a higher calling now! Let us make haste towards the Fellowship. I wish to see this thing done with so that we can continue to push the war forward. Things on the Isle of Thunder go poorly for the Thunder King and his allies, the Shado-Pan prove to be a voice of reason to the Alliance and Horde there sadly.” Tychus said as he ushered his officers to get the men moving. At his command they rushed forward and began issuing orders the few hundred of them there were marshalling quickly and heading south.<br/><br/>Darkness was coming for the Fellowship.<br/><br/>((2/2))

<strong><span class="underline">Ryelth Sunraine</span></strong><br/><br/>A small , cloth wrapped journal with the mark of the Sunraine house stamped on the front.<br/><br/>Dear journal, and anyone who is reading it, let me introduce myself.My name is Ryelth Sunraine of the Sunraine house, and I am a Mage of the academy of Dalaran, or at least I was.Last night I was caught reading about forbidden magic in the library of Dalarn, and the last thing I remember was feeling a sharp pain in my forehead before I became unconscious. I woke up from the bright sunlight on the building of a strange place filed with red and gold buildings.A blue sea went out as long as I could see a ways ahead,and mana wyrms and lynxes roamed the green grass freely.Standing over me on an albino crane was a beautiful blood elf.She had oranges hair and a fair face.He green eyes glowed softly with a look of amusement, and her lips formed a smirk. "Nice place for nap huh?" She said with a hint of sarcasm.I sat up groggily and looked her straight in the eyes"Where are we?" I asked her."Sunstrider Isle,always has been,always will be." She replied. I sat up and looked around,then remembering the incident in Dalaran moaned.,"Why,why did I have to do that." the girl looked at me funnily," Do what?" She asked."I was caught researching forbidden magic..." He replied warily.Se grinned at him wickedly, she must be a warlock, I thought.Suddenly, I ran to mailbox.Inside was a letter addressed to me in scrawling handwriting and sealed with the symbol of the academy of Dalaran. I opened the letter,and unrolled the parchment contained within.It read "Dear Ryelth of the Sunraine house, we are regretted to inform you that you have been expelled from the university of Dalaran, and hope you find somewhere else to research forbidden magic.<br/>Sincerely,<br/>Archmage of Dalaran<br/>"No....." I muttered "No no no no no!<br/>How could this be happening to me?I turned back to the blood elf, who had been watching me intently,and almost cried."Now I'm broke, homeless, and friendless."the girl studied him,"You could always join the Fellowship of the Rising Sun, I joined because they needed recruits." I pondered this, and the woman helped me join the fellowship.She gave me a stone to contact members and left me to help the civilians of the Isle.Before she left, she introduced herself as Zarina( I think).<br/><br/>I write to you now as I sit on a mound of pillows inside the largest building of the Isle.I wil write again soon.
