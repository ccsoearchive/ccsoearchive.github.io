Yet he had to ask himself was life what he wanted? Did he want to return to the land of the living? Was it what he wanted? He wasn’t sure anymore on anything so he sighed, “It is alright.” He said quietly as he noticed her only picking at her food now. He ate a few more bites of his meat and then turned to gaze at her with a stern look. “I think its time we were honest with each other.” He said after a short period of just looking at her, he didn’t make it clear what he was wanting to be honest about but it was clear he would accept nothing less.<br/><br/>“Very well,” she replied calmly. Yet, that very question did arise in her mind. What did he want for her to be honest about. “Ask, and I shall answer.”<br/><br/>Smiles, “You haven’t told me much about anything. You’ve listened and been forward about why you are here yet you continue to hide behind a mask. You continue to hide and not be honest and forward with me. Why?” Tyrael asks simply, he would have her answer. Was it fear that stopped her? Or something more? Something else? All of these questions rebounded through his mind as he took another bite of the Yak and then pushed the plate away, a smile still on his face, not for her but for those who might look their way.<br/><br/>“Who and what I am is not acceptable to this mission,” she stated bluntly. “I am altering my entire personality just to fit what you need right at this moment. What you don’t need is a woman who cannot handle these situations, who cannot smile until her face hurts, and who only wants to walk away because these people disgust her. You do not need someone who is snarky and gets offended at the touch of a nerve.”<br/><br/>Letting those words flow as they did hurt. Not emotionally, nor did it damage an ego which hardly existed. She felt another sharp pain in her head. The alteration itself went beyond putting on a mask. She had become someone else entirely because he had asked for her to come with him. She held that smile so calmly, so serenely, as if nothing was wrong with this. It was her life, and how she lived. It was why Shadowless had also learned to never cross this woman, though the lesson had been a painful one she wouldn’t recount in her deepest nightmares.<br/><br/>“Would you care to dance?” she inquired in her sweetest tone.<br/><br/>Tyrael shook his head, as ever in awe of this woman, “One day I will learn your secrets...” He murmured as he stood, draining his champagne glass and offering her his hand, “Let’s dance my lady.” He said politely in a rigid tone. It was obvious she had hurt him with her words, he felt that she hid who she was not for the reasons she listed, even if they were valid but because she didn’t trust him. He was a Death Knight, undead, a monster what hope did he have of ever getting her to think better of him? None.<br/><br/>Tyrael smiled as he led them down the stairs and to the dance floor, spinning Eve out into the middle of the floor as he gracefully followed her. A smile was on his face but it wasn’t his own, it was devilish and dashing but it wasn’t Tyrael smiling at her. It was the man his father had wanted him to become. It was obvious to those who knew him that this was someone who could walk in the highest circles and be the talk of the party, be the life of it. Whereas Tyrael might scoff at all this wasted time and simply bull his way through and be straightforward this version of him was subtle and cunning.<br/><br/>This Tyrael could turn friend against friend and foe into ally, this was a different kind of dangerous.<br/><br/>If Eve cowered in fear of this man, it was hidden beneath an expression of nigh worship. A woman to compliment his personification, for he would most certainly be thrilled to be his date’s center of attention. And yet, that very word, his very questioning of her being, made her begin to wonder. He wanted for her to have fun, he wanted for her to accept this as the date that it was. But that was not something she could do and still be an effective tool. So, what did he want from her?<br/><br/>She fell into stride with him, her movements nearly flawless. It wasn’t because she had spent so much time practicing dancing, but because she had been forced to do so. She read his movements, predicted them, and let her body do the work while she kept her focus on him. On that mask that he donned. Perhaps he was hiding from her as well, now. She didn’t chase after Tyrael, instead letting Tyr guide her. And yet, she leaned in close to whisper to him, to speak softly, in nearly a seductive purr. Probably a compliment to their dancing, one might think.<br/><br/>“One day, I might let you...” a whisper, perhaps a promise. She wasn’t certain if she ever would. She had to wait and see. So far, today had been the first day for him to not yell at her, to not snap, and to not threaten or act violently upon her. And, bitterly she reminded herself it was in part because today was the day she had not even been herself.<br/><br/>(12/Many)

He grinned even wider as he twirled her, spinning her once, twice and then around his body, using his hands and feet to guide their motion as he then catches her and dips her, his own lips moving to her ear, “I had better get to see more of the real you. I rather enjoy it.” He murmured, whether as a threat against her hiding herself or a true compliment on her personality he didn’t let on. He simply lifted back up and continued their small dance on the dance floor, Tyrael let the beat of the music dictate how they danced, flowing between the changing of the songs smoothly. It was obvious he had a lot of practice and whether it was from his own desire to learn or a forced practice it was hard to tell.<br/><br/>For a moment, her mind grew blank at his words. Confused. She was very confused by this man. Slowly, she shook her head before pushing his words from her mind to be examined later. Her eyes closed as she enjoyed the music, the sway of his body, how her own responded automatically. As if they had been made for this, born for this, as if this was their element and they complemented each other. Perfect.<br/><br/>Her thoughts drifted, her mind searching as she began to focus on those around them, far more than her dance partner. When they drew closer to the group he had targeted, a group she recognized due to having observed them earlier, she began to listen, not only with her ears, but with her mind. The distance caused her vision to blur, and thus, she closed her eyes, resting her head against his shoulder lightly.<br/><br/>“-- is expecting a child. Hopefully a boy. They could use an heir...”<br/><br/>“-- absolutely was delicious...”<br/><br/>“-- wouldn’t give to get a piece of that...”<br/><br/>Useless thoughts. Useless voices. How strange that people gossip in their own minds as well as to each other. Yet, what more could she expect from people like this? She shook her head and searched harder.<br/><br/>“-- really like her...” the thought was in Tyr’s mind. Had she not been trained, she would have stepped on his foot by mistake.<br/><br/>“-- easy to chase the Fellowship out of Silvermoon. They won’t get far...” her mind locked onto one useful thought. Apparently the topic of their victories had come up, for the group’s mind focused on boastful thoughts.<br/><br/>“Can’t believe that House Sunblaze would be willing to go down in flames for the likes of them...”<br/><br/>“Hopefully The Black Hand will prove its use...”<br/><br/>The song ended and Eve came to a stop and looked up at Tyr. She didn’t let it slip from her lips or into her expression that she had caught his thoughts, instead taking a step back to curtsy to her partner, as was expected at the end of the song. Her entire body felt weak and numb, her vision swam and she felt that she might very well lose her dinner.<br/><br/>“Thank you, Tyr,” she smiled at him. “You are a wonderful dance partner,” she set her hand against his forearm, offering a subtle tug. If he was done on here, she had gathered some information. Without one target to pinpoint, she realized that she had overreached her limits by searching an entire group. While she could normally last through multiple songs, she couldn’t hold out past one. Luckily, she had waited, as she always did, to make it not look strange that she would pull him out to dance for only one song before retreating in a winded state.<br/><br/>As always, her training paid off.<br/><br/>Tyrael changed their dance to a more relaxing one as she rested her head on his shoulder, enjoying the contact as he wrapped an arm around her slim waist and slowly moved them around the area, one hand holding hers as he guided them around the floor listening to the gossip. Tyrael didn’t focus in on the words but on the movements of their lips as he approached where and he didn’t like what it was he was interpreting them to say so he moved closer to hear.<br/><br/>“... Honestly I don’t know why Lord Aserius thought that this human had any potential.”<br/><br/>“He’s a sorcerer he has power we’ve already seen some of it... He promised the Lord his son back...”<br/><br/>Tyrael had to move them away lest they appear to be eavesdropping but what he heard disturbed him and his face showed it, even under the mask. Tyrael simply nodded at Eve and walked away from the dance floor with her on his arm. “Hael can we get a private room please? I only need an hour, we won’t be there long.” Tyrael murmured quietly and the owner bowed and produced a key and handed it to them. “Your favorite.” He said quietly and shooed them away. Tyrael led the way down a side hallway and into the room, unlocking it with the key and then locking and bolting it.<br/><br/>Tyrael grumbled as he pulled his tie down a bit and unbuttoned the top button of his shirt. He took off his jacket and threw it on the lavish bed and unbuttoning the vest as well. He then started pacing the room. “So you tell me what you learned.” He murmured as he paced.<br/><br/>(13/Many)

Silently, she observed him. Weakened severely, she followed him to the bed so that she could sit. Leaning forward, she removed that mask, letting him see just how pale she was beneath it. A hand rose to pinch the bridge of her nose as she focused on not vomiting from the strain of long distance mind reading.<br/><br/>“They’ve chased the Fellowship out of Silvermoon, they’re that overwhelmed...” she spoke, her voice betraying her weakness. She let the mask slip, let her mind be free, or she knew that there would be greater risks than vomiting. Her hand once again searched for her drawing pad, but there was nothing, so she continued to speak.<br/><br/>“House Sunblaze, I would assume that is Kel’tira’s, is backing the Fellowship. There may very well be hell to pay for it...” she took a deep breath as she looked up at him, watched him work off the burning energy from the evening, and found herself smiling faintly, despite the grim nature of her report. “There is also a group called The Black Hand involved... I’m not quite certain who they are, unfortunately. I couldn’t get anymore than that...” her voice trailed off into a near whisper, the apology sounding in her tone as she watched him.<br/><br/>There was nothing proud, nor regal about her in that moment. She knew that she looked as sickly as she felt, the draw backs on her both mentally and physically showing. Though, her own mind began to wander back over Tyr as she watched him. Thinking over his words, his thoughts, and then looking around the room. ‘His favorite.’<br/><br/>“What about you?” she inquired.<br/><br/>Tyrael turned to look at her and noticed her pale features he moved forward to kneel next to her on the bed. He listened partially to what she said as he let his fingers trace her face and check her vitals as he tried to get her to look into his eyes. Failing that he got up and moved over to the small sink and filled a bowl with water, grabbing a cloth and bringing it over to the bed. He wet the cloth and ringed it out and then used it against her forehead, not sure this was helping but he hoped he could.<br/><br/>“I learned something a mercenary group led by a human who promised my father the resurrection of his son.” He murmured quietly, it was all coming full circle and it was bothering him just how much it pained him to realize his father had bargained with the enemy for his life. “We should leave the city soon, when you are feeling better. But we shall be sneaking out of here in short order. Only reason I liked this room for doing business...” He muttered quietly as he moved along the wall and found the small depression that he slid his finger into.<br/><br/>“... Is because it has a secret passage built into it.” He said with satisfaction as the door was swung inward with a soft click. He then turned to her and moved closer as he grabbed his coat and threw it around her shoulders, looking into her eyes, “Don’t make me carry you.” He whispered with a slight smirk on his face as he moved to pick her up, throwing one of her arms over his shoulders as he slid his hands, one around her back and the other under her thighs, ready to pick her up if she couldn’t walk.<br/><br/>Watching him passively, she forced herself to regain hold, control. When she realized that they would be leaving and not returning, a sigh of relief escaped her. Suddenly, she laughed at him as he made as if to pick her up. Dear Light, he was a strange man. But, she couldn’t blame him for it. Not if he wasn’t used to working with someone like her. Or with someone like her unit.<br/><br/>“‘Push yourself’, they always told me. ‘Push yourself until you break. Then, once you know your limit, take one step back. Do not cross that line in the field’. Tyrael, I’m fine,” she pulled away from him, but kept his coat on her shoulders. It felt nice, protecting her bare skin from the air. She missed her robe dearly. Rising, she made her way to the passage but looked to him to see if he wanted to lead or for her to leave first.<br/><br/>“Do not mistake me for someone who would make that sort of mistake...” still, she couldn’t help at be amused by his care and his tenderness. It was a change of pace from what she was used to. “Just as I told you yesterday. My things are packed. I only need to pick them up and I am ready to leave...” she sighed, shaking her head at him. He really did underestimate her.<br/><br/>He smiled at her and shook his head, “There is nothing to apologize for. Also I already had your things put into the carriage. We will be using it to get out of the city and to a small hideaway I have. Quickly though, we must move quickly. The Fellowship is at risk and we need to find the rogue, I fear we will need his services.” Tyrael murmured as he stepped up behind her and motioned for her to go first, he himself turned to look and knew that Hael would be able to get in after the allotted hour. He always did.<br/><br/>(14/Many)

“I am sorry...” she murmured, once they were on their way. It was good to know that he was prepared for this, that he had things set up. Forcing her numb limbs to move, she knew that she could survive until they were in the carriage. Until that point, she would simply have to keep going forward on the strength she had reserved for only this moment.<br/><br/>“Since I didn’t have one target, but a group, my focus was lacking. I heard something else...” she admitted in the confines of the passageway, keeping her pace up, eager to be free of it.<br/><br/>Tyrael followed her quickly, “Oh? What did you hear?” Wondering now if she might have gone into his mind and heard him thinking about her, he wasn’t opposed her finding out but it bothered him slightly she had found out this way. Especially considering they were both wearing masks, both literally and figuratively during the evening. As they pushed through they suddenly appeared in the Court of the Sun he then moved to the carriage that was sitting right in front of them and opened the door for her to get in.<br/><br/>“Quickly.” He said quietly as he helped her into the carriage and then joined her, the driver nodding as the door shut and setting off at a reasonable pace. It wouldn’t give away they were leaving the city for any reason other than to reach their estate for the evening even if they were running.<br/><br/>Only once they were safe did she find a suitable way to answer him. Safe inside of the carriage, she laid down, the rocking movements causing her head to swim again. She shut her eyes tight and forced herself to breathe, to speak. At least, for now, she could rest.<br/><br/>“I saw that you really mean that you want to get to know me better...” she attempted Shadowless’s route, speaking the truth, but without telling the truth. Her eyes focused on the ground, on his feet as a wave of nausea hit her. Pinching the bridge of her nose again, she grew silent. She had already apologized to him, for she had forgotten to mention that this was a side effect of what she had done, and what she will continue to do.<br/><br/>“That scares me, honestly...” she admitted, finally. There was no more need for a mask. That was why she had left hers, abandoned on the bed back there. Drawing that hand away from her face, she grabbed at the pin which held her hair in place. Pulling it out, she felt pressure come from her temples as she let the pale golden strands fall messily about her face. Not even bothering to correct it, her gaze lifted back to Tyr.<br/><br/>“Even if you learn to like me, you will also learn to hate me, Tyrael. I am one of those people who will be alone. You might trust me because I follow through with what I say I will do. I may never ask anything of you. But you, too, will learn to question me. You will forget how to trust me. And without trust, there is nothing, can never be anything, and will never be anything.”<br/><br/>Tyrael laughed quietly, listening to everything she said and it made him laugh for a bit longer. “You mistake me for someone who is normal, when I trust someone I never take it back. They earn it for all time.” He paused as he watched her hair fall into her face and he lifted a hand to brush it out of her face and behind her ears, “You have earned my trust, albeit you do get on my nerves on occasion but I think we both get on each others nerves.” He said quietly, the words slow in coming out as they left the gates of Silvermoon and the carriage slowed down, easing the bouncing and jostling to a more controlled levels.<br/><br/>Tyrael pulled Eve closer, his arms going around her as he tries to get her to relax. He pulled his own mask off his face now his own, a quiet calm having settled on his face, his eyes full of a hidden emotion that looked like care but it was hard to tell. “You need not worry about scaring me off or hurting me.” He said with a grin and a wink as he looked out on Eversong and watched as they headed west towards his small hideaway.<br/><br/>(15/15)

I met someone, today.<br/><br/>No, wait, let me start all over again.<br/><br/>I stole a board today.<br/><br/>The guild board! I was sneaking around, when I realized that no one had taken down the board. And there was still a notice on it about where we were meeting! That was dangerous. So I stole the notes. And the board. And everything. Now nothing is left. Even though the Firehawks probably already saw it, if they were there.<br/><br/>I got the board out of the city, but I didn't know what to do with it. <br/><br/>I kind of set it on fire.<br/><br/>And this paladin kind of saw me.<br/><br/>I tried to fight him, and he tried to fight me. But in the end, no one fought, so it was okay. It turns out that he was a member of the Fellowship! He was injured, so he let me get something out of the city for him. I hope he'll be okay...<br/><br/>Turns out that Nicias is alive. Not doing all that well, but he's alive. I ended up telling the paladin about Kel remarrying. Not because I think it's my place, not because I wanted to... but because I was afraid he would bring Nic straight to Kel. And a healing man who's been through a lot of horrible things doesn't need to come back to have his heart ripped out. <br/><br/>I feel like I'm going to puke. I feel so horrible for Nic. For Kel. For Cy. Everyone's feelings are going to get hurt. Even if Kel stays with Cy, he'll still be ruffled, probably. Even if she goes back to Nic, Nic will be ruffled. Probably. <br/><br/>I need to cuddle my lover. <br/><br/>Heh. My lover. <br/><br/>&lt;She draws a heart, but it doesn't look as if she put much effort into it. It's not even sparkly.>

&lt;Despite the fact that he wore a mask, it was still the same man who has been covering the majority of her artwork over the past few pages. He stood tall. Proud. Regal. He wore an air which commanded respect, attention, oozing power and nobility. Dressed fancily in a tuxedo, he invitingly held his hand out towards no one, a devilish grin playing across his lips as he stood at a partial bow. Yet, one could still tell that, beneath his clothing, he was a warrior. <br/><br/>The mask hid his undeath well, and his features were so animated in that moment, it could very well have been a drawing of him before his death. He didn't look out of place, but he didn't look like the same man from the last pictures at all. Without his armor, without his anger or his smile, or even that silly pout, it was as if someone else had invaded the man's body. He was one of those people that one could look at and knew that they would never get close to someone like that. As if he was in his own world. And it was truly another world when it came to nobles.><br/><br/>&lt;At a cliff side, overlooking the ocean with the trees depicted clearly those found in Eversong woods, that armored man stands. The dying light of the sunset washes over his body, casting a long shadow behind himself. Like a rock he stood, a soldier standing guard. The only thing betraying what he was being that armor which he wore, a weary set to his usually rigid appearance, as if he now carried a heavy burden. With the broad expanse of the cliff on either side of his figure, he was alone. No one stood with him, no one was there by his side. And yet, he stood there regardless, for he had a purpose. He held his head high, wearing a new air which didn't speak of a noble background, but of a pride within himself that would remain until he fell once more.>

&lt;Dense mists rose and fell, rolling along silently like waves in the air. A figure stepped through them, parting them, her footfalls soft. Careful. Predatory. Blue-green eyes, like a dark ocean, scan the area. She knew that she was not alone. A gorgeous white leopard with markings like clouds on his pelt prowled in stride with the huntress, his eyes ablaze with a fierce azure mist. The same essence which poured from his mouth with every breath. The only thing left to assure the man that this human was a hunter was the large bow at her back. But it was the fel-tainted dagger at her side that held his attention the most.<br/><br/>Suddenly, her eyes shot in his direction. Despite his use of the mists for stealth, she seemed to sense his presence. Notching an arrow, she drew. He knew that if he moved, she would see him and would shoot. If he stood still, she would shoot anyway. There was a reason this woman had come to be known as Demon. She was merciless, hating, spiteful, angry, everything which made her fighting so delicious to watch, to endure.<br/><br/>He rushed her.<br/><br/>Breaking from the mist, she miscalculated her shot due to his choice to decline retreat. Her eyes narrowed, the focus in her eyes, the intensity, all making Shadowless's heart sore as he lashed out towards her. She mistook his first strike as being aimed at her, and brought her bow up to block. His blade gracefully slid along the harsh surface with a screech of protest before slipping free and slashing inward. Catching her bow string, he cut through it. <br/><br/>A furious roar sounded, and he flicked his free hand towards the cat, tossing the pellet of powder at his face. It exploded, sending spores over his eyes, blinding him as it irritated his nose and mouth when the poor thing inhaled. Grinning as the monstrosity known as a spirit beast fell to the ground, flailing, he turned his attention onto his real prey.<br/><br/>She had already drawn her dagger, and to his delight, had dropped back just far enough that, by the time he had lunged again to close the gap, had drawn a second blade from her boot. Perfectly, their blades met in the air. He pulled back to strike again.<br/><br/>Throughout the mists, their weapons clashed. They danced, spun, twirled, and she met him, strike for strike. She merely was trying to buy time, time for Karma to catch up to her, to turn this battle on its side so that she could draw string and fix her bow. He wouldn't allow this. Another slash, and she was caught by surprise when he made a feign and instead cut the front pouch on her belt. It fell to the ground and he kicked it to the side.<br/><br/>Suddenly, she dropped her arms as she growled at him.<br/><br/>"You prick!" the human shouted at him in rough Thalassian. "Fine if you cut my bow string, but seriously? Urgh!"<br/><br/>Shadowless laughed as Demon stormed towards the pouch to pick it up, then shoved it into his chest.<br/><br/>"Fix it!"<br/><br/>"Yes, m'lady," the rogue balanced the pouch and his daggers as she went to take care of Karma, who was still choking on his powders. Settling down, he pulled out the same needle and thread he had used to sew his own armor back together after Tyrael had almost slashed him in half. Once she had managed to settle her pet down, the assassin threw the pouch back to her, far from good as new, but he was no leatherworker to begin with. He simply carried what he needed to survive.<br/><br/>"What do you want, Shadowless?" she spoke in Common, now.<br/><br/>"Will you--" he began in the same language, only to be cut off by the human.<br/><br/>"No!" she snapped.<br/><br/>"You just asked--"<br/><br/>"!@#$ off!" she snapped again.<br/><br/>"De--"<br/><br/>"Silver!" <br/><br/>He stopped and raised an eyebrow.<br/><br/>"And here I thought Eve was the mind reader," he brushed fingers through his bangs. Silver's eyes remained narrowed for a bit longer before she began to laugh softly. Even if she was only teasing him, it was still astounding to see her expression shift from pissed to hilariously amused.<br/><br/>"Ah! But that was a nice surprise. As always, Ares," she purred his name as she slipped closer to him. The Sin'dorei raised an eyebrow as he watched her suspiciously, knowing that she might decide she was angry again at any moment and shove that fel-tainted blade where the sun didn't shine.

"Thank you, Saberial," he replied dryly. "Now, will you--"<br/><br/>"I said no," she snapped before looking back down at Karma. "Look. I have a life, now. Outside of that…" she waved a hand. "Stuff."<br/><br/>"You all but swore yourself to it after the war against the Lich King," he raised an eyebrow at her. <br/><br/>"Yes. And then I got bored and I do what I always do! I moved on. Maybe you should do the same," she scowled. His eyebrow couldn't go any higher at that point.<br/><br/>"Are you pregnant?" he inquired. He knew Silver to be flippant, but this was ridiculous. When her face colored, he grinned slyly.<br/><br/>"No!" she denied.<br/><br/>"Mm-hm…" he sighed. She was worthless to him, it seemed. "I needed a good tracker to help Risalyn out of a problem, but…"<br/><br/>"What's wrong with Risa?" Silver glared at him. "What did you do to her?"<br/><br/>"Nothing!" he sighed. Why did everyone always take him for the bad guy? "Her group is in need of some aid. I got a letter…" he drew a scrap of paper which was snatched up by the human faster than a starving Westfall hobo could eat a grain of rice.<br/><br/>"Nobles fighting… Rising Sun Fellowship… Need everyone we can get…" she skim red through the long list of problems rising in the former mage's life. "Urgh… Why can't you people just stop being in trouble all of the damn time!" she shouted at no one in particular. "I'm retired!"<br/><br/>"You haven't even been fighting for a fraction of the time I've been alive!" Shadowless laughed.<br/><br/>"Sh'up Ares," Silver drawled before shoving the letter back at him. "They're a Horde group, right? I can't get involved anyway…" she looked away from him. "Directly."<br/><br/>"That's my girl," Shadowless purred as he rose from the ground to wrap an arm around her. The woman tensed as she tugged him in closer. "So, who's the lucky man, anyway?"<br/><br/>"Go !@#$ a haystack," she smiled before jerking away from him. Shadowless held his hands up as he laughed, only to find a fist in his stomach. <br/><br/>Many a man had called him lucky, he thought bitterly as he left Demon to her thoughts. Working with two women. Rubbing his stomach, he retreated with most of his pride intact, trying to ignore how his skin was burning, itching. There was nothing lucky about working with a psychotic human who was bi-polar and a priestess who could make you wish you were dead through torturing you with a single gaze. <br/><br/>"I should just stop trying," he mused to himself. Maybe it was time to get a boyfriend. At least then he wouldn't have to deal with all of the PMS. His sulking lasted for a scant few seconds, however, before he was beyond it. His wound was healing nicely and he had already resumed his personal training. Now was not the time to relax. Something was coming his way. He nearly salivated at the thought. Perhaps someone powerful. Something he could fight. Something on his level that would challenge himself and his muse.>

The scurry of activity in the Hall of Respite was unusual. Jana saw them packing things and moving them out. She stopped one of the workers and asked. "The Fellowship is leaving the city, it's all I know. If you are part of them, you will have to meet with one of them to get directions to their new place." he scurried off and she sighed.<br/><br/>So much for being away and working. She had not taken time to speak on the guild stone much. She listened to it from time to time, Cyaer had given it to her with instructions and all. She trusted him, he was a good Sindorei. Lord Sunblaze, and Kel'Tira were the heads of a House that was in turmoil. This she knew, her contacts in the House had assured her the Fellowship was supported, but on the run.<br/><br/>Finding a quiet corner she faded into the shadows and watched as a figure came in and stole the board from the wall. Intrigued she followed to watch from afar but lost the wily rogue outside of the city. In frustration she finally contacted Pfaedra and was told of the meeting and its import. The mage was flustered and upset. It seemed the monk Ratheron had discounted her as young and inexperienced. <br/><br/>Jana soothed the mage as best she could. "Cousin, do not fret. You are young, but you will be a powerful Magister some day. Live and learn, as we all do. Respect him and show him you are not flustered by his comments. Be dignified, not flustered. You show your inexperience by your actions. Now tell me where they are going so I can report to Aunt Vivi."<br/><br/>Pfaedra calmed considerably and sighed. She was young, and she had a lot to learn. She had to face it and get her confidence back. She would prove to Kel'Tira and Cyaer that she would be a help to them and not a problem as they seemed to think. "Kel'Tira has asked to meet with Vivieka. We need to set up a place where they can meet in safety. I suggest that Vivi meet with Ratheron. Currently he is the acting head of the Fellowship and the one to contact. Viv knows more of politics than I do, she will know how to handle things I am sure."<br/><br/>Jana nodded to the young mage and asked for a time and place for them to meet. She vaguely wondered how the Fellowship could keep in contact if they were so scattered. Though she imagined they used their guildstones. Perhaps they were safer and less obstrusive if they scattered . She did not like it however, if any of them ran into problems how would they ever help each other?

Hyjal was still fighting off fire elementals, but Vivieka Blackthorn was in her element. Her blood magic was useful and could take many forms, fire being her favorite. She knew fire well, it was a bright and useful tool. Her face impassive as she cast firebolts at her enemies. Collecting the precious red fluid in vials after they lay weakened before her. The druids looked sickened by her methods, but she used the dying heartbeats of her enemies to fill vial after vial and stored them in her special bags. "I do this to save the forest and keep the Firelord from his goal. It seems to me you need my help. Do not question my magic, it is old and respected for its power."<br/><br/>Her stern visage covered by a deep red hood. Only the bright glare of her fel green eyes peeked from within, her smile covered by a veil of crimson. The druids may not like her use of blood but they did begrudgingly accept her worth. Malfurian gazed at her with disapproval and dismissed the blood mage from the battle. "Go and seek battle elsewhere, your methods are sickening my people. I am told they need help still in Deepholm, the residual effects of the world sundering are still evident."<br/><br/>He was glad to see her go, although she had proved invaluable, he could not stomach her use of blood any longer than necessary. He turned to his assistants and got to work revitalizing the forests of Hyjal, not giving Vivieka another thought.<br/><br/>Chuckling to herself, Vivi returned to Silvermoon City. The long days of fighting in Hyjal made her weary and she need a respite. Taking along her two favorite retainers she went to the exclusive club favored by the elite of Sindorei society. The long deep red gown covered her modestly, but the silk molded to her every curve. Her raven locks piled on her head and sparkled with gems hidden in the strands. The mask covered her face entirely and was styled in the same pattern of the snake following close behind her. An intricate pattern of colors that made the eye dizzy trying to follow it. <br/><br/>Her table overlooked the dance floor and she saw many she did not recognize. Of course that was the object of the masks. Allowing the nobles to enjoy an evening of pleasure without the risk of House feuds erupting. Vivi had a way of identifying most of them however. Her intimate knowledge of the many heads of Houses had given her many nights of pleasure. None of them knew of the agents she had in place. Servants who were well trained to remain hidden and report to her only when they had news.<br/><br/>She watched as a couple of unfamiliar figures floated over the dance floor. Her consort followed her eyes and made a dry comment. "The ones you have noticed are unknown to me, My Lady. Do you wish further investigations?" his intuitive manner made him invaluable to her. The couple in question soon disappeared behind closed doors and she shrugged. <br/><br/>"Just another Sindorei intrigue to follow. If it pleases you to find out who they are, feel free. I have agents in nearly every House. Things are getting heated between two very old and established Houses. I will show my hand shortly, but not yet. The time is not right." her hands fiddled with the brandy snifter. The deep red of the blackberry brandy intrigued her, it was the color of blood as it welled from a wound. She sipped it delicately, enjoying the flavor.<br/><br/>As the evening wore on she noted the Head of the Firehawk House and frowned slightly. She did not have anything against the House from the past, finding them an honorable Sindorei staple. But he had been gathering power for quite some time now and she had to wonder why. Her agents did not have anything to report other than the Lord himself was very ill. She could see that in his features and wondered how long he had left.<br/><br/>The Firehawks were looking to absorb this Fellowship she had heard of and she had placed a niece in the organization to learn more. Pfaedra was a good Sindorei, very idealistic and also a bit naïve. She needed more seasoning, and Vivi thought the Sunblaze House could offer her some training in the arts of intrigue, not to mention she needed training in her chosen field.<br/><br/>The following day Vivieka called for Pfaedra and asked for a report. She was stunned to hear the Fellowship had left Silvermoon. "I need to meet with Lord and Lady Sunblaze. Arrange it for me Pfaedra. Be discreet. Tell them I offer help. Nothing more. If I need to speak with this Ratheron, I will do so. I seem to recall he is a member of the Firehawk House. When you see him next ask him if he remembers me. We met many years ago in Silvermoon. It was brief however and he might not remember me. I was impressed with his calm manner and skills. I will send a letter to him and to the Sunblaze House as well. Time is of the essence, girl. Stick to your training and do not ruffle the Firehawks!! In fact if what you say is true, stay out of Silvermoon for now." her mind raced as she contemplated her options.

The mage was fuming, her composure was totally blown as she left the meeting. That monk and his companion were so sure of themselves! They discounted her every word with veiled insults. He even called her young one as if she were a child! <br/><br/>Her subsequent meeting with Vivieka only brought it home to her with a resounding thud. She was young, and she needed seasoning, as her aunt called it. She blushed in the face of her aunt's words. "I am sorry Aunt Vivi, I will try harder to be discreet. But he was so condescending!"<br/><br/>Vivi gave her orders and Pfaedra had no choice but to obey her elder. The House of Blackthorn was one of the oldest, and often discounted because of its size. But it had ties to all of the warlock Houses and Vivi had solid loyalty from most of them without openly supporting them. Besides a contingent of troops were always available from any one of them. She had only need to ask and they would march to the defense of the blood mage.<br/><br/>Pfaedra went from her quarters in Silvermoon and contacted as many of the members of the Fellowship as she had met. Hustling them out of the city in small groups to avoid suspicion. She could do this, she was determined to help out Lord and Lady Sunblaze as much as she could.

<em>from the pages of my journal:</em><br/><br/>I have been talking with Kel'tira concerning the House and all the directives she has given me. One thing that came to my mind was that perhaps we should remove the charter and registration that is on record. My fear was the Firehawks would begin harassing the other Houses involved in the Fellowship. Kel thought about it, and said that might be a good idea.<br/><br/>So I prepared to make a break into the Archives, when my love told me that Tislina would be in the Archives. Well, I'm not so foolish as to think Tis couldn't do what I was thinking of doing, so I wrote her a quick note asking her to seek the records and charter of the Fellowship, to alleviate possible trouble from the Firehawks in the future, and that we would return those records after all of this Firehawk trouble blew over. I can only hope she received it before she entered the Archives.<br/><br/>I have contacted Azmos to aid Neryth in leaving the city, Neryth has the repaired new Fellowship commstones, it would not do to have them fall into the Firehawks hands. Also, Az needs to join us in this new situation with the Firehawks, and I trust him.<br/><br/>I have conversed with the House engineers, and gave them a few of my ideas. They seemed excited about working on them, as well as setting up some of the House defenses. I trust they have enough time in preparing for the inevitable. I tried my best to allay any fears and boost morale wherever I could.<br/><br/>I set up the packing and moving of supplies and such as Ratheron had mentioned. I have several House teamsters taking a special load of equipment and supplies from the House. I can only hope the Light watches over that wagon. It contains a special surprise for my love.<br/><br/>One last letter, and I shall rest beside my beloved. This one to Yinhon the Pandaren I stood up for in joining the Fellowship. I'm not sure this is good having a front seat to a House takeover and the intrigue, but he wants to experience the Horde, and so he will get a taste of it. Light let it be an experience that's a good one. I have asked him to talk to the Tauren, Jakota, and alert him to leave Silvermoon City for their own safety. I can only hope they make it out without incident.<br/><br/>We move from place to place, living for the moment and together...I love my wife, but this puts more pressure and anxiety upon her shoulders, and I watch over her, and protect her. I hold her, and give her massages to relax her. I cannot wait until this Firehawk situation is over. And I can relax with Kel'tira. <br/><br/>I worry for her.

<em>Tislina Dawnrunner stepped at an even gait through the streets of Silvermoon, doing her best to look natural. Only someone very close to her would notice the slightest hesitation of her feet as she moved. They would also notice the stubborn set to her jaw and the determined glint in her eyes. As she walked she went over the events of the past few days in her head. The Fellowship was practically at war with the Firehawk House, and she would never have known if Kel hadn’t contacted her beforehand. She should have gone to the meeting, she told herself. But it had been the same night as a magical assessment. She didn’t think it would be that large of a deal to miss one meeting. But come to find out she shouldn’t have missed that one. Tislina was willing to do nearly anything to help the Fellowship. Which is what brought her into the current situation.<br/><br/>Taking a deep breath, her step became even more even as she gained confidence, nodding politely to the guards standing in front of the towers. Tislina walked this path every day, why should now be any different? Of course she knew exactly why it should. ‘No hesitation,’ she reminded herself as she entered the towers and navigated through the many halls and flights of stairs until she came to the door she wanted. The word ‘Archives’ was written flourishingly on a simple gold plaque hung on the door. Smoothing out her robes, Tislina pushed open the door and slapped an expression on her face that said she was all business. <br/><br/>The young Sin’dorei boy behind the main desk looked up startled, clearly not expecting to have any visitors this late in the evening.<br/><br/>“Can I help you miss?” he asked hurriedly. He was young, Tislina noted. Far younger then even she was. Perhaps he was apprenticed to a magister. She nodded slowly as she crossed the room and set her hands palm down on the desk.<br/><br/>“Yes,” she said slowly, her tone even. “I need access into the Archives."<br/><br/>“Of...Of course,” he stuttered, frantically pulling a large ledger from the drawer of his desk and thumping it on the desk. “If I could just have you name and the name of the House you belong too, you can go right on down.”<br/><br/>Now came the hard part, this Tislina knew. “I’m not a member of any of the houses,” she said formally, her voice hard. <br/><br/>He glanced at her helplessly. “But…but the rules state…”<br/><br/>Tislina knew this must be hard on him and she really did feel bad for having to manipulate him. But it was for the Fellowship. “I am Tislina Dawnrunner, apprentice to Ayla Rainsong. As an arch mage’s apprentice, I have the right to access the archives anytime I deem necessary. You will let me down and you will not be needing my name."<br/><br/>At the boy's horrified look, Tislina sighed and lowered her voice. She hadn't wanted to play this card but it seemed she had no other choice. "Listen, I know this all seems really strange. The thing is..." she paused to take a deep breath. "I'm self exiled from the Dawnrunner House. All I want to do is view my families records without my whole House knowing. Do you understand now?" she asked gently.  <br/><br/>The boy, looking entirely relieved, gave a small, feeble nod. "Yes ma'am, I understand now. I'm really supposed to make you sign in, but I'll make this one exception if you don't tell anyone. Go ahead and go down."<br/><br/>Tislina smiled and nodded her thanks, then quickly moved to the back of the room where the stair case led down into the earth, into the Archives.<br/><br/>(1/4)</em>

<em>The spiral staircase was dank and had that earthy smell of too much underuse. Braziers nailed to the wall lit the way at regular intervals, though Tislina kept a small fire in her hand anyways, cradling it close to her body as she walked. After what felt like an agonizing eternity, Tislina reached the end of the steps and stood in the vast Hall of the Records. Tislina gazed around the Hall of Records, trying to see where it ended as she always did. As usual she couldn't. The braziers here were set into intervals around the many vaults but didn't provide much light. The fire in her hand, however, cast dancing shadows all along the walls. Tislina sighed and it echoed. Why did this place of to be so eerie?  <br/><br/>Tislina first went to the right, along the rows of vaults with the names of the various Noble Houses printed over them on bronze plaques. Some of the plaques were so old and faded that they weren't legible anymore. Others were shiny and new. Tislina recognized most of the Houses, though some she had never heard of. She assumed they were Houses long passed. The vaults were in rows alphabetically and Tislina didn't glance at a single of the Ds, fearing she would see her own House's vault. Instead she let her mind wander a bit. She thought of what a pain it must be to have a name starting with a letter toward the back of the alphabet and having to walk all the way back. Tis felt a pang of sympathy suddenly. Kel was probably one of those people with a name like Sunblaze.<br/><br/>She had probably been walking for fifteen minutes until she found the vault she was looking for. She stopped to examine it, the name 'Firehawk' flashing down at her from it's shiny plaque. Taking a deep breath, she held her fire in one hand and placed the tips of her fingers on the vault's door. She sent a small spark of arcane magic into the mechanisms, a trick she had come up with herself. She learned a lot about the door very quickly. Titanium. Four feet thick. Double locking mechanism. There would be only one key. If Tis had to guess where it was she'd assume locked up tight with Aserius Firehawk. The key would be the only way to open the door. Unless...unless someone had magic.<br/><br/>Tislina took a deep breath as she stepped back. If she used magic to open this door, if she entered the vault, if she stole any important records as Kel had asked, there could be no going back. She was about to steal. From a major noble house at that. If she was caught, the consequences would be severe. But. Tislina Dawnrunner didn't let people down, especially not the Fellowship. She pressed her palm to the door and shot a blast of arcane into the mechanisms this time. The door made a loud creak as it swung open, revealing the gaping maw of blackness inside.<br/><br/>Tislina stepped into the thresh hold. The first thing she did was magically light the braziers in the vault. Then she stood and gazed around is dismay. There were so many shelves, so much information, how could she ever go through it all in an hour?<br/><br/>An hour. That was the estimate Tislina had given for the time she had. An hour before she was sure the Firehawks would figure something was wrong. And then...it was only a matter of time before they were after her. She needed to get what she needed and get out before that time came. 'And I have magic to help me,' she reminded herself. Reluctantly she extinguished her fire and brought her hands up.<br/><br/>And just like that, books and papers flew about the room, leaving sparkling arcane residue in their wake.<br/><br/>The first papers to fly in front of her face for her examination were what looked like physical and social information. Height, weight, birthdays, parents, siblings of the various members of the House. Nothing of interest. She summoned up the more recent papers and examined them instead. These yielded much better results.<br/><br/>The first thing she discovered were requests for support. These ranged anywhere from wanting support from other Houses to Blood Knights to some mercenary groups. Assuming this classified as 'important records' Tislina directed the papers into the empty bag she had brought for this occasion. Thereafter she discovered political documents and troop orders. She tucked thoses away nearly with the other documents. The last thing she found was detailed documents on all the other major Noble Houses. Some of which detailed spies within, particularly spies in the Sunblaze House.<br/><br/>These bothered Tislina the most, and not just because there were spies amongst the Sunblazes. Suppose one of these documents should contain information on the Dawnrunner House, her own family? Or worse, could the Dawnrunners offer support to the Firehawks? Tislina longed to look through the papers and see what she could uncover, but she knew it was not get place, nor did she have time. 'Once I'm safe and out of the city,' she thought, 'I will write Katalia a letter. I've got no other choice.'<br/><br/>(2/4)<br/></em>

<em>Satisfied with her solution, Tislina tucked the last of the papers away and looked around. It would be easy for her to magically put all the documents back where they belonged. Instead, she abruptly stopped her flow of magic, causing books and papers to fall and scatter about the floor. She grinned. Tislina may not have been able to do much, but at least she could put some stress on one of the Firehawks. Of course they'd know for a fact documents were stolen when they saw the mess, but she figured they'd find out anyway. So what was the big deal?<br/><br/>Extinguishing the braziers and closing the vaults door, Tislina started back the way she came. She had only one more task to complete here and then she could leave the city. Her internal clock told her she had around half an hour to finish up what she needed to do.<br/><br/>Unexpectedly, Tislina found herself in front of yet another vault. Perhaps she had intended to do this all along. Perhaps that was why she had so quickly accepted the tasks given to her. She didn't know. Tislina unclenched her fist, revealing the small bronze key she had dug out of her bag. The key that she had left at the bottom of her dresser for years to be forgotten. With a feeling of calm settling over her, Tislina inserted the key into the Dawnrunner vault.<br/><br/>The inside was similar to the Firehawks vault as Tislina's eyes adjusted to the fire she had just lit in the braziers. What was she doing in here? She didn't have time for this! 'Who knows when you'll get to come back to Silvermoon?' a small voice in her head seemed to say. 'This is your last chance!' Tislina took a deep breath. As fast as she could, her hands trembling, she began to dash about the room, tucking papers into her other empty bag. She wished she could take it all, her family's things, but knew there wasn't time. The last thing she took was a thick, old, leather bound tome, the cover faded black with an image of a white rose. She stuffed it into her bag and ran out without a second thought, plunging the vault into darkness once again.<br/><br/>Shaking now, from fear or the realization at what she had done, Tislina ran. She was all too aware of the clock ticking as it seemed to race against her, making her run faster. She ran blindly, unsure of where she was until she found the dozens of shelves stacked with record books. She exhaled shakily. She was lucky, so lucky that she had ended up here. Squaring her shoulders, she calmed herself slightly. It was time to complete Cyaer's request. The letter he had written her was tucked safely in the bag she had left in her study hall, but she remembered his words clearly.<br/><br/>It was tedious work, going through all the record books as she couldn't simply do this one task with magic. Her process was agonizingly slow and time seemed to dash by her at top speed. Her hands were shaking so badly at this point that she could barely turn the pages. Her heart was hammering so loud in her chest she was surprised it didn't echo off the walls as everything else did. Finally, at long last she found what it was she had been looking for. Within the record she currently held, she saw it like a light in the dark. The Rising Sun Fellowship's charter. And all of its records. Just as Cy had asked. She shivered slightly as she saw her own name on the list, but her heart sang out.<br/><br/> Tislina simply shoved the whole registration into her last bag and bolted to her feet. She had what she needed. She could get out of the city now. Out of the city and somewhere safe. Since Kel was in hiding, Tislina had already decided to give all the information she had acquired to Cyaer. All the information, except the Dawnrunners. Her families information, she had decided, was for her eyes only. But the registration and the Firehawk documents, of course she'd give those up.<br/><br/>Heart in her throat, Tislins began walking quickly back toward the staircase, desperately wanting to get out of there and above ground. Now in a hurry, it didn't take her long to find the stairs and take them up, two at a time. She was aware she had exceeded her time limit and that any minute, someone could happen upon her. Upon reaching the lobby, Tislina gasped for breath and looked around frantically. She was alone in the room except for the boy who had fallen asleep with his head pillowed on his arms.<br/><br/>The tiniest sense of relief came over her, but Tislina knew she wasn't out of the woods yet. Far from it actually. Forcing her step to seem calm and casual, Tislina left the room and found herself back out in the hallway of the towers. She briskly began walking away down the hall, hoping anyone seeing her would attribute her pace as having somewhere to be rather then from fear. As she turned the corner out of the corner of her eye, coming up the hall toward the Archives were two men. Redoubling her fear, she hurried off down the hall, sure the men were working for Firehawks. <br/><br/>(3/4)</em>

<em>Tislina practically ran down the hall thereafter, her mind itself running wild. Would the two men check the Archives themselves or just ask the boy? More importantly, had they seen her turning the corner? Were they pursuing her even now? Tislina couldn't be sure, but she did feel bad for the boy and hoped no harm would come to him. That was just the kind of person she was.<br/><br/>After dashing down halls and vaulting up stairs, Tislina found herself in front of her private rooms. She burst through the door without a second thought, but stopped short in horror. "Ayla," she breathed out. Her mentor stood in the center of the room, looking at her. "Ayla," Tislina repeated, swallowing hard. "I...I can explain."<br/><br/>Ayla shook her head brusquely. "You don't have time. Hurry and get your things."<br/><br/>Tislins started in shock. "You mean you know what's going on?"<br/><br/>A thin smile graced Ayla's lips. "No, I do not. But whatever it is I can tell it is important to you and that you could be in danger. Two men came looking for you a few moments ago. Of course I didn't tell them where you were even though I had my suspicions. You remember our way of messaging?" At Tislina's nod, she went on. "Good. Get out of the city, get somewhere safe, and then you can explain to me what is going on."<br/><br/>Tislina smiled brightly at her. "I will," she said quickly as she retrieved her bag from her desk. It contained all the things she thought she'd need. Her journal and quill, a few of her arcane tomes, and changes of clothing. Tislina was about to scoop up Mobious, who had fallen asleep on the chair when Ayla cleared her throat. Tislina turned to see her holding out yet another bag, a sheepish smile on her face.<br/><br/>"I knew something was bothering you today during practice since you weren't focused hardly at all and that's so unlike you. Call it intuition, but I thought you might need to go somewhere. I don't know how long you'll be gone or even where you're going, but I put this together for you. It's several meals. I know you can conjure you're own food, but sometimes you want something else. I made everything myself and there's also healing salves in the pockets in case of emergency. Please be careful?" she finished in a rush.<br/><br/>Tislina wasted no time in surging forward to hug her. "Thank you Ayla. For everything."<br/><br/>"No Tislina. Thank you," Ayla said distantly, hugging her apprentice tightly before handing her the bag. Tislina quickly swung it over her shoulder. With a last smile at Ayla, Tislina gathered Mobious into her arms and left the towers.<br/><br/>Alone again, Tislina felt her fear rise back up. She felt exposed out on the streets, but she walked as fast as she dared to the gates of Silvermoon. Once she was officially out of the city but still near the gates she paused. She needed to find Cyaer and get him the information. She had heard the Fellowship was supposed to get as far from Silvermoon as possible, but she couldn't go. Not yet. What if Cyaer wasn't there yet? And more importantly, what about Xal? Were the Firehawks after him too? Had they already gotten to him? <br/><br/>Panic threatened to overwhelm her but she forced it down with common sense. Xal was fine. She had to believe that. However, she refused to leave without knowing where he was. Tislina was certain he would do the same for her. In addition, she still needed to locate Cyaer and get him the information she had stolen. That could prove vital. In the end, Tislins decided to stay in the area one more night. Her first thought was to go and stay with Alex, but she couldn't bring herself to do so for fear she would bring down the wrath of the Firehawks on the girl who was practically her best friend.<br/><br/>So she stayed a most uncomfortable and sleepless night at the Farstrider's Retreat. She lay awake, stroking Mobious' fur as she jumped at the tiniest of sounds, praying morning would arrive soon.<br/><br/>(4/4)</em>

"I don't have time to explain it all, Az, I need you to help Neryth get out of the city as soon and as fast as you can. Time is essential, and Az, don't let anything happen to the boy, he's important to the Fellowship right now. Hurry"<br/><br/>This was the last communication I received from Lord Sunblaze last night, and I could detect the desperation in his voice. The Fellowship was being hunted by House Firehawk, and we needed to exit the city, NOW! Oh, how I wish I had attended that last meeting a few days ago. But that was all water under the bridge, I needed to find the lad and get him out of Silvermoon City safely.<br/><br/>It was late afternoon as I strolled across the Royal Gold Exchange Parkway. It was an excellent day in the city, the sun was warm, and the birds were singing within the boughs of the trees. I moved steadily towards the Blood Knight Hall, and their forge. Cy said he worked there most days, I could only hope he was there today. As I turned the corner, and entered the training area I could here the ringing of a hammer on anvil and I picked up my pace.<br/><br/>He really wasn't a boy by any stretch of the term, he was a young man sweating over a hot forge, and glowing bars of some sort of ore. He was very fit, and even I could tell he was at his physical prime. I laid my hand on his shoulder and told him we needed to depart the city as soon as possible. He looked me in the eyes, and I don't believe I have ever felt so scrutinized in a look as I did right then. He turned and spoke to another man, and told him he had to leave, and he may not be back. The older man, nodded, and faired him well. <br/><br/>We hardly spoke as he lead me back through the parkway and into the Fellowship Hall. It was quiet here, far to quiet, and we walked back through a back hallway to another area, a studio of some sort. He started packing right away, several sketch pads, many pencils and several parcels of clothing. "I take it you were aware that something was afoot?, I asked.<br/><br/>"Yes, I suspected a few things, there were several rumors flooding the Blood Knight barracks about House Sunblaze, and I figured the Fellowship was only coming into it" the young Sin'dorei replied. "And I knew Cyaer would not want these falling into anyone's hands except the Fellowship members." He said this as he picked up two heavy sacks. <br/><br/>'And they are?" I felt stupid in asking but I had been out of the Fellowship information loop far too long.<br/><br/>"These, my friend, are the new commstones for the Fellowship. Better and more improved over these old stones by over 200%, maybe more." He smiled as he hefted the two bags and shouldered them easily. He made for the front door, and said the Shepherd's Gate was just a few hundred feet away. So we made our way towards it.<br/><br/>Now there are usually a contingency of city guards hanging about the Shepherd's Gate, checking identifications, vendor licenses and such. So Neryth and I made our way slowly out the gate when I noticed several of the guards moving to follow us further out onto the road. We had crossed the causeway and we were headed to the Farstrider Retreat when one of the guards told us to stop.<br/><br/>(1/3)

I turned to look at the two guards that stood before us, and my first impression was that these were not Silvermoon City guards. Their tabards did not bear Silvermoon City insignia but a stylized hawk surrounded by flames. And I acted perturbed, "What is the meaning of this! I am on church business and do not have time to stand here on a dirt road!"<br/><br/>"We beg your pardon, milord, we believe this young man with you is wanted, and we are placing him under arrest. Now if you will allow us to..."<br/><br/>"I will not! This is preposterous! I have known this lad for many years, and he has been nothing but stellar in his service to me and my family. You are mistaken, now I am in a hurry. Leave us be." And I turned in huff to make as though to leave.<br/><br/>"No! You will stand aside, sir, while we arrest him and take him with us." The guard was rather rude and went to grab Neryth's arm, and of course I couldn't allow it, so as I turned to face them I cast a quick spell that sent them running back to where they had come from.<br/><br/>"Neryth, run! The spell will not last long, and they will soon return with reinforcements I am sure." And even as I told the paladin to run, he had started running towards Farstrider. I ran alongside him when I heard the shouts behind us. I look over my shoulder and there were now four of the Firehawks behind us. <br/><br/>My first thought was for Neryth to get away, so as we ran I cast a defensive shield about him which also allowed him to pick up some speed, and I watched him move quickly way. I slowed, and turned to face the four "guards". <br/><br/>"You have made a big mistake, old man." one of the guards yelled as he pulled up to me. I threw the same spell I had before, not wishing to hurt anyone, only to seek escape. And watched as three of the guards turned tail and ran as though the hounds of hell were nipping at their feet. <br/><br/>The only guard left had taken his sword out and slashed at me. I was rather surprised when a shield fell in front of me and blocked the attack! Neryth had come back behind me, and threw himsel to block the blow intended for me "Neryth, you fool, run! I can take care of someone the likes of him. Now, go!" I said hurriedly.<br/><br/>And the young paladin stood his guard in front of me, shield up and sword ready. I shook my head as I cast the shield of protection upon him to keep him from harm. And the guard stuck at Neryth, "You're coming with us, both of you, you are under arrest!", he yelled. <br/><br/>Neryth must have been in defensive mode, for the blow struck his shield again, and I heard the paladin groan under the impact. I could see the other Firehawks coming up the hill towards us, and I knew I had to throw my preservations of harming them away.<br/><br/>I cast the spell I was loathe to use, and watched as the dark tendrils arose from the ground and grabbed at two of the passing Firehawks. Their screams hurt my ears as they were flailed about. And the third guard stood back in fear at what I had cast.<br/><br/>Time was short, and I cast another shield over Neryth as the other began to dissipate. Then I cast the two spells that were my staple spells to kill or injure that which meant me harm. I watched as the Holy Fire struck the Firehawk fighting Neryth, and he stood in shock, as I cast smite after smite into his person.<br/><br/>(2/3)

His body slumped to the ground as the other three, now free from the spell that had held them, made their way cautiously towards us. "Murderer!" one of them cried.<br/><br/>Neryth stood looking at me, and I yelled at him, "Run, damn it! Run, and don't stop!". As he ran past me I cast the shield to hasten his steps. And watched him move away swiftly. Fool! I stood looking at the three closing in on me. "Leave us be, I beseech you, or the Light be my witness, I will not let you pass!"<br/><br/>They slowed, and that was enough time for me to cause them great pain, and discomfort. They bent over the pain intense and building internally. Then I let loose my fiend. I hate the darkness yet they left me no choice. The fiend sprang forward and killed one of them quickly, the other two drew themselves up to defend themselves, pain etched in their faces. The fiend began attacking the one of the others when it reached to the sky and screeched out it agony at leaving this world.<br/><br/>I felt a renewal of my magical reserves as it died, and cast a shield on myself and ran away from the two Firehawks left writhing in agony. I ran and so found myself closing on Neryth. We exchanged looks and kept on running. I cast two more shields as we disappeared into the Ghostlands.<br/><br/>I was never so sorry to have used my Light to slay men as I did that afternoon. However, I have Neryth safely tucked away, and we will make our way out of the jurisdiction of the Firehawks and the city. We will contact Cyaer and let him know where we are. We stay in the wilderness, away from patrols and such. <br/><br/>Light forgive me for what I did. And Neryth, that young man, touched me with the Light and I felt better in what I had to do. He amazes me, the Light is so strong with this paladin. I have never felt it so strong in one so young.<br/><br/>Perhaps Cyaer was right in wanting him safely away.<br/><br/>(3/3)

<em>As I stepped off of the translocator in Silvermoon City, I was assaulted by a great bear who threw me down on the ground, and held me down. Just as I was about to become the Great cat and tear his throat out, he spoke to me quietly.<br/><br/>His voice was soft, and had a distinct accent to it, "Forgive me, my brother, it is dangerous to be wearing the tabard of our Fellowship, especially here in Silvermoon City. It would be wise to remove it and leave here, as your life may be in jeopardy if you stay." He gently helped me up, and began removing his own tabard, and folded it and stuffed it into his backpack.<br/><br/>"What is going on, why must I hide who I have come to support for their ways in the world? I have embraced the tenets of the Fellowship, and I want an answer!" Even so, I removed my tabard and looked at it, my large hands touching the emblem of my new people. <br/><br/>"My brother...our Fellowship is being hunted, and we...we need to stay away from here. There is another House that seeks to take over our Fellowship. And we must be cautious in our ways so as not to fall into any snares or traps our foe sets before us. This comes down from the elders of the Fellowship." His eyes were earnest as he talked to me, and I felt I could trust what he said.<br/><br/>I placed my hands on his shoulders, and thanked him for being there to alert me to this new situation , and policy. He in turn placed his paws? upon my shoulders, and looked me in the eye, and told me it was an honor to tell me and warn me. <br/><br/>I have never met one such as he, and asked him to join me in travelling to the orc city. He nodded, and he picked up his backpack. We stepped through the translocator and for the flying ships that would take us to the orc city. We exchanged names and talked over many beers. <br/><br/>He has a large capacity for holding his beer.</em>
